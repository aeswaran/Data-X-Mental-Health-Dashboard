Major changes (copy/pasted from President Salovey's email)

\-  When spring recess ends and through April 5 at the earliest, classes will be held using Zoom, Canvas, or other online tools. I know classes take many forms across the university, so this shift to online teaching and learning raises many questions. Deans will be communicating with their faculty and students to provide further details in the days ahead. 

\-  We are asking Yale College students to remain at home after spring recess. For undergraduates who are on campus now, please make every effort to return home as soon as possible, and no later than Sunday, March 15. Yale College Dean Marvin Chun will be providing additional details in the coming days. Undergraduates will have the support of the university in meeting their academic requirements remotely while at home. I understand that some undergraduates consider New Haven to be their home or cannot leave the university at this time. The Yale College Dean’s Office will provide separate instructions for these students, who also will take their classes online.

Graduate and professional students are encouraged to remain off-campus and participate in online instruction, unless required to be on campus due to the nature of their research or academic programs. More information is forthcoming from the deans of each school.

The university will remain open and continue to provide custodial and limited dining services.

I hope you guys are all safe and having some good ""home-office"" time. I am writing to you to ask for your kind advice. I would really appreciate your help!  


I was recently admitted to the MA in Global Affairs at Jackson Institute, Yale and the MPA in Development Practice at SIPA, Columbia. I am an international student, with big dreams to pursue a career in international development. While both schools gave me really generous offers, and I feel so privileged to have to choose between both, after really not being able to be in a position of choice for all my life. However, I am really in need of communicating my fears.  


\- I feel like while Jackson institute could be great for an American student who wants to proceed in diplomacy and work in the state department, for example, it would still not be as efficient as SIPA for an international student. Am I wrong in this assumption?  


\- Do you think that Jackson would offer sufficient practical experience or would it be more theory-based? Do you think that an MA in Global Affairs can still boost someone's career in International Development vs Diplomacy?   


\- New Haven vs New York: when it comes to networking, and finding internships?   


\- Can I  get IT, Cyber Security, Big Data Analysis, or more practical ID skills at Yale vs SIPA?  


I would really appreciate your answers and advice!",0.1841750841750842,0.28644781144781145,Yale

The reason I don't want to live in my college is that over the past year, having Yale dominate every single aspect of my life has been incredibly stressful and unpleasant. Everyday I wake up in Yale housing and eat Yale food with people Yale has artificially forced me to spend time with, and I can't escape this academic pressure cooker long enough to relax. I was actually glad when the school announced it would close for the semester as I can now have, what is for me, a healthily distant relationship to the university.

30,Biochem Tutoring Today,1,2020-03-15 19:30:41,0,"Biochem Help?

I have a problem set due at 6pm that's released at 3pm PST. If someone is good at the CMP regulation, please pm/email me at [biochemtutoring123@gmail.com](mailto:biochemtutoring123@gmail.com). I can pay you very well. One example question we were given is about what will happen to the CMP in biosynthetic conditions?

The  answer we were given is here: We are in biosynthetic conditions. This  means we are using something smaller (in this case citrate) and using  that to build something larger (in this case fatty acids). For  biosynthetic conditions to even be active it implies we have a much  higher amount of ATP because ATP positively regulates biosynthetic  pathways. Since we have high ATP that means have a lot of our products  for the ETC and therefore ATP synthase will get inhibited. If we inhibit  ATP synthase this means that we have nothing to dissipate our pH  gradient and therefore it will become too unfavorable for the ETC to  continue to pump protons against its concentration gradient and  therefore the ETC also will shutdown. This will then cause a build-up of  the substrates of the ETC, one of which is NADH. Now, that you have  high amounts of NADH and ATP, they will together go and inhibit the  irreversible steps of the TCA cycle.However, this is where it gets a bit  complicated and why you need to remember the bigger picture (and this  will answer your second question). Yes, NADH and ATP will both inhibit  the irreversible steps of the TCA as well as ATP inhibiting both PFK and  PK in glycolysis. However, remember that you are also removing citrate  to produce fatty acids. Even though citrate synthase is being inhibited  by NADH and ATP, if we keep removing citrate you would eventually get to  a really really low concentration of citrate and therefore it will pull  forward that reaction even though citrate synthase is also being  inhibited (remember our bigger picture is that we need to keep being  able to produce citrate to remove it to make fatty acids so that's what  is happening here as well). Same thing happens for glycolysis. Since we  keep removing acetyl-CoA to make citrate, and pyruvate to make  acetyl-coA, and so on, the rest of glycolysis will also be pulled  forward even though we are inhibiting many of its enzymes. So there  wouldn't be an accumulation of glycolytic intermediates again because  they are being broken down to form more citrate so we can ultimately  make more fatty acids.",0.058643845866068085,0.47553123830901617,Yale

33,Forced shutdown of basic research labs at Yale Medical school except virology and covid19,2,2020-03-17 00:02:57,13,"March 16, 2020

Dear YSM Faculty:

In follow-up to recent communications from President Salovey, Provost Strobel, and me, basic science chairs and directors convened today to discuss the meaning of critical or essential work in the laboratory setting. As the situation on-the-ground around COVID evolves, so must our definition of critical and essential functions in the laboratory.

As always, the safety and well-being of our students, faculty, staff, and patients are our priority.

At this time, examples of critical laboratory work include research on the causes and mechanisms of viral (COVID-19) infection; therapeutic clinical research studies; monitoring of the safety and efficacy of patients in ongoing clinical trials; testing of patient/research samples for ongoing clinical trials that cannot be paused; and other lab work that impacts the immediate safety and health of our patients and community. Preservation of precious resources such as cell lines or animals so as to avoid the disruption of months or years of work may also be viewed as critical, in which case specific team members should be identified to maintain these resources and complete critical experiments.

Investigators or lab members should not come to work if they are having symptoms, and all should practice social distancing. It is important to note that investigators can be very productive while working from home. Some have expressed concerns about the impact of decreased productivity on their life’s work and career development; please know that the university and YSM will be developing a policy to extend the tenure clock commensurate with the duration of interruptions.

More detailed information regarding human subjects research can be viewed here.

I was recently admitted to Yale (a dream come true), and I was hoping to get some advice about choosing which school to attend next fall between Stanford, Harvard, and Yale. If anyone here chose Yale over Harvard/Stanford, I would really love to hear what made you choose Yale.

I think I want to study EP&amp;E. Since these schools are relatively similar in academics, I was also hoping to hear about the social scene/community. Do you find Yale to be more collaborative or competitive than H/S?

Last, I'm from New York, so I wouldn't really get to visit home from Palo Alto except on long breaks. I don't think this is that much of a big deal for me personally, but my mom would rather I be closer to home, so Yale definitely wins in that regard.

235,"An interesting read, thoughts appreciated!",1,2020-04-25 06:57:01,4,"I stumbled upon this article, and it really has challenged the way I view Yale/ similar Ivy Institutions. (Article linked below). 

My thoughts:

I know this experience isn’t unique to Yale (and most 
certainly is true at other institutions). Furthermore, I know that Yale offers world-class opportunities and resources quite unparalleled anywhere else. However, that being said, this article really has reaffirmed that Yale/Harvard/Ivies are really just a brand and a business, concerned about their public image (arguably) more so than the educational and intellectual growth of the student. 


Any of your thoughts welcome! I’m curious as to what everyone else thinks.

236,Yale vs MIT: where do you think I would fit the best?,1,2020-04-25 12:20:49,1,"So  I already made a post about this before, but I felt like I needed the input of others before I make a decision. I was admitted to Columbia,  Princeton, Yale, and MIT, and I am intending to study computer science and economics. While this post is mainly meant for Yale and MIT, I am still considering the others if you think one of them fits me more.

I'm aware that these are both incredible institutions, so if you guys know these universities, I would love it if you advised me mainly based on  fit and the perceived culture on campus.

Here are a few things about me:

\-  I'm pretty academically well-rounded. I like math and science, but I  also LOVE the humanities. I enjoy writing essays where there is no wrong answer as long as it's backed up by strong arguments.

\- My fascination with technology mainly comes from the things you can do with it (i.e. application)

\-  I feel that my main strengths are in speech and debate (did a lot of  MUN in HS). I am pretty politically engaged, and I would love to be in a  campus that is similar.

\-I am not  sure that computer science is my life's passion with ultimate  certainty, and later down the road, I would much rather have an  executive/leadership role in a company than be a software engineer

\-  I am also a big fan of entrepreneurship, business, and economics, and would love to take these as either a joint or secondary major. I am interested in startups and would love to start one in college.

\-I am interested in a more collaborative atmosphere, rather than one that has toxic competition

\-I  am an extrovert- my favorite activities to do on a weekend are social. I  typically go out to town or party, but I am also interested in doing similar social things on campus.

\-I  would personally prefer an urban environment like that of MIT or  Columbia rather than a suburban/smaller urban one like Yale or Princeton

\-  I'm also scared that the academic rigor of an institution like MIT will  make me hate my major more than an institution like Yale, especially since I see myself much more as a founder/CEO with a tech background,  rather than a software engineer.

Also  as an aside, I still haven't received my financial aid package from  Yale. Do you guys think I should request an extension since I am seriously considering it?",0.1537222222222222,0.46388888888888885,Yale

I cannot seem to find any other source that would contain my required data on Japanese import and export composition and volume.

But my unsolicited advice for you: unless you have some urgent personal reason you must start college this fall (outside scholarship that expires and can't be extended or something), take a gap year, and come in fall 2021.

There is a good chance that there won't be in-person classes in the fall. Nobody knows for sure, but it's pretty likely at this point and departments are preparing for it. Don't waste your tuition money on really overpriced webinars from Yale. Wait a year to come, and then get four full years of Yale. In addition, then you have a better chance of graduating into an economy that is one additional year away from this mess, which will probably better for your job prospects when you graduate.

I know you're excited about Yale, so the idea of sitting around at home even longer sounds shitty, but if you're gonna sit around at home next fall, you might as well not have it count against your four years at Yale.",0.2,0.46759259259259256,Yale

I’m hoping to do a phd after undergrad, and am especially interested in QFT and string theory. I recently noticed that Yale doesn’t really have any relativity (only intro to special in 410, and no general) courses for undergrads. MIT + other schools seem to have a general relativity, as well as an intro to string theory, course for undergrads, and I was wondering if entering grad school without these would be an issue. 

Should I consider ditching the double major and trying to take grad-level physics courses to make up? Is this fairly accessible and/or commonly done? 

On the other hand, I’ve heard many math classes - complex analysis, topology, differential geometry, partial diffeqs, Lie groups, functional analysis - are recommended/essential for theoretical physics. I’m also curious about the “math for physics” courses, could these supplement or replace any of the above to make room for grad courses?

Essentially, would I be better prepared with a slew of math courses or a few physics grad courses in areas I plan to pursue (both in addition to the intensive phys major)?

304,Columbia vs. Yale as a transfer for the arts,1,2020-05-13 01:15:04,8,"Hi,

I was accepted tonight as a transfer to Yale!! I am very excited as when I applied the first time it was my first choice. However, I feel as though my life/ priorities have changed significantly since that point in time. I spent the past year on a leave of absence from my college pursuing my professional acting and recorded music careers, which have both made me happier than I've ever been. I decided to transfer from my previous institution because there was no artistic community / available courses in acting/playwriting/recorded music, and it was too far away from LA auditions (2-2.5 hours 1 way). I was also accepted to Columbia University (a school that I have more friends at and am way more acquainted with) and am now tasked with the difficult decision between the two. If I was at Yale, would I feasibly be able to continue auditioning in NYC with my agency and not have to put my career on pause for 3 years? At Yale, would I get stronger connections/ inroads to the industry than at Columbia? Stronger training? Additionally, I've heard nothing about people at Yale pursuing a career in recorded (pop) music. Is there a community of non-classical musicians/producers on campus?  Any advice is appreciated!! If you have any insight as to Yale's integration of transfer students that would be helpful too. Thank you, and sorry for the long post. I recognize I'm in a very privileged position to be choosing between these two schools.",0.12405303030303033,0.4799242424242424,Yale

I shouldn’t be roaming this sub and getting my hopes up especially since I’m only in HS, but I hope you still entertain this post!

I know it’s a private school so the average family income is naturally high...but does this contribute to a sense of elitism in this school in any way? Or are people just generally down to earth?

Lastly, other than demographics and wealth, are there average people in the sense of intelligence? This is a really dumb question as Yale is a super competitive school that garners the best talent throughout the world, but I can’t help feeling behind in the midst of all this.  I imagine majority of the student population were either NASA interns, published research, won international competitions, or some variation of excellence in HS. Are there any “regular” (for lack of a better word) people that got into Yale?


I have a one in a million shot at this school so it probably super premature to ask these questions. I wish I could visit the school instead and experience the campus and ask these questions in person, but I’ll take this as a second choice!

I'd consider myself open minded, and believe in questioning my own and others's beliefs to arrive at the truth-- within the proper environment, of course, like a classroom or a debate, I won't go up to random people and start debating them.

So far the mods have said ""there is often a fine line between troll activities and people wanting to speak their minds, even if some of the opinions may be uncomfortable to others. It takes us time to make sure we don't carelessly censor the latter kind"" which is an easy cop out that just means ""I don't want to actually do anything about this since it means I need to put in any effort.""

There is no fine line, when people come in and say ""Yes, Cancel Yale.

Last month we released our first app, Letters, which lets users sign up, type up a letter to their incarcerated loved one (in any jail or prison in the U.S), attach a photo, and then we send it off to get printed, packaged, stamped and mailed through USPS. We're doing this at no cost. I understand deeply the financial and emotional strain that comes with keeping in touch with a loved-one on the inside. That's why we're keeping this service free and unlimited (although we are now limiting it to 3 letters a day to save money).

What's the catch? There is no catch. It's completely free. A number of generous individuals and foundations are funding our operations.

(Math, Science, Lab, English + maybe an extra interesting class) or take a CS class in replacement for the Science + Lab. Which combination of courses for my first term might you recommend?

I’ve also been told don’t take more than 4 courses your first semester so I wanted to ask about the rigor of a science + lab. From my understanding, a science course and the lab that it goes with are technically two separate courses, so would it be equally rigorous as taking 2 courses? If I choose to just take the fundamental classes, should I drop the 1 interesting class from my schedule? I know my first term I’ll not only be getting used to the rigor of Yale’s courses, but also most likely having to take them online. 

CS class wise, I’ve had decent experience with Java and Python (the latter I did way more further back so I’m v rusty in), took AP CS as well which was a pretty easy class for me. But I consider myself not that experienced with coding as a whole (I don’t really know binary trees, stacks) What CS class do you recommend taking my first term if I choose to take a CS class in replacement for a Science + Lab?",0.25000000000000006,0.4653769841269842,Yale

**I'm currently a rising sophomore at Stony Brook University majoring in computer science. When I was a senior in high school, I applied to many top schools but was rejected/wailisted despite having a 1500 SAT score, 4.0 GPA, unique essay, and dedicated extracurriculars. This led me to attend Stony brook, which was my safety school.**  


**The summer after high school graduation, I did a software engineering internship at educational technology company, where my supervisors were Yale and Columbia grads. This summer, after my freshman year of college, I am doing another software engineering internship at a technology company that focuses on maintaining digital security and fraud prevention. I am also on the executive board of Stony brook's computer science club. I attended a hackathon at Yale as well called Yhacks.**   


**However, my GPA is not that good since it's less than 3.5. I was wondering what my chances are for transferring to Cornell given the internships related to my degree, possible rec letters from supervisors, and club board member position. Also, what can I do to increase my chances of transferring and when should I apply to transfer.**

557,Not sure if I’m in the right place to ask this question but...,1,2020-08-02 19:39:30,10,"TL;DR: Do “normal” gifted students get into Yale? 

When I was in elementary school, they had us research a college and write a paper on it. My 10 year old self knew little about how to make a piece of toast without burning the house down, let alone picking a college to write about. After refusing to decide on a college for my paper, my teacher pulled me aside and told me to research Yale. The more I learned, the more I felt like I had found a potential fit. That paper sparked two things in my heart—that I loved to write, and that I desperately wanted to go to have an unmatched educational experience at Yale. I wanted to be surrounded with people who love learning and seek out knowledge the way I do. However, I was 10, and knew little, and in similar ways, still know little now.

A couple years have passed since that paper was written, and I am now freaking out.

I’ve always been academically gifted and hardworking, done well on all standardized tests, and have several hobbies that I love with all my heart, but by no means am the best at. I now have distinct subjects and classes that interest me. I absolutely adore learning. As I start to make bigger life decisions, I’m starting to realize I may have gone about this all wrong.

The more I research my college choices, the more I come across the idea that unless you are world class, or the best at something, you don’t have a chance. Obviously, this is quite disheartening and discouraging. I’ve come to the realization that I am “good” at everything, but “world class” at nothing. (For example, I’m equally good at math and english, but have no high distinctions, awards, or triumphs in either.) I know colleges aren’t expecting me to find it the cure to cancer, but am I supposed to be a national essay winner? Am I supposed to be a math olympian on a world-wide level? I know I can push myself farther. But what if farther isn’t me?

Should I spend the rest of time in high school working to be world class at something? Is it possible for me to just be myself and still make it? Am I simply going about this all wrong by working and stressing over a college that isn’t even a good fit?

I just bombed my Chinese placement test interview because I was nervous. I’ve studied Chinese for 8 or so years and can usually speak conversationally without any issue. Not this time. It now seems likely I’ll be placed down a level or two from where I would ideally be. Obviously, shopping period is meant to help rectify any placement issues—but the preregistration and placement process for languages is a bit intimidating. For my peace of mind: how easy is it to actually switch sections if the material is redundant to what you previously studied?

Yale is currently on the list of programs I'm looking at, and I wanted to get any input here about the program before applying!

I know many in CS poo-poo the idea of getting a master's degree, but for reasons I'm happy to get into if asked, I'm 99% sure that this a master's is the right next step for me.

My interests in CS lie primarily in machine learning (more because I have research experience in the field than anything else), formal methods/logic/theory, and security. If any of you are CS graduate students involved in these fields, I'd love to know your experience with the program. If not, I'd still love to hear your thoughts. 

Yale being Yale, I'm a little concerned about how master's students are treated as opposed PhD students when it comes to academic mentorship and opportunities. I've hear horror stories (not necessarily from Yale, but from similar big-name CS schools) of PhD advisors. I'm also coming from a ""no-name"" state school, and I'm a little intimated by the Ivys. Are my fears overblown?

For context, here are the other schools I'm looking at (and a fair warning, this list is way too long and part of the reason I'm looking for feedback is to help trim down this list): KTH, ETH Zurich, EPFL, Stanford, University of Michigan, CMU, Princeton, Cornell, Penn, University of Wisconsin, University of British Columbia, Oxford University, Cambridge University, Harvard University, McGill University, Kings College London.",0.19900793650793652,0.49442460317460324,Yale

I am a senior at the University of Connecticut and over the past few months my team and I along with the sociology department at UConn have been working hard to develop a workshop to help college students attain more meaningful and purposeful lives. Given the stress of COVID-19 and the lack of mental health resources available at many universities across the nation, I invite each of you to join our two day seminar and meet college students from across the nation as you develop the skills needed to live a more meaningful life. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. Posted below are more details about the seminar: 

How can one attain a meaningful life without knowing what it is that they value? 

In this webinar, we will demonstrate that many people live their lives without the framework necessary to achieve true purpose. We will help you identify a set of “core values,” and demonstrate how to live your life according to your self-identified value structure so as to realize a meaningful life.

This webinar will take place over two, 45 minute zoom meetings. You must attend the first meeting in order to join the second. In between meetings you will be given one, ten minute reflective assignment to support your growth and learning.

Meeting 1: Thursday, Sept. 24th from 5:00pm to 5:45pm

Meeting 2: Saturday, Sept. 26th from 5:00pm to 5:45pm

696,Does Yale usually expect people to sell their houses for tuition?,1,2020-09-17 23:26:26,17,"So our family falls in an income bracket of $10,000-$15,000 a year and were told by the financial office that we don't qualify for financial aid because of our assets. We have a $10,000,000 house as our primary home (in our country, housing prices are so inflated that this doesn't even count as expensive--it's literally just a 30-year-old apartment that doesn't even have proper parking spaces) that we bought in 2009 and a second property that's worth half as much. However, we use the second property as space for our family's small business, so it's basically a second primary home and not even really a source of extra income.

We were refused financial aid the first time we applied, but COVID wasn't an issue at that time so we were disappointed but not devastated.

We believe that even if we help and educate one person, the family of the patient will discover the true meaning of correct education and gain knowledge which will be passed on and on, which means essentially, educating people one at a time, once someone is educated on such topics, the family gains the same knowledge and understanding. iCure is on all six inhabited continents. We have chapters at Harvard, Yale, Brown and Northwestern. We have more chapters that are in the process of being created in other universities.

That question was dismissed by the host. At first I thought it was because someone else has asked that question, so there's a repeat so mine was dismissed for that. But it's been 25 minutes, I've asked several follow-ups phrasing it differently (e.g. inclusivity in terms of bathrooms) and those were dismissed as well. Since my question, they have not talked about LGBTQ inclusion at all (and now they're saying they're wrapping it up with a ""lightning round"" since it's nearing the end of the hour), so I don't think another student has asked the same question, and they're continuing to ask questions that've been asked more recently like 7 minutes ago or so. I don't think my question about LGBTQ inclusion will ever be answered, and I'm wondering why they don't feel okay with answering it. I don't think you have to be LGBTQ to answer this question.

Therefore, we are now looking for tutors aged 17 and up to virtually tutor these kids. As we are new, we are not able to pay our tutors just yet, but we will provide you with community service hours if you would like.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm applying to Yale for EA in a few days. I was listening to the Yale Admissions podcast and in one episode they said to not write about the death of a grandparent. That said, they also said if you focus less on the death and more about yourself, specifically by including the death at the beginning, it could be a good essay.

&amp;#x200B;

My common app is about my grandmother who passed away this summer from dementia. it is about her death, but its more so about her struggle with dementia and the affect that it had on me. In your opinions, is it fine to go through with this or should I find something else. I should also add that I feel quite strongly about this essay and it is pretty important to me, and I am proud of it.

I've been working on a small project, Schoodule, to help with my workflow for classes and coursework. 

It's a desktop website that serves as a scheduling tool specifically made for students.

This tool provides one location to view all bits of information regarding any course or event that you decide to schedule. You can store and find any:

* Links
* Emails
* Professors/TAs
* Office Hours
* Discussion/Labs
* Important Exam Dates

Each course/event also comes with an included to-do list for those who like to stay extra organized!

I've been using this tool for the last couple of weeks and I've found it very useful-- especially since classes are all online anyway. So, I decided to launch a small beta version for anyone who might be interested in Schoodule.

You can access it at myschoodule.com!Also, if you have any feedback or ideas for improvement, feel free to send it through the feedback section of the website! :)

870,"Student lying to financial aid to essentially get ""free"" tuition",1,2020-11-27 08:28:03,15,"Made a throwaway account to post this, seeking advice.

My son is a student at Yale who originally planned to study aboard this semester.  Surprisingly, considering the pandemic, it seemed like he was still going to be able to study aboard till it got cancelled in the summer and my son was forced to find a roommate.

Before coming home for break my son checked the mail at school and was giving his roommates their mail and took the rest of the mail home, presumably all his mail.  He wasn't paying attention to the mail, he was watching TV and opening the mail today and noticed a tuition stub for his roommate.  \~$37k tuition, \~$36k in ""needs based"" scholarship from the school, and an ending balance of \~$1k. 

I've met this roommate's parents during move in and they introduced themselves as doctors.....something isn't adding up here.

I had the roommate's dad's name and they live in a small city in the mid west, I was able to find him on his hospital's webpage.  Picture of the website is the exact guy I met, can confirm he really is a doctor.  Google says average salary for his specialty is $320k/yr.  Roommate's mom does show a doctor in the same small city, the years of experience adds up, but I didn't find a picture to confirm it with.  Had the roomate's address from something, zillow.com's ""zestimate"" as a $1.6M house.

Going back to the question:  why the HELL does this roommate have a needs based scholarship to where he's paying just over $1k a semester??

Asked my son about the roommate, he at first said he's never had a problem with him, then he says he doesn't really know him and seems like he's a loner that just wants to be left alone.  Then my son admits he didn't spend much time with him and was essentially living with his girlfriend....I guess that's another story for another day.

&amp;#x200B;

I plan on contacting the school regarding this.  It's not fair for other student's like my son, who is forced to get loans.  I don't have the roommate's financial records, so I'm not going to make any claims, but I will raise my concern and obviously ask the school to take a deeper look at this.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post, I'm a little shocked and appalled.

I suffer from PTSD and severe chronic depression. I have my whole life. I made it through my Bachelor's in chemistry anyway with near perfect grades, worked as a chemist for years after, and my hard work landed me at Yale for graduate school. However, these events unfolded:

When I arrived, they refused to give me a therapist unless I switched my psychiatrist to their student health office - they then did not assign me a therapist or a psychiatrist for 6 months, meaning I had to stop my medications and had no one to help me manage them;

They only gave me doctors after I called them three separate times for traumatic events happening in my life (I was stalked, harassed, and physically strangled - and they sent me to the LAW SCHOOL FOR HELP instead of the trauma center, and i was ignored);

Their doctors then refused to give me medications, telling me I am too hard to treat and they don't think I can be helped;

I then suffered yet another traumatic event, and was hospitalized for suicidal ideation - Yale then HELD me against my will at the hospital, saying that they refused to release me until they assessed me, then took 7 days to show up causing me to miss the first two weeks of classes;

My advisor then fired me from the lab, saying he did not want to work with someone that was hospitalized, and this was after he advised me to take mostly his classes, leaving me with very few connections - he also informed me it was not his job to care about my career or my degree;

They then forced me to change my major out of science - and I have been a scientist my whole life. In between all of this, the dean misguided me and told me NOT to register with the disability office because graduate students should be talking to the academic affairs office.

936,Strength of STEM at Yale,1,2020-12-21 04:32:53,9,"Hey! I was admitted to Yale REA (ahh, yay!) and based on my knowledge of the place from my college visits two summers ago and my research, it was my top choice. I really love what I can tell about the community, etc, and part of me wants to stop applying to other colleges and commit.

The financial aid was great, so that’s not a concern. My family wants me to commit as well.

The “problem” (extremely good problem to have, I almost feel bad even worrying about an acceptance to YALE) is that I’m a STEM student. I don’t really know what I wanna do with my life, but I’ve gone to a STEM high school and that is more than likely what I’ll end up majoring in. I do have interests outside of math/science, and loved the idea of getting to know a variety of people in Yale residential colleges and having a liberal arts education. However, everything I’ve read says Yale isn’t that strong in STEM. 

I know at this caliber (for undergrad especially?) the distinctions of the relative strengths of the fields aren’t THAT relevant, but I keep feeling like I might be shooting myself in the foot not trying for Stanford and Princeton (as a potential engineering student) even though I like Yale more... do any STEM students at Yale have something to say about the strength of stem, why you chose Yale as a stem student, etc? Also, how are the graduate school prospects in STEM from Yale, as compared to a more heavily STEM school? 

Again, I know this is dumb. Yale is amazing, fit is the most important thing, etc, etc, I’m just stressed about it and would love to hear from Yalies in this kind of situation. 

Tl;dr I got accepted to Yale and want to commit but I’m worried about the relative strength of stem/engineering and wondering if I should apply elsewhere as well",0.2546236559139785,0.5391935483870968,Yale

956,A few questions about Yale before committing.,1,2020-12-23 01:55:04,37,"TLDR: Admitted to Yale and had three major questions. 

* STEM majors, how has it been learning at a school that's know for focusing on humanities?
* How has your experience in the New Haven area been? 
* Is there a ""superiority"" complex among students with regards to Harvard? That's the vibe I've gotten from admitted students chats so far.

Hey everyone! I was accepted to Yale REA and think I'll commit soon. It's my dream school and I can't see myself anywhere else. But, I wanted to see if anyone on this sub could help inform me before I make a final decision. 

Firstly, I'm not 100% sure what I'm going to major in, but I know it will be in either chemistry or biology. As of now, I'm probably doing Molecular Biophysics &amp; Biochemistry. But, I have no clue what I want to do as a career, and wouldn't be surprised if I decided to switch to an Econ or Data Science/Stats major. The thing I liked about Yale was the ability to easily switch majors, I know some schools are tough since you have to transfer between colleges, but that's not the case at Yale.

Yale is also a very humanities-heavy school, but from what I've read, it's been pouring A LOT into improving its STEM programs. I don't see this as a large issue, since I enjoy humanities as much as STEM, just can't see myself majoring in anything non-STEM. The reason I didn't apply to a school like MIT is b/c I value the importance of a liberal arts education that Yale provides. Yale seems like a great school for general science (biology, physics, chem, etc. which I hope to do). It also seems like there are endless opportunities for research which interest me as well. Could anyone that's majoring in STEM talk about their experiences? 

Finally, more general stuff. How's New Haven? Do you find yourself stuck in a ""Yale bubble"" or do you get the chance to explore? Do you connect with students from surrounding colleges at all?",0.16060684484597526,0.6011544011544012,Yale

1083,Questions about Yale sophomore transfer,1,2021-01-28 20:21:38,12,"Hi, I'm a current sophomore at a T30 school and I am looking to transfer to Yale. I recognize that transferring as a junior is incredibly difficult, but I would really love to attend.

I know that Yale prefers nontraditional students or legacies--both of which I wouldn't fall under the category of. I have a good college GPA as well as good extracurriculars (several jobs &amp; arts accomplishments), but I performed poorly my senior year of high school and have a subpar HS GPA. I also applied to Yale previously. Are there any ""traditional"" transfer students here that can give any advice about transferring? Also, due to the pandemic/people taking gap years would there perhaps be a greater acceptance rate than previous years? Thank you in advance!",0.08923076923076922,0.4844871794871795,Yale

1085,Freshman Courseload for Spring: Thoughts?,1,2021-01-29 03:35:15,8,"Looking at taking these classes in the spring:

* ASTR 030: Search for Extraterrestrial Life (FYS)
* ECON 116: Introductory Macroeconomics
* ECON 159: Game Theory (with Polak)
* ENAS 151: Multivariable Calculus for Engineers

Also, I'm considering either S&amp;DS 100 or S&amp;DS 123 as a fifth credit. S&amp;DS 100 would definitely be a lighter workload and I probably wouldn't have to worry about dropping, but the material for S&amp;DS 123 interests me more and the workload is definitely higher, which means there's a higher chance I'll end up dropping it. Since dropping courses is much easier than adding later in the semester, what would y'all suggest I do? Would appreciate any advice + tips if anyone has taken these classes before!",0.1142857142857143,0.37142857142857144,Yale
