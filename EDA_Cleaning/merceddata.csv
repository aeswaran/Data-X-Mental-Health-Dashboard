GPA (unweighted) : 3.90, GPA weighted: 4.50, SAT: 1470 

So I'm a decent-ish student and I applied to all the UC's and got into all of them except for Berkeley and UCLA, and got waitlisted for Davis which makes sense because for the past 4 years I've only focused on medical so I had no computer science experience whatsoever when I applied. I wanna stay in NorthCal (I'm from Bay Area). Right now, **I wanna decide between Merced and Santa Cruz just in case I don't get into Davis.** 

I wanna go to graduate school for sure so I wanna spend most of the next 4 years getting as many experiences and internships as possible so I wanna go to a university with opportunities. I'm also an outgoing student so I'm willing to go out of my way to get them, but it would be nice to go to a uni with connections. I also think that going to a smaller and less competitive university such as Santa Cruz and Merced would make it easier for me to stand out amongst my peers.  

I've also thought about double majoring in either biology or business. I'm not too sure about any of that right now, but that's also in the back of my mind when making this decision. 

And that's pretty much it about me. I know this post was all over the place (essentially just a brain vomit) but taking all of this into account, **which UC would you guys prefer: UCSC or UCM?**

What are my housing options and what are the pros and cons of choosing the different types?

My intended major is Psychology, but I might switch to something else, is that a good idea(very open to ideas), or should I stick with it?

The security payment is due at the same time as the decision deadline right? (May 1st)

Is the meal plan useful or should I stick with making meals for myself a lot? 

Is it easy to make friends? I don't know anyone going so I'm hoping I can just make friends easily. 

I tried to find a way to contact them, and the Student First Center was the only thing I could find. I asked a question and it took a bit to respond but the response looked very automated and didn't feel like a real person. Is there a place I can contact someone real... that would be able to help me with making sure I've turned everything in and not missing anything? 

Would it be smart to bring my bike with me? I also have a car so is there a rule for not parking on campus for freshman or something along those lines? Skateboard maybe? 

This one may sound really dumb, but do I choose my own classes? No one in my family went to college so they aren't helpful, but do I make my own classes or is it like high school where they choose my classes for me based on my major? 

Do I have to deny all my other colleges or can I just accept Merced and not respond to the others?

When do I apply for housing? I see that the deadline for continuing students is soon, but when do I apply for my own housing (incoming freshman)?

I'll try to think of more questions but these are the general ones I've thought of for now. Hopefully I can get some responses. Thank you. Also sorry if my English is bad, not first language but I think I'm doing better :)",0.15390243902439024,0.5387998451413085,merced

It doesn't seem like UC Merced is much of a party school, and I'm honestly fine with it. But, is being in UC Merced a viable place to hang out with a group of friends and is traveling to the town nearby fun or at least a decent place to go to on weekends. 

Another thing is the kitchen use. I know UCM has trash food and honestly I was gonna cook for myself anyways 99% of the time. So how's the kitchen situation looking like on average? I presume I have to provide the food to cook myself but is the equipment good for using daily and is it available almost daily. If not, is there a microwave available and are we able to bring our own if needed.

I also want to use the weightlifting gym as much as possible, how is the equipment there? Is it mostly machines or are there freeweight sections for deadlift, squat, and bench? Also is it empty most of the time or is it pretty stacked throughout the day.

I'm a pretty decent student and if I really put my mind into it, I can do really well in my academics. I want to go to grad school in the future and currently **majoring in compsci** and maybe either double majoring or minoring in economics. 

I was originally wait-listed for Davis and in the mean time I committed to Merced. Over the past month, I've gotten more and more excited to go to merced because it has more opportunities, funding, and it's a smaller school so more chances to get to know professors. All of what it offers (despite not being so well known) is really attracting for me.

However, I just got off the wait list for Davis and now I'm really **confused** on what to do and I have only a few days left to decide. Davis is more well known but also competitive. Merced is lesser known but has more opportunities. Grad school has always been a dream of mine so I want to go to an undergraduate school that prepares me well for that.

So, any advice? UC Davis or UC Merced?

We have experience with careers in the medical field, engineering, anthro, etc. Email us at [adviceclass@gmail.com](mailto:adviceclass@gmail.com) if you are interested in receiving a course plan and advice from us.

I have made a post on the merced thread before and everyone was super nice and helpful so I am hoping to get some help again ! I am still in high school and will be an incoming senior, and would like to create a website where other high school students can voice their opinion anonymously (or if they want they can put their name). This can be like a safe space where it can help other students facing a problem or going through anything and for them not to feel judged when voicing their own opinions. Ive seen as a high schooler people tend to lean towards the majority because they are scared just just shy but this would be a place for them to share their thoughts and troubles and for other people who want to be genuinely nice, to show that there is good in the world. This is the basic idea but im still stuck on a name, and am open to all other ideas that you guys have :)",0.2037254901960784,0.5889215686274509,merced

Hello everyone,

I am a college student and I know the feeling that high schoolers get when they are seniors. High school seniors feel overwhelmed and anxious about the college process. From deciding what schools to apply, starting the applications, and deciding what school to go to. I always wanted to start a mentorship program to help seniors through that process. My goal and plan is to create College Bound Mentorship and help around 50 seniors by pairing them up with a college student. The pairing will allow seniors to start connections with college students as well as to have someone who they will be able to  seek when they have questions. I know that my idea is still up in the air but It  wouldn't  be possible  to start it if I do not have Mentors to help out. Please fill out this google form if you are interested in helping out.

I am working with a couple of my friends to design an app that makes the process of meeting new people easier. It is so hard for UC Merced students to find new friends or meet new people despite our large student body especially NOW. We want people to meet that new person who they vibe with or can attend events like concerts with. We have a quick survey that will take only a couple of minutes max for us to have a better idea of matching people. We have already developed a matching algorithm but we want to finalize our profile. We have read countless papers on friendship chemistry and realized personality and having similar morals/values are super important. However, we want to further refine our profile and take any additional recommendations. Dm me if you have any questions.

My team and I are currently working on an app that makes the process of meeting new people easier for students during the pandemic. We want to have people meet that new person who they can vibe and talk to during in spite of online courses. With the help of 500 user responses and several psychology papers, we created a unique profile outline that should match people based on the most important traits. We have deployed a website to gather actual user responses to match and are trying to test and validate our matching algorithm and require people to help us by reviewing their matches. By no means, is our algorithm final and we would love people who are honest and willing to help us out. To make our app a safer place we are restricting it to only college student so we **require .edu emails.**

241,A PSA to UCM students from the Berkeley community,1,2020-09-14 14:01:46,11,"Recently some news was shared to our subreddit outlining a dismissive and disrespectful act that, often, many non-Berkeley students are guilty of.

Please do not refer to Berkeley as “#2 Public University.” This is not the proper way to refer to the University of California's original and flagship campus. #1, The Best, or The GOAT are all proper and acceptable ways to say it. #2, on the other hand, is not.

As the system's most prestigious and respected campus, we feel that it is important to honor and maintain an appropriate level of respect for our university's ranking. We feel that ""#2"" cheapens our brand and doesn't emphasize the incredible prestige associated with Berkeley.

While it may be acceptable to refer to all other UC campuses in lower ranks due to their lack of recognition and prestige, this is not acceptable for the flagship and most well-known campus, and we therefore request that you cease using the name ""#2"" to refer to our school.

Thank you.

Don't say ""#2"" when referring to Berkeley.",0.2375,0.4744791666666667,merced
