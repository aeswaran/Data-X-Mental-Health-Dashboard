I received an email from UCSD Housing Contracts, and in it, it mentioned that I was going to receive  a ""VA housing stipend"" at the end of the month (presumably September). I researched the term and it seems to apply to veterans, but that would be weird since I never put that any of my family members are serving/served in the military, so maybe it stands for something else? 

Also I have accepted the unsubsidized loan (way before deadlines), signed the promissory note (right after it was available), but on TritonLink&gt;Billing and Payment&gt;Current Account History&gt;Pending Awards I don't see my unsubsidized loan. Every other financial aid award/loan is already there, maybe it disburse at a later date? Is there a step/form I am missing? I found [this form](http://faoforms.ucsd.edu/forms/9DLUNSUB_TritonLink.pdf), but it just seems redundant for me to sign it considering I completed the promissory, and I don't want to accidentally borrow more loans. I would be nearly 1K short if I don't get my unsubsidized loan in time. 

TDLR: What does ""VA"" stand for in relation to UCSD? Does direct unsubsidized loans release at a later time than other awards, or am I missing a step?"

This is the link I found and they don't answer my questions:  [https://app.joinhandshake.com/career\_fairs/11667](https://app.joinhandshake.com/career_fairs/11667) 

Why does it have two additional times listed there, if it already says it will run from 9 am to 9 pm?

Do I need to actually wear formal attire there, as though it were a job interview, or will my everyday T-shirt and jeans suffice?

I need to bring a resume?? How many?? If I don't have any job experience whatsoever, can I just put down the volunteer work I did? Will not having any job experience make me look bad? 

And I need to make up a pitch? I thought it was the job recruiters talking to US, not the other way around. How do I do that and what do I say?

And should I get up at like 7 am so I can be near the front of the line?

What's my percent chance of getting a job if I am shy and socially awkward and it shows?"

I couldn’t seem to find a topic anywhere regarding my situation. UCSD is pulling a large portion of my FA because I had exceeded the maximum amount of quarters. 

I was not aware as I had thought Summer Sessions 1 and 2 = 1 quarter. 🤦‍♀️ I had also studied abroad for a month during the summer, and the FA office is stating that is 2 quarters as well. 

So even though Summer Session 1 and 2 May equal to 8-12 units, is it still considered 2 quarters?

At the end of this whole ordeal, we didn't get everything we wanted, but I would say what we did get is a fair compromise. I understand the Department has funding constraints, so I am thankful students were essentially able to retain free weekend parking for half of the school year (and the entire school year in one parking lot). 

Thank you to everyone for helping us get to this point. Again, while we did not get back free weekend parking in its entirety, we still retained much of what we otherwise would have lost. I've submitted an Op-Ed to the Triton outlining my overall feelings on this, which I'll be pasting in below. It's a bit of a long read (650 words), but kind of sums up my lingering misgivings about this whole process. All things considered, however, I am happy that we were able to make it to this point. Thanks again to everyone who stood together on this issue! You are all amazing.

Here's the Op-Ed in its entirety (for those interested):

As many students are acutely aware, the Transportation Department intended to make big changes to weekend parking rates this coming school year; initially, in order to park on-campus during the weekends, the Department planned to charge a fee to students and visitors alike. After enormous pushback from the student body and the San Diego community in general, the idea was revisited, but this time with the intention of including student leaders in the conversation.

After countless hours of work put in between the Student Transportation Advisory Committee (STAC), Associated Students (AS), and Transportation Director Josh Kavanaugh, four alternatives were presented to the student body for a vote. As of September 3rd, Alternative B was chosen, which would provide the following:

1. Weekend Parking Fees will be implemented, sans Lot P782

2. The first hour of weekend parking will be free in all lots

3. Permit upgrade hours will now extend to the weekends

4. Students will receive ten complimentary 1-day Weekend Parking Passes per quarter

5. Additional 1-day Weekend Parking Passes may be purchased

6. This plan will go into effect on Saturday, November 2nd.

As this parking discussion comes to a close, students have a lot to be proud of: first and most importantly, when both the graduate and undergraduate community identified this issue as important, we came together and pushed back against what we viewed as bad policy; second, while we did not gain everything we had hoped, we are walking away from this fight with far more than we would have if we did not otherwise engage with the administration. This saga should serve as a lesson to us all that when we take issues seriously, and when we stand together with one voice, we can bring about real change on this campus.

With all that being said, there is one important question left to be answered, and the ball is firmly in the court of the Transportation Department to answer it: despite the concessions made in favor of the student body with Alternative B, are these increased fees still necessary? After attending the July STAC meeting, the Department made it clear that its deficit payments will be increasing to 18 billion dollars annually in just a few short years, and that these increased fees are necessary to offset these costs (which are being incurred in order to fund additional parking structures and the like). This data point is valid and important, but most likely does not tell the entire story. In order to see a more full picture, I have asked the Transportation Department to provide the public with the following financial information: 

1. Current cash on hand

2. Last 5 years of revenues

3. Projected revenues under the new parking proposals

4. Projected revenues without weekend parking fees

5. Current revenue streams

6. Current pay structure

With this information, coupled with the debt payment structures provided at that July STAC meeting, I believe the student body will finally be able to ascertain the true gravity of the situation. Is it possible that these weekend parking changes are in fact necessary, given the reality that the Department is bound by law to raise revenue strictly from transportation fees? Absolutely. That being said, I think it is in both the Department and the student body’s best interest to have the aforementioned information released to the public. In the former’s case, full transparency can be claimed, and in the latter’s case, students can appropriately analyze the situation at hand, along with all of its details.

Overall, I am happy that the concerns of the student body were taken into account, and a conversation around the issue was able to be had. Compromise is important on issues such as these, and by standing up for ourselves, we gained back much of what we were poised to lose. I am thankful that everyone involved in this process (STAC, AS, the Transportation Department, Director Kavanaugh, and others) brought us into the conversation and heard what we had to say."

I know this question get asked a lot, and I just want some confirmation. Currently, my financial aid covers all of my tuition. However, since I am new student my balance is around $300 because of newly admitted fees and UCSHIP. As a result, I am gonna have to pay for this with the assets I have right now. My parents have a health insurance plan, so I might be able to waive it but the coverage is garbage (had to pay out of pocket for lots of things because my insurance didn't cover it. Now here is what I want confirmation on.

If I decide to waive UCSHIP (assuming I have full financial aid), then do I get the $680 back through a direct deposit? OR does the school remove the UCSHIP fee from my balance, and give me the negative balance through a direct deposit (current balance = $300 so $380 through a direct deposit)

If I either decide to accept UCSHIP or get my waiver denied, then does UCSD give me the UCSD grant of $680 in late OCT? Do I have to sign up for the UCSD grant or does the financial aid know that I automatically qualify it? Is the UCSD grant a direct deposit also? Do I have to pay for UCSHIP every quarter? 

I know I am probably going have to eat through my savings account for things like Iclickers, so I need to know how this works lol.

Thank you

Sorry for asking this question =(. I tired emailing the FA office, but they never reply."

Also, are the numbers in the criteria is that of the family's income, or of its assets; If it is the assets, I want to know if that includes savings of the family. I'm also curious as the financial need that is subtracted from our family's contribution is the ""grant,"" because my dad was infuriated because it was labeled as a ""direct subsidized loan"", and he asserted it's not truly a grant/free money if it was a loan."

If you're looking for a fun org to join this year, check out Triton Robosub. We build AUVs and compete in an international robotics competition every summer here in San Diego! This will be our second year, so there's a lot of new stuff to be working on. Some of the things we'll be doing this year are:

* Tackling a design project from the Navy
* Designing, building and testing a brand new sub
* Integrating hydrophones and underwater acoustics
* Building custom boards
* Machine Learning-aided computer vision
* Community outreach
* A journal paper, to be published after the competition

All of this is on top of the opportunity to get in contact with our sponsors in industry, tour local companies' facilities, and meet recruiters. The experience is super fun, and we're not just looking for engineers! If anyone is interested in finance, business, social media, or outreach, we're looking to fill those roles as well!

If you don't have any experience, that's okay. We're looking for passionate people who are willing to put in time, because we have plenty of faculty and industry mentors who can teach.

If you have any questions, feel free to message me, email us at robosub@ucsd.edu, or check out or website at https://robosub.ucsd.edu.

For those of you not on Facebook, I've been combining several year's worth of student guides as a way to not study for the GRE.  If there's any topics you'd like to be covered that you don't see headers for already, please comment them down below. Also, if you're a current student and have some information/tips you'd like to share, please DM me and I'll add that to the appropriate section, while giving you credit! 

If you have any questions, by some miracle of god or an accounting fluke, I'm a fourth-year nanoengineer in Revelle college. I'm on the board of a few different clubs, have written grants to try and get us chickens (to which I have somewhat succeeded - 7 is more than 0), and am an SD native so if you have any questions on what to do during move-in weekend, I can try to help (if I'm not GRE braindead).

So I am currently enrolled at UCSD for a 2023 graduation year (haven't even started my first semester). My parents have given me (under an agreement I never really agreed to) $150,000 for school. Now this may seem like a shit-ton of money, however out-of-state tuition at UCSD is approx $47k/year + $15k for first year room and board. Rent and living expenses should equal to around the same $15k/year, which leaves the total cost of living at UCSD $60k++, which will probably leave me out of money after my second year.

What would be the main ways I could find solutions to help pay for college? I submitted my FAFSA late this year and due to my parents financial situation (my father is rather well-off), it is difficult to receive grants through FAFSA. This being the case, although I am not receiving direct aid from his part and I actually need the money... I will definitely file another FAFSA next year but I don't know my chances to receive aid. If anyone's received aid from FAFSA, please tell me how and how much! :) I have also been looking at Fastweb scholarships but there are so many and everything seems very fishy and I haven't had luck with that. I am also a permanent resident of the US (eligible for federal grants) but I have an extremely international background and can qualify for international scholarships if needed.

After the first round of Immunization history back in July, I got some messages saying I had some issues with a few. No problem I thought, I'll just go in and get the doses I need. However, my doctor said that two were likely in error because of my time abroad as a child: My Varicella and MMR vaccines. They gave me the one dose they thought I needed and a letter saying that they could vouch for my immunity. The school did not accept the letter, and recommended that I go back and get a blood titer for MMR and Varicella. So I set up another appointment a week later, go in, get my blood drawn, and await results. I got what I was expecting for MMR, immune, but for Varicella, I was notified that I was not, in fact, immune like I was told. Once again I thought that I would just make another appointment and squeeze it in just before the due date. Except that you need two doses 20 days apart. Which means my second dose will be passed the deadline. So I guess my question is will they be ok if I upload proof I am undergoing inoculation? Or will I be penalized in some way?

2. If there is reading material, read it before the lesson of that material
3. If professors lecture in a certain outline, take notes in the same way
4. After each class, clean up notes + identify things that were not understood
   1. – take these things to office hours / discussions
   2. – combine lecture notes with reading notes
5. Review notes before a discussion class
6. Keep all loose paper from a class in class folder
7. Turn off phone while studying or keep it away
8. Before a party, Netflix, or any distraction be completely done with school work for the day
9. Sleep at least 6h a night and maintain sleep schedule consistent

I'm a student diagnosed (at a young age) with ADHD and I have received accommodations at my previous schools. I submitted documents and met with XXXX (I do not know if I'm allowed to state the name of the specialist) at the initial intake appointment and was stated I can get accommodations on a provisional basis. After that, I tried contacting her several times (since mid-august) even dropped in at the OSD office several days but no response. The front desk and call answering people kept telling me I cannot meet until after Sept 2nd week. I explained to them several times the summer class is over by that time and why would I need to meet then. 

My final attempt of trying to contact: I dropped into the office still not allowed to meet so I called after one-hour, same response then called again after 3-4 hours (a different person answered) started giving me the same typical story you have to make an appointment bla bla... and I responded back saying you guys keep saying you don't have appointments then how can i meet..... I finally said a bit angrily I need you to transfer me to this person and the person on the line responded back saying she is busy and I told the girl on the phone tell her that I'm calling regarding a summer class and that I need a response. 

She took my name and then finally transferred and here she responds to me I will submit docs to the committee but I cannot guarantee you will get any accommodations (My first thought: was she thinking I gave docs for her to hold on to them or something and what the hell was she doing without submitting docs to committee all this time). She responds to me that my documents are years old (All medical docs submitted were within the last 10 months). I had patience and asked her can you proceed with the current school accommodations letter and the submitted docs and then within 2days I was approved minimum accommodations and she itself told to me meet a different specialist (IDK why).

Long story short: I completely felt like she completely ignored (neglected needs) me on purpose but IDK if that's how the OSD office at UCSD works since this was my first time interacting with the office. I honestly feel bad for those students that cannot get services even with documented disabilities since they have to go through specialists like her.  

OSD office at UCSD should have a better screening process when hiring specialists like her and higher-ups need to stop acting like you don't know/ see these.

Thanks to how National Merit Scholars don't get priority enrollment anymore and how WebReg crashed 30 mins before I was supposed to enroll, (meaning I had to do it the next morning) I was pretty screwed when it came to getting my classes for Q1 this year. 

&lt;/rant&gt;

Basically, I had to panic-enroll in MATH 18 to get the requisite 12 units for financial aid to kick in because it was the only course with available seats I actually needed to take, which made my schedule CSE 11, MATH 18, and MATH20B. My question is, on a scale from 1-10, how brutal is my schedule going to be for Q1 of freshman year?"

here's my perspective on things:

* week 1-2 are the easiest weeks in a quarter since most classes are still getting settled and are the best times to check out new orgs/groups or finding new friends.
* week 4-5 are the weeks i have less time for fun things. however, the knowledge that i'm ""half-way"" there lets me relax every now and then.
* week 8-9 are dead weeks. it's very hard to find time that isn't studying.

To be frank, it's been over a year since I took the CSE 20 equivalent at my community college and I'm pretty shakey to practically completely ignorant on the topics of CSE 20. 
Fortunately, I registered for both CSE 20 (with Mor Mia &amp; Minnes Kemp) and CSE 21 (Mike Jones) this fall, so I can drop one and choose the other.
Also, my schedule for this Fall is light with me only taking... 
• CSE 20  or  CSE 21
• ECE 35
• CSE 193 (ESRP research) 
If anyone has input or advice that would be greatly appreciated! 😁"

My Main Concern

1. Anyone know how OVT (""40/40/20"") salad works in terms of pricing? I'm looking at the HDH site, and there's no prices for stuff like Bean Sprouts, Cauliflower florets, etc. Is the cost by the oz or maybe I have to buy something first and then I get to pick it as a side? It can't just be free right?

Same for 64 degrees steamed brown rice, there's no price; I assume I can pick brown rice and they'll cook it together with your choice of vegetables/meat into one dish, but can I just order plain brown rice and nothing else?

Optional Questions

2. Anyone, know where I can buy (or order) some quinoa, oh and sweet potatoes. 

3. Can I have a rice cooker in my dorm? How about electric kettle? I heard that there is a kitchen in Angela's Space, how often you think I can access it?"

I got off the waitlist a few days ago, but the problem is, I will only have 10 minutes to make it from York Hall to WLH if I want to take BICD 100.

I am 28 years young returning student after taking a long break for personal reasons.

I've attended 1 quarter so far and have a hard time making new friends or connecting with people.

It is difficult to build friendships with the younger crowd for various reasons. Putting in effort to get along with the traditional students can come off as creepy, and I doubt the younger students would want an older dude trying so hard to hang out with the hip crowd. Not to mention the vast difference in interests, lifestyles, etc. Nothing against the younger students: I wish I could hang out with anyone regardless of age but it's more complicated than that.

Last quarter has been difficult because I made 0 friends, and it's obvious that they don't feel as comfortable when working on a project with an old dude - understandably so.

I'm not the most proactively social person, but I have no problems connecting with my age group, and having similar experiences to talk about and being an nontraditional student itself is a pretty significant way to relate.

I've seen a post here about older students like myself having a hard social, if one at all. It really sucks.

Would anyone want to meet up and make friends with other non traditional students?

I'm not the best ""leader"" for organizations and such, but I'd be willing to try what I can.

Would anyone be interested? I'd want this to be an all inclusive thing - absolutely no discrimination for ethnicity, religion, major, LGBTQ+, etc. Just don't be an asshole and have a good time - is the only thing I'd expect! Comment if interested! We can make a chat for our group or something. Any suggestions are welcome too!"

So we had a huge workload with not that much time. A lot of my classes involved self teaching. In that case, what’s the point of taking the class if we’re learning 90% of the content from a book and not a professor?

At work, my questions are answered by many people around me. My bosses and supervisors talk to me with more respect than professors. Expectations are much more realistic. 

At UCSD, when I left my classes, I still felt stressed. I had to go home and study or do time consuming homework. Sometimes I couldn’t relax because I always felt I had to be doing something for those classes. And I felt like this pretty much from week 5-finals week consistently. When I leave work now, even if it’s stressful, I leave the stress behind until I come back the next day. I don’t think about it at home or the weekend. 

I don’t spend 30 minutes a day on just parking/busses at work. 

I don’t have the pressure of not knowing what my grade is compared to the rest of the class and how the curve will be. I don’t need to worry about my education and career being delayed for months based off of one single test. 

At work, it’s clear what I need to know, and what I don’t need to know. I don’t have to attempt to understand 50 things only to be tested on 3 of them. 

People say they think it’s difficult and stressful to work here but honestly these last few months are the least stressed I’ve been in years. 

In no way am I trying to brag or rub it in students’ faces. Maybe I’m just ranting about how I really feel about college. Maybe no one cares about one person’s experience. Maybe other graduates here can relate. Maybe others’ experience is the opposite. Maybe someone here is like me and struggled in college, had a ton of uncertainty about the future and wondered if they’d do alright after graduation"

Of course if you get a homework assignment that needs it then go buy it, but it'll save you a lot of time and money if you just hold off until you've been to a lecture or two. 

Some Pro-Tips: 

- Math textbooks are dumb expensive, and in reality you only need the online access code and not the textbook. *Usually* the access code is cheaper if you buy it from the website instead of from the bookstore. ALSO - Most of the math homework websites will let you use it for about two weeks before you have to purchase. This is a great option if you think you might drop the class.

- There's a certain, [uhh](https://libgen.is/), website I would visit before purchasing the textbook (search for the ISBN to make sure it's the right version).

- If you have to buy a textbook, first try posting on the UCSD free and for sale facebook page. Someone on there definitely has an old copy laying around. They'll get a better deal from you than the textbook buyback, and you'll get a better deal than a used copy from the bookstore.

Side note: The bookstore has many problems, but they're not trying to be greedy with the textbooks. They don't set the dumb high prices, that's the publishers. The profit margin is fairly slim on most textbooks."

If the first method works and gives me a higher chance at getting in, what other bio majors should I apply for before switching to molecular &amp; cell?  


I really don't think I can stay in my major or the chem department because I've already enrolled in phys 1 series for fall quarter and I don't want to risk my GPA taking the phys 2 series, so I'm desperate to switch

I'm in my final year at UCSD and only have a few classes left to finish up before I can graduate.

1. I'm currently enrolled in TRIP and awaiting part-time status approval. Since I paid the deferment, will I be refunded when: (1) the Pell Grant is applied, (2) Health Fee Waiver is approved, and (3) part-time status is approved?  
2. After having enrolled in TRIP, it appears that the Pell Grant has not been applied when it showed prior to TRIP enrollment. Is this an error or is it just a matter of waiting?  
3. Off-topic: How are my chances of getting into waitlisted first-year linguistics courses (LISP 1B and 1BX) when I am first on the list for both? Do these courses usually have drops?

Join orgs, put yourself out there and all that.

But regardless, I’ve noticed a stark difference between UCSD and other colleges in making friends in class. I have a lot of UCR friends and it’s literally the easiest thing for them to strike up a conversation with people in their lectures/labs. They keep these friends and end up hanging outside of class like normal people.

Meanwhile at UCSD, it’s like no one wants to acknowledge each other. And if they do, it’s because they’re forced to or it’s just a question and answer. Take the Physics 1AL  lab series for example. Students don’t even bother to introduce themselves, and only interact to get it all over with. It’s like this in so many classes I’ve seen, and I’m sure it’s not just exclusive to myself.

To be honest, it just feels like UCSD students are so closed off compared to others. I’m sure there are exceptions, like if you actually find a friend group, but think of it. How open have you been to students you have just met in class?"

For starters, I keep encountering a server error that ITS can't fix, and I've tried everything on my end so welp. Secondly, OSD is still having issues because it's as if they believe disorders are temporary instead of an ongoing struggle. I have to really fight for certain accommodations, and my doctor actually used her ""mom voice"" to try to get them to listen (unfortunately, to no avail). Next, the transportation department sells yearly parking permits that aren't even valid for a year. 

I've tried to communicate with staff of many different departments regarding each of these issues (except the transportation department since that's a newer issue I'm having), but I haven't had much luck getting things resolved. I've been at the first couple issues since the beginning of this year (~February~March) and am getting tired.

Is there anything that has been successful? Or is it basically a just deal with it kind of situation? (Or leave, but as a 4th year, I think it'll be difficult even if I need an additional year.)"

I don’t know what to do since clicking the link in quotes only sends me to a general finaid page and not an overview of my account. I don’t know if this link only appeared today on the fee due date or if earlier, but I had checked the awards a couple days ago and didn’t see this there."

If I drop either one I'm only gonna be taking two classes, or 8.0 units, which I don't think is not allowed at UCSD. Either way, taking under 12.0 units a quarter is not considered being a full-time student which means bye bye financial aid.

I know a lot of you are incoming freshmen and are probably very confused about a lot of things here at UCSD. I know I was, there were many things I wish I had done sooner. A little bit about myself first. I recently graduated after I finished my summer session 2 classes a couple weeks ago. I just got my Human Biology degree signed and approved by the Biology Department, that felt really good. It was a long 4+ years. I failed many classes, cried many times, but I also made a great many people, people who I know will be my friends for a long time to come.  I actually still live in the area and I am currently involved as a volunteer at the Food Co-op and the Che Cafe. I joined the Food Co-op middle of Fall quarter of my 4th year. This was the best decision I ever made in my entire college career. I learned a great deal about myself and how to better interact with others, time management, responsibility, communication, etc. Soon after I joined the Che Cafe and got involved in leftist circles, the punk and local DIY music scene, as well as more vegan cooking(i love food). These two places have been the most enriching parts of my life and I would invite everyone to join either one of these 2 cooperatives on campus, there is a lot of great history in these two buildings and they are great opportunities to make friends. I think the best I can tell any of you is to quickly find those spaces with people who you care about and they care about you, it doesn't have to be the Food Coop or the Che, it can be the LGBTQ+ center, Raza Centro, maybe Triton Gaming, or one of the many many clubs at UCSD. I truly believe there is a place in this campus for everyone, it might just take you a while to find it.

Now, for some more ""practical"" advice:

* If you qualify for financial aid, any of the cal or pell grants, do not waive UC Ship. You will pay for it in the first bill but after about a month or so they will refund you for it. If you are unsure, you can go ask the financial aid office, they have always been really helpful to me. 
* If you fail a class, it isn't the end of the world. You can retake up to 16 units, and unless you are double majoring or in engineering/com sci, there is usually a fair amount of flexibility with scheduling. I failed 5 classes and I barely passed this last summer session but I fucking did it, you can do it too. 
* Do not take more than 16-18 units per quarter unless there is really no choice, ideally, 12 units is best, it allows for enough free time to study, work, and/or take care of yourself. I took 4 classes for almost 3 years straight and finally being able to chill out and only take 3 classes a quarter had a big positive impact on my grades and mental health.

If anyone has any questions/would like to talk more with me, feel free to send me a DM or just comment below. I'm sure I can be of some help, I will be around at the Che and the Food Coop a lot once the school year starts. The original student center is my second home.

I was the second to move in about three days ago. My roommate who moved in a couple hours before me is the one with the...odor problem. 

Here’s the thing. I feel like normal people wouldn’t be bothered by this or wouldn’t even notice (like my second roommate) but I have what my parents call a “special” nose. Basically, I have a hypersensitive sense of smell. To give you some context, I can usually smell and identify the contents of someone’s lunch encased in a lunchbox and sitting in a locker a few feet away. 

To my second roommate, she thinks the room smells like rosemary. Every time I walk in, however, I am immediately overwhelmed by the wave of the shoe odor. I don’t think my other roommate can smell the undertones of the smell and correctly identify what it is, but to be fair it is a different kind of shoe smell, not the usual gym-socky tortilla-chip business. I would almost say it is a diluted version of an ammonia-based/litterbox smell mixed with what my roommate’s house probably smelled like. 

The problem is, she’s already trying to fix it, it’s just not working. The room’s window is open 24/7, a fan’s oscillating 24/7, the shoes are sitting by said window, and she applied some odor-eliminating product to them today. 

But I can still smell it. I’m writing this while laying down in my loft bed trying not to breathe too deep. I know this smell is 100% from her shoes because when I first moved in, I was looking out the window (right next to the shoes) when I first smelled the...smell. 

I don’t want this to be permanent, because I don’t want it to stick to me or my stuff. Since I already have a sensitive nose, it would be hell if a scent stuck to me. I can’t be around perfume/cologne and I definitely can’t have any on myself, and (tmi warning) when I’m on my period, it is the worst week of the month. 

I just don’t know how to approach this. She’s already trying to fix it, so I can’t just tell her to throw her shoes away or something! She’s such a great roommate, so it’s definitely not something worth switching over. But holy shit this is hard. Help!!"

This tool was developed to better organize the data provided on [cape.ucsd.edu](https://cape.ucsd.edu). The following is a few features to justify the project's name, [BetterCape.com](https://BetterCape.com):

&amp;#x200B;

* Aggregate data -- Combines all similar courses a professor has taught to give a more complete overview of their class.

[For example, our good friend Gary has taught CSE 15L twenty seven times and over those twenty seven courses students have received an average grade of 3.26. Enrolling in a Gary course might be worth it with those stats :O](https://i.redd.it/2f4jzznd0lo31.png)

&amp;#x200B;

* Expand the aggregate data to get a breakdown of all courses.

[Clicking on a row in the table will bring up a modal showing all the courses that make up the aggregate data. Here, by clicking on the Gary row, we can see all of the twenty seven CSE15L courses he has taught, and the stats for each.](https://i.redd.it/pust17zs0lo31.png)

&amp;#x200B;

* Course grouping -- Whereas the order in which UCSD displays the CAPE data is sorted by quarter and lexicographically (causing CSE 100 to come before CSE 11, for example), BetterCape groups courses together by their numeric course code ordering and orders by term within that. This makes searching through a whole department much more intuitive.

[Very readable, incredible.](https://i.redd.it/xarqc9c51lo31.png)

&amp;#x200B;

* Filters! A feature completely missing from traditional capes.

[Here we are searching for upper division courses in the CSE department, taught during the years 2017 up to and including 2019, with an average received GPA of at least 3.5.](https://i.redd.it/qt2tv7ii1lo31.png)

So yeah, if this looks like it would be useful to you, I would love to have you guys check it out. At the very least, I think it is a much cleaner version of UCSD's capes. I would love some feedback from you guys! If this is something I see people are actually using I would definitely like to expand it to do some more interesting analysis.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if this is something you think would be interested in working in, especially for people who are more talented than I with UX / web design definitely lemme know! (Mobile in particular is garbage at the moment)

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck with your Fall quarter everyone, hope this helps!"

Please help! This fall [www.uconline.edu](http://www.uconline.edu/) shut down, and are no longer offering courses. Does anyone know of a similar alternative for UC classes?

Some notes: I'm no longer a current UC student so I'm ineligible for the cross-campus enrollment program. I can't really do concurrent enrollment either since I'm not anywhere near a campus. I would commute to UCM since it's closest to me but classes started in August.

So, I need help finding out how I can enroll in online classes at a UC, as a non-UC student. It can be any UC, any classes, as long as they're for credit. (I need two more courses/8 units to satisfy my [readmission](https://registrar.ucdavis.edu/registration/return/readmission) requirements, and would've completed them by winter quarter if uconline was still up and running). I've already looked through the links the uconline page provides and haven't found what I'm looking for but maybe someone else will notice something I've missed, or know about a program I don't. I can't talk to and ask my counselor until Thursday, so I'm in a stressful rush to find somewhere to enroll.

Thanks in advance!"

1. im looking at my academic history trying to figure out how many more units do i need to be junior standing and im not really sure what category im supposed to be looking at? is it the 'crdts pssd' or 'uc-gpa crdts'?
2.  does anyone know if it's hard to get approved to take an upper division class if you're not in upper division standing? the class im trying to take is in the sociology department and it says to contact their department, but im not really sure what to say to them?"

What are the cut offs that I can expect for both of these courses? The screening courses that I have to take are Math 20C, Chem 6a&amp;6B, Phys 2A&amp;2B, and MAE 8. For MechE, its the same screening courses but with Chem6B subtracted. Am I expected to get like, all A's and 1 A- at the most for these courses in order to be somewhat competitive?

My GPA is shit (3.2), so I'm looking at options for my backup major, as well as other schools. Regarding UCSD, I'm thinking of selecting Earth Science as my secondary major; problem is, I would need additional courses, therefore I wouldn't gave all my major prep done by my hypothetical transfer date as far as the application review board is concerned (although I would definitely do summer courses to make this gap up if I were accepted). With that in mind:

1)what are my chances of getting into UCSD under a noncapped major (Earth Science) with two lower division courses pending (the JC equivalents of Chem 6B/6C and a bio course)?

2)There are a minimum of 12 major-specific lower-division courses for SIO's Earth Sciences BS. Typically, for those of you who are SIO students who transferred, how long did it take you to graduate after transfer?

Thank you in advance."

In the email they said to follow these instructions:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;1. The online Health Fee Waiver application is only available through [TritonLink](http://email.ahpcare.com/f/a/6Kem0bhUGfBIb7oLEJocxw~~/AABPAAA~/RgRfbLkQP0QvaHR0cDovL3d3dy51Y3NkLmVkdS9jdXJyZW50LXN0dWRlbnRzL2luZGV4Lmh0bWxXA3NwY0IKAACQhYtdSnC06FIRZW5vZ2FsZXNAdWNzZC5lZHVYBAAAAAA~) during scheduled waiver periods.   
&gt;  
&gt;2. Select ""TritonLinkTools"", then under FinancialTools, select ""Health Fee Waiver"".  
&gt;  
&gt;3. The ""Health Fee Waiver"" link will take you to your SSO, where you will log in.  
&gt;  
&gt;4. You will then be directed to the Health Fee Waiver questionnaire on the AHP website.  
&gt;  
&gt;5. Complete the insurance information and sub'mit your Health Fee Waiver request.

&amp;#x200B;

But every time I try to do submit this additional information / letter of coverage I find myself at the ""Apply for a Waiver"" page, which only has the ""Submit Waiver"" button at the button. And this button is itself locked since the late deadline for submitting a waiver request was Sep 27th.  On top of that, I could only receive the letter of coverage yesterday.

Sorry if this is all too convoluted or doesn't make sense, I've been trying to concentrate and make this post legible and whatnot but it's really difficult with my family making a *lot* of noise at the moment. 

Now my question is, I don't know where else to submit my additional information besides this website?? Where can I upload this additional information. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you."

I was wondering how likely it is that I will get off the waitlist for DSC10. When I enrolled everyone joined a waitlist and they let people off based on priority. Currently I am second on the waitlist. I can’t really use the 10% rule to make judgments because everyone was on the waitlist to begin with. Furthermore one of my friends who was also waitlisted (who also isn’t a data science major) said he was enrolled which I assume meant he made it off the waitlist.

Due to that, I've just been doing GE's. Recently I settled on Marine Biology and though I'm not sure about it, I'm proceeding for now because no other major reallyappeals to me. There's just one problem. Marine biology requires up to math 10C and previously I've only taken up to 10B, and that was last winter. I've already forgotten a ton and I'm worried a bit about it. I signed up for 10C this quarter as a backup class with Professor Au, but switched out this morning because my roommate said taking him was the worst decision he made. I am now waitlisted (2) for professor Dresslers class additionally as a backup class, but I'm worried if I don't take it soon, I'm going to further forget things, and 10a/b already were not a walk in the park for me. But I checked her rate my professor and despite her lecture going well, she received an even worse score than Au! I've spoken to a couple of math professors prior to her class this morning about what I should do, but its a hard question and accordingly, their answers were little help. I've thought about maybe doing it during the summer at some community college, but theissues with that are obviously that I can't take any other classes (Really) that summer, and that I'd be waiting even longer to take the class and also finding a cc that offers the course near my home, which had proven to be difficult last summer. I really have no idea what to do. I suppose a starter question could be, does it matter the proximity I take 10c from my last math classes? Is it primarily new stuff starting from scratch or does it rely on the concepts learned in past classes. Please help.

Tl;Dr
 It's been a while since taking my last math class and I'm worried about how I'm going to take 10c without much memory of 10a/b, and the professor's aren't anything to write home about."

I am a Revelle student recently overflowed so I have never seen one in person before. I thought I could casually walk past them, but when I took a step forward one of them suddenly turned around and stared at me. Its pitch-black beady eyes bore into my soul as I froze dead in my tracks. Still, it proceeded to arch its back, bare its fangs, and lunge at me. Never in my life have I sprinted backwards so fast, even though it was into a parking lot. 

When I left all 10 of them started fighting each other, running up trees, screeching like cats being murdered. It lasted like half an hour. I had never seen such horror come from (what I thought were) such cute creatures. Even though my friend reported the incident to campus police I'm still pretty shaken up. Pair this with the extreme isolation, and 20+ minute walk to get anywhere relevant on campus that comes from being in Sixth, I'm kind of getting sick of it. I never thought I'd ever have to literally run for my life, but boyyy did I learn tonight..."

I want to schedule a coffee date or lunch (which do you think is better?) with a former retired English teacher. The purpose would be to catch up and find out how she is doing. Below is the letter I plan to ask a teacher that knows where she lives, to mail to her. Any small or large suggestions for improvement would really be appreciated!!! 


Dear Ms.(her name),

I went to (school's name) some time ago to visit you and 2 other teachers. You the two other teachers were really impactful on my high school education and I wanted to see how you were doing and give you a gift. I heard that you are retired. Please call me at (my cell phone number) so we can schedule a time to meet for coffee and talk about how is retirement going for you, how is your granddaughter and so I can also give you your gift which I still have and I really think you will like. (Another teacher's name) will forwarded this letter to you. Someone once told me you live in (her city's name). I don't know if that is true. My grandmother lives in (her city's name) and I live with her in her house 4 days a week and live in (the city that the high school is in) with my siblings and parents, 3 days a week. My job is very flexible in terms of hours and I work from home so my schedule is very flexible. Traveling isn't an issue for me. Let's meet at a place that is convenient for you. Maybe we could meet at a coffee shop. Btw, the coffee would be my treat! :-) Or we can meet anywhere else that is convenient for you. You had a lot of students and if you don't remember me, please don't feel bad. :-) I would be happy to jog your memory about anything related to me. (I don't want her to decline meeting me because she doesn't remember who I am. She is kinda old and had bad health when she was my teacher so maybe has memory issues. I don't know how to say, ""don't feel bad if you don't remember me"" in a better way. I especially need help with rewording this)

Regards,

(my name)

Any small or large suggestions for improvement would really be appreciated!!! Thank you in advance, kind strangers &lt;3

Tl;dr: Not sure what should write as letter to reconnect to retired teacher. Need help!"

The rest, then are caps/hats and shirts/jackets that say “UCSD (insert family relation here)”

Because we have a very large Chinese diaspora here at UCSD I thought this might be an important topic we should all be interested in.   

  

There are real aspects of the current Chinese regime which the populace may not be aware of, and may not want to be aware of.    

There are the humanitarian issues surrounding [the TienAnMen Square protests](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/tiananmen-square-massacre-death-toll-secret-cable-british-ambassador-1989-alan-donald-a8126461.html) where thousands of people were killed. Recent reports of [Uyghur people being murdered for their organs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2019/06/18/china-killing-prisoners-to-harvest-organs-for-transplant-tribunal-finds/#56eef7d053d4), also [reports of this happening to Falun Gong practitioners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_harvesting_from_Falun_Gong_practitioners_in_China).   
The Chinese suppression of [liberty in Tibet](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-14533879), [Taiwan](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/04/30/china-u-s-taiwan-relations-are-in-choppy-waters-heres-whats-going-on/), [HongKong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Mainland_China_conflict).   
And the Chinese [environmental disaster around releasing and non-report of CFCs](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/23/china-factories-releasing-thousands-of-tonnes-of-illegal-cfc-gases-study-finds).  

Should we as UCSD students lead the charge on awareness of the atrocities being carried out by one of the countries a bulk of our international students come from? If we want to change the world, should we not bring light to issues purposefully hidden by this government? We ask in our poli-sci classes what people under repressive regimes could have done differently to change the course of history. Why not educate and act."

This   is the most insane but completely non-fiction story you will ever see.   It is however having trouble getting traction, and getting   censored\\banned. Some of the ways this is happening are explained in the   update section near the end of the document. Media is currently   ignoring this story. This is an effort to create public awareness, so   that bribes, blackmail, censorship, and secret deals cannot allow these   vile criminals to maintain the status quo, and remain in office.

Billions   in bribes were paid to Trump, Pelosi, Schumer, Harris and others to   enable a Soros, Koch, and Porter funded child raping ring to operate in   the USA. Below will contain excerpts from the 84 page PDF document  which  can be downloaded near the end of this post. **Please download** **and listen to the links below.** **Turn up the volume and put headphones on.** **You will hear these people and many other high profile people, incriminate themselves in unbelievable fashion.**

* Multi-billionaire   George Soros announces he is picking up 300 kids in Hungary, and wants   to celebrate by kicking off a ‘rape party” tonight. He starts speaking   around 1429:

Notable   attendees of this “rape party”, which occurred in Buffalo, New York,  on  January 14th into 15th, 2019 included: Bill DeBlasio, Andrew Cuomo,   Bill Murray, Peter Buttgeig, George Soros, Barack Obama, Steve Scalise,   among several others.

1019   Porter: People are laughing because they think four billion is too   much. I think it's not a problem when you have $35 billion.

1022 Donald Trump: You better have that $4 billion or you can kiss this shit goodbye.

The Porter’s had pushed for a murder-for-hire and rape of the tenant,   but had to settle for this illegal removal performed by the Buffalo   Police violating the 	tenant’s fourth amendment rights on January 18,   2019:

Matthew Porter: ""We have 	to thin the herd, so Barack is  going to  explain a few things."" 	At 2:32am Barack Obama says the  following: ""You  people have to 	realize we are child rapists.

\\\\Please   post this anywhere you can! Create your own posts with this or other   excerpt from the PDF. This information keeps getting blocked, censored,   'down/voted' etc. These people are extremely wealthy and throw money to   anyone who will help them cover up their child rapes , child murders,   and corruption. This is usually done through a receivership transfer   where you receive the funds after for or more day, and it can be pulled   at the last second, which is usually the case after you've done them  the  ""service"" as they call it. Please help get the word out. Soon it  will  no longer be able to be ignored.

A   word about the ""faggot"" usage: it was a necessary tool. It showed  three  things: they were not in control of the situation, if they were  the  usage would have been stopped. Everyone out there needed to see  this, as  it was contrary to the picture they were painting. Two, it  made it  unpleasant for them to be in the telepathic headspace \[see  reference  item G in the PDF\], which has obvious advantages. Three, it  pointed out  impersonators of B.S. in the headspace, because they would  not call each  other “faggot”, and in turn giving themselves away thus  helping to  mitigate the spread of false information. Apologies for  those  unintentionally offended. On that note, I give you former  President  Barack Obama in a foursome with Peter Thiel, Jack Dorsey, and  Matthew  Porter. It is on page 12 of the document where you can  download the  video containing audio footage of the ""event"". Link for  the PDF is just  above under ""Full 84 page document"".

Also, are her exams hard in general or are they very representative of her lecture slides? Idk if it is worth it to take the class as p/np or as a letter grade. I've had Hanes for PSYC 1, and her exams were almost exactly from the lecture slides, so if Caballero does the same thing with her exams I'd rather take it as a letter grade and not waste the opportunity for an easy A.

I'm a recent UCSD grad that spent 4 years on the track and field team. I recently found out that last week, unbeknownst to me, the people currently on the team, or the coaches, the Athletics department sold the team windbreakers with other stuff in front of RIMAC.

Those windbreakers have a long tradition for the team. It was the de facto uniform for us for team pictures and competition (no matter how hot it was, if you made it to the podium for your event, you wore that jacket). I was so proud to wear it at every meet. I was a walk-on and never thought I was good enough to be part of a college sport. As much as I hated turning it in at the end of last year, I did believing it was going to continue to be reused by the team.

If you (or someone you know) has one of the jackets and would be willing to sell it to me, please DM me. I wore the Medium and Large ones depending on the year. If you have other sizes and would be willing to sell, please also DM me since I know my former teammates are also really sad that the jackets were sold and appreciate a chance. It would really mean so much, so please do consider! Thank you!

TL;DR: Athletics department sold our old team jackets without warning. Lots of sentimental value. I would really appreciate the chance to buy one off of you."

The Chinese government even retaliated against UCSD for the invitation.

Do not fall into the trap of hating Chinese international students. Even the ones who oppose the HK protests are being lied to by their government. More importantly, don't play into that government's hands by brushing this off. They want you to be apathetic so you won't resist next time they reach into your lives.

This was the first in a series of three meetings this school year about Sixth's transition to its new location. Without further ado...

* Next year, Sixth College will move entirely from it's current location to the North Torrey Pines Living and Learning Neighborhood (also to be called the Sixth College Neighborhood)
   * This is the area over former parking lots P207 and P208, so Marshall will be to the north and east and Muir will be to the south
   * Current Muir College Drive will terminate at Scholars Drive North, promenade will connect to Ridge Walk
   * When Sixth moves, current Sixth Res Halls will be demolished (summer 2020), Seventh will move into The Village, transfer students will move into current Sixth College Apartments/Matthews Apartments
      * vertical structures will be built over current Sixth Res Halls
      * Sixth College Apartments/Matthews Apartments will eventually be demolished (\~10 years)
* Comprised of six buildings total, Sixth College has administration over four of them (presumably buildings 2-5)
   * temporary building names are numerical, with 1 in the northeast corner and increasing counterclockwise (3 and 4 are closest to ocean)
   * Building 1 will contain arts and humanities as well as social sciences
   * Building 2 is residential, will contain Sixth College Administrative Center
   * Building 3 is residential, will contain a 300-person classroom potentially used for movie screenings or other events (this may be the digital stage)
   * Building 4 is residential
   * Building 5 is residential, will contain a two-story themed dining hall, a market, four retail stores, and potentially a coffee shop
   * Building 6 is an auditorium
   * buildings will be LEED Platinum certified, with energy-efficient lighting, some solar panels, an anaerobic trash thingy, etc.
   * buildings will be 14/15 stories tall, views ""get good above the sixth floor"" (including ocean views!)
      * meeting rooms on top floors, although likely restricted access by which groups control them
      * Provost Chilukuri doesn't get an ocean view office :(
* Neighborhood will also contain
   * two green lawns, West Quad and East Quad, surrounded by the buildings
      * paths stretch across these lawns
   * underground parking lot beneath neighborhood
      * accessed near Buildings 2 and 5
      * likely no S spaces
   * many balconies
   * many mixed indoor-outdoor spaces
   * lounges and gathering spaces in residential buildings
      * currently negotiating with campus to improve campus-wide access to public spaces, including lounges
   * community garden atop Building 3
   * the return of the Craft Center in Building 5 (will host classes, likely will have to sign up to use space)
   * digital stage, music room, sound booth (latter two in Building 4)
   * new and improved Sixth College Commuter Lounge
   * smart classroom, other classrooms, conference rooms
   * basketball courts
* Residential space will have room for 2010 beds as currently planned
   * (Sixth currently plans to house 1600-1800 students, extra beds will be used for overflow from other colleges)

At the town hall, administration fielded suggestions for festivals to commemorate the transition as well as alternate building name suggestions. There will be opportunities both online and in person to suggest ideas, which are not limited. For example, people suggested art installations and allowing crafts classes to fulfill GEs, although the latter idea would take dedicated effort. The next town hall will likely be in Winter Quarter 2020.

I hope that you all have been adjusting or re-adjusting to college life well over the last few weeks. The subreddit has certainly seen an uptick in activity since the quarter started. ([Click here](https://i.imgur.com/QKjpyZ2.png) if you're curious to see what that looks like!)

And with that uptick... comes questions. Questions, questions, questions. Now, I'm sure that most of you are aware that many of the posts submitted to r/UCSD are centered around various questions that users have about the courses, events, and resources that UC San Diego offers. Our current policy is that any questions about specific courses or events should be directed to the subreddit's [current megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/dfa6v0/fall_quarter_2019_qa_megathread_course/). The reason we do this is to prevent the subreddit's front page from being flooded with questions, most of which only relate to specific classes. However, please let us know if you disagree with us on this. We'll always be open to feedback and criticism so long as it remains respectful, and we welcome suggestions for how to approach this differently.

[You might have also noticed that the subreddit FAQ is a bit, uh, barebones at the moment.](https://old.reddit.com/r/UCSD/wiki/faq) **That's why we want to ask everyone what questions they think should be addressed in the FAQ.** Should we address why UCSD is not, as is often asked, ""UC Socially Dead""? Are the new rule changes in on-campus parking something that deserves to be mentioned? How about the largely unspoken rules of commuting across campus? Feel free to mention any questions that you think should be included in the comments of this post! While you're at it, if you write a helpful response to that question, we might even feature you in the FAQ itself!

That's all for now. Please contact us through the mod mail if you have any questions or comments. We're counting on everyone to help us improve r/UCSD!"

I'm creating this thread due the the excellent responses I got from the [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/dfzyxu/we_should_do_something_in_solidarity_with_hong/) from yesterday.

Having talked to many people and read all of your posts/PMs I've come up with the beginnings of a plan. I'll detail it here:

\#PHASE 1:

Flyers, chalk and contacting orgs.

The most immediate thing we can do is to start chalking blackboards on campus, handing out/taping up flyers and contacting clubs to try to garner more support. We need three things for this to happen:

1. A design for a flyer, monochrome, in Chinese and English with as few words and as large test as possible.

2. Simple slogans to chalk up, all of us practicing a few Chinese characters would not be a bad idea for this.

3. A template for contacting clubs. We need to come across as organized and professional. Having a well designed template can help with this (although it could also come across as spam, this can be further discussed)

Thanks to /u/Welpmart for this list of clubs to start contacting, if there are any you'd like to add please post them in response:

[egchrist@ucsd.edu](mailto:egchrist@ucsd.edu) (Model UN. International focus, all about global citizens.) 

[ucsdmasa@gmail.com](mailto:ucsdmasa@gmail.com) (Multi-Asian Student Association)

[soarucsd123@gmail.com](mailto:soarucsd123@gmail.com) (Student Organization for Activism and Representation.) 

\#PHASE 2:

T-shirts, facemasks/bandanas and petitions.

Ordering bulk custom clothing is going to take a couple weeks for everything to ship. We also need to come up with designs (I am not a good designer unfortunately).

The clothing should be black with white lettering as a single color will be much cheaper. It should also be related in some way to UCSD, this might force the school administration to respond. Let's come up with slogans in English and Chinese and designs for these items.

Once the shirts/bandanas arrive we should start handing them out in exchange for students signing a petition. This will serve two purposes: 

a) It will prevent people who don't support us from taking clothing and throwing it away (they won't want to sign a petition)

b) Getting more people to sign petitions (like the ones [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/cv0ws4/how_can_you_help_hong_kong_protests_from_abroad/)) is another thing we can do to help the protesters. Contacting our representatives en mass and with petitions could also have a good impact.

I'm willing to fund getting the first batch of clothing myself. The two websites I've looked at so far are [rushordertees](https://www.rushordertees.com/custom/wholesale-t-shirts/) and [vistaprint](https://www.vistaprint.com/?couponAutoload=1&amp;GP=10%2f11%2f2019+10%3a33%3a01&amp;GPS=5500934757&amp;GNF=0). If people know better places I'd love to here them.

\#PHASE 3: 

Semi-permanent displays and protests.

The intention for the first two phases are to raise awareness and gather as much support as possible. I think one of the most effective things we can do is to have a display sanctioned by the school on library walk. It would be illegal to dismantle it and the school would have to openly side with the HK protesters. This may be fairly unrealistic but it should be something we push the school administration on. 

We should be contacting journalists at this stage to explain the schools unwillingness to support Hong Kong, try to bring pressure to bear from every angle at this point.

\#People who have showed interest in supporting this:

There are more that I missed and some who PM'd me who I'm not going to post the names of publicly. I'd like to meet in person soon, preferably sometime next week, to get phase 1 started. I'll pay fro mass printing of flyers as well as supplies. When we meet we can coordinate strategies to maximize exposure while minimizing risk to ourselves. I'm free most evenings except for Tuesdays and Thursdays. What we can all do right now is creating templates, start sending messages to clubs and creating designs for shirts and flyers.

If there are any other ideas or suggestions I'd love to hear them, thank you all for your outspoken support!"

I had a question for the MS CSE students here.

I saw that the requirements for the MS CSE program is 40 units.

I'm an international student, so I have to be enrolled in at least 12 units per semester. That also means I cannot delay graduation once I'm done with my 40 units.

My plan is to spread out my time in at least 4 quarters, so that I have enough time to do at least 1 summer internship, and also I can look for full-time jobs in my last fall quarter too. I'm thinking a 12/12/12/4 units split would allow me to study in 4 quarters. Is this what most people do? Does that mean most MS CSE folk graduate in December, and usually only take 4 units their last quarter?

Also while I'm at it - would you say that the comprehensive exam at the end of the course is difficult to pass? Are there many cases where MS degrees are denied because a student has failed the comprehensive exam?

Thanks!"

I once lived in the U.S briefly when I was a young teen. Tbh, I remember I experienced sort of racism. After then, I had never expected myself to live abroad but guess what, I'm here.
Back at my home university, even though I was a born and raised there I wasn't able to make a sincere friend (seriously) I didn't go visit a mental hospital but I believe I was in low key depression because of school life there. (I know this is futile but don't assume from this that I might be a weirdo. The university was hardly social and ppl were very exclusive to each other I swear.) That's why I applied to UCSD for this exchange program. I wanted to make happy memories and meet cool people. And maybe I can rebuild self confidence from healthy relationships. 

I feel like I have taken this way too far to get this point.
My problem is I feel like I'm being paranoid but maybe not. 
I expected to make friends at classes, with natural vibe. However, I was shocked to find that most of my classes are hundreds of ppl. Fortunately, every class we have small talk to ppl next to their seats when professors let us talk about iclicker questions or something. I have been noticing that both ppl who sit next to me just turn away from me and talk to the other person they sit next to no matter what. It isn't like I tried to pay attention to it but it happens every day every class to become so obvious that I couldn't help but realize it. 
Aside from lectures and discussion sessions, it is so natural for other people to befriend with some you just happen to sit next to but well, not for me. 
Why do I not have guts to talk first?
Trust me, literally as soon as the discussion starts they turn to the other at no second. 
Literally, no one talks up to me first unless I snatch that person before he turns his/her head to the other side. 
I went to some club's first days and I don't even want to remember. 

Do you think I'm being a paranoid?
It isn't like I smell or look dirty. I look okay. 
Or could it be that they have prejudices that I'm that kind of asian who keeps herself to her own or just tries to stick to her own ethnic groups? Is it that people don't really want to talk to international ppl? 
I just want to make new good friends. I really wish. 
I was actually so sick of ppl from my original country cuz I just don't like the social tradition and stuff. 
I am so suffering from this negative thought but it just seems so real to me. I feel depressed and discouraged and disappointed towards people. And at the same time, I reflect on myself thinking am I overthinking? and come back to this thought is racism a real thing here? Should I change my look to look like non international asian? Should I seriously consider wearing contact lenses every day not to look too geek? 
I hate to say this but there aren't really signs from me that I'm the streotype. I don't bring expensive stuff I don't dress up I don't speak my mother toung (cuz I have no one to talk to LOL) 

SUMMARY:
I thought ppl here would be very open, outgoing and friendly. I am not a shy person I could just say Hi to random ppl close to me if I want to. But wait a second, does anyone EVER talk to me first?
It's just that something that seems very natural to happen to ppl (from my observation) and I do see it happening to them but it does not happen to me at all and I'm thinking why would it be?

If you could kindly leave frank advices or heartful thoughts I would be very much appreciated. 

Thank you for reading this endless whiny post though"

This is the most insane but completely non-fiction story you will ever  see.   It is however having trouble getting traction, and getting censored\\banned. Some of the ways this is happening are explained in the update section near the end of the document. Media is currently ignoring this story. This is an effort to create public awareness, so that bribes, blackmail, censorship, and secret deals cannot allow these vile criminals to maintain the status quo, and remain in office.

Billions in bribes were paid to Trump, Pelosi, Schumer, Harris and others to    enable a Soros, Koch, and Porter funded child raping ring to operate in the USA. **The content below will contain excerpts from the 84 page PDF document which can be downloaded near the end of this post.

\\\\Please  post this anywhere you can! Create your own posts with this or other    excerpt from the PDF. This information keeps getting blocked,  censored,   'down/voted' etc. These people are extremely wealthy and  throw money to   anyone who will help them cover up their child rapes ,  child murders,   and corruption. This is usually done through a  receivership transfer  where you receive the funds after for or more  day, and it can be pulled  at the last second, which is usually the  case after you've done them  the  ""service"" as they call it. Please help  get the word out. Soon it  will no longer be able to be ignored.

A    word about the ""faggot"" usage: it was a necessary tool. It showed  three  things: they were not in control of the situation, if they were   the  usage would have been stopped. Everyone out there needed to see   this, as  it was contrary to the picture they were painting. Two, it   made it  unpleasant for them to be in the telepathic headspace \[see *reference item G* in the PDF\], which has obvious advantages. Three, it   pointed out  impersonators of B.S. in the headspace, because they would  not call each  other “faggot”, and in turn giving themselves away thus  helping to  mitigate the spread of false information. Apologies for   those  unintentionally offended. On that note, I give you former   President  Barack Obama in a foursome with Peter Thiel, Jack Dorsey, and   Matthew  Porter.

Quite a few people responded showing interest in meeting up to start posting flyers. Right now I think the best time to meet would be 5pm on the 20th, we can do our first flyering campaign then, as they should (hopefully) still be up on Monday. I think meeting in a central location on campus would be good too so we can spread out easily after the meeting, I'll be in the outdoor eating section of the Price Center (where the fountains and theater entrance are). I have long, curly red hair so I'm hard to miss. I will be bringing flyers and other supplies on the 20th so we can get started immediately.

I also started a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/srDf8ke) to carry out planning and discussion as reddit is not the easiest platform to do this on. If any one wants to volunteer to help moderate please let me know.

Thank you to everyone who responded! I hope to see you there.

I specifically want to go to UCSF for nursing, and they have an accelerated program for people who hold a different bachelors degree, but it’s a year longer than their normal masters program and it’s..... 66k a year. (school will cost around 200k by the time i get a masters to become a nurse practitioner)

Is it worth it?

However, an Uber from UCSD to SAN is between $25-$35 (without a tip), which adds a total of about $60 dollars (minimum with tip) to my trip. I’ve dont this a few times from UCSD to SAN, since I have freinds who I would occasionally visit, and haven’t seen the prices decrease beyond that.

First item I'm selling is a logitech z5500 for $60. If you type ""legendary logitech speakers"" on google this is the first hit. It works perfectly and I've set it up so it's easy for you to test it. The reason it's cheap it's because the system is way too heavy for me to sell, or ship, and I'm moving out soon. It's an amazing deal and a great system better in many way's than the z906 on amazon for $253. So if you're looking for a really good basic sound setup for college but don't want to break the bank, you can't go wrong with this. Here's a picture: https://i.imgur.com/IXpoLtj.jpg

I've threw a lot of great kickbacks with this guy :). 

The second is two Optimum Nutrition Whey Protein Powder of two flavors: Double Rich Chocolate and Chocolate Mint for $30 each. Reason I'm selling is because I couldn't get to them in time :(. If you missed on the recent deals, or you didn't want to pay $90 to buy 3 O.N. wheys, you can just tell me which one you want and get it. You don't have to buy both. Both of them expire in 2020. One in october 2020, the other february 2020.

The last item is my 4k monitor, specifically, this one https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IRQAYPE/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1 for $175.

Hit me up with any questions you have or if you're interested in buying them I'll get in touch with you and make sure everything goes smoothly.

Thanks for everything y'all. Good luck in your studies."

I won't be able to get any answers for the midterm until or IF I'm able to connect. (This is for CENG/NANO 15) I have two more midterms in this class that will be open PC and I will need MATLAB and if I can't connect for any I probably won't do well.

Clarification: I have a chromebook, so I am forced to use the online version, while most other people are able to install it on their computer. Also my service (T-mobile) doesn't have good data in Center so the hotspot isn't strong enough to load the online version.

UCSD please do something about the wifi in congested areas like Peterson, Center, and Warren Lecture hall I'm actually begging you."

Parting advice to /r/UCSD (mod team included :] ) - lighten up y'all! There's a lot of negativity that gets thrown around on social media and if you're not careful you'll end up in a bad mood all day over some shit that doesn't affect you. 

Finally to ResNet - I've been gone for three weeks and you guys broke the WiFi!? Fix it y'all!

Happy Friday."

it also doesnt help that it takes me like over 6 hours to do one reading most of the time. even if i say i have a goal of reading them i feel i am just incapable of doing it.. :(

djvnaw,Minoring in CS as a Cog Sci: Neuroscience Major.,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/djvnaw/minoring_in_cs_as_a_cog_sci_neuroscience_major/,lilRoger31,1,2019-10-18 16:23:14,4,/r/UCSD/comments/djvnaw/minoring_in_cs_as_a_cog_sci_neuroscience_major/,Question,"Hey guys, so I am in my **junior year** and I really need some advice on whether or not I should pursue CSE minor.

Background:

**Cog sci, neuroscience majo**r, and I was pre-med until this year where I realize I want to do research more (so grad school, Ph.D. kinda direction).

So as for now, I should be able to graduate a year or at least 2 quarters early.

Motivation:

So since I decided on the change of my career direction it gave me a lot more free time to take classes that I am more interested in.

The reason why I want to have a cs minor is because I want to have a better understanding and grasp on programming overall with the hope that it will further my career and maybe merge my passion in neuroscience with AI/deep learning and stuff?? Because, I am not planning on staying in academia after grad school and I think programming is just a very useful skill to have.

Worries:

One of my biggest concerns is the tuition.

\- Since I am an international student, I have to pay roughly 16K quarterly. So it is quite a financial burden for my family and I. Because if I decide to just graduate early, I would apply for a lab technician job and start earning some income and then apply for grad school.

Another concern is:

\- are these classes actually useful? Or are they helpful for direct application? Because I know computer science does not equal software development and from the minor website, I saw we also need to learn about discrete math, some Computer engineering-related classes?? So is it really worth the effort and money? I mean I could always just take a boot camp class online to learn what I really need to know for my field. (e.g. Deep learning?)

Current situation:

I have taken cogs 18, cogs 108, and I am taking cogs 109 and CSE 8A rn.

So I would say I feel more comfortable (still have a lot to learn) with python and I had no experience with Java or C.

So what is your guys’ perspective on this?"

I just want to be prepared for anything and make the experience better for my friend as well. The only coding experience we have is Intro to Programming which is similar to UCSD's CSE 11. 

Anyways, I have looked at other threads about SD Hacks, looked at videos and read the FAQ section on the website. I just wanted to ask more specific things and get some advice. What are some must brings? Where do people sleep? How do people not smell, is there a shower or something? How's parking? Anything I should be aware of? Is stealing an issue? Is our project going to be displayed to everyone? Will computers be provided? Some of these questions I understand cannot be answered on here so I will email SD Hacks later today as well. I just want to see perspective from other students as well.

&gt;	Once the full evaluation process is completed, it is likely that about half of the buildings that are currently in the “V” category will potentially be given a category “IV” rating which is considered seismic safety policy compliant.

UCSD has already been in the process of retrofitting and replacing buildings, as all UC buildings need to be seismically sound by 2030. This was [one of the reasons](https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/news/regents-to-vote-on-hillcrest-plans/) driving the construction of Jacobs Medical Center, among others.

When people create throwaways they can’t post here. They have to get 5 karma. Getting 5 karma is actually not a super easy or fast process.

Now we won’t get those severe or interesting or funny anonymous posts that actually make this subreddit more enjoyable.

This is just a stupid rule because this shitty moderator is obsessed with the fact that this place needs to be “fixed” maybe he should look at himself. 

2) Posts need a flair. For fuck sake, do I need to explain how useless that shit is? Who gives a flying fuck about a flair!  What if you’re new to Reddit just to join an anonymous UCSD forum and have to worry about not knowing how to add a flair? 

This rule and rule number 1 is not inviting at all for new users. Our subreddit won’t be the most popular UC subreddit after cry-ton’s stupid rules and decisions.

3) You can not post without including a description. WHO FUCKING CARES!?! This isn’t a professional forum for all students. A question is a question and sometimes doesn’t need anything in the fucking description box


4) Automatic Messages  - “pLeAsE rEmEmbEr tO fLaIr yOuR pOsT” 

Fucking kidding me man.


Who let this guy back as a moderator? Why is this subreddit now so uninviting to new users and now strictly how cryton wants it to be. This subreddit is turning to shit and I love this place. Can we please do something about this and him? Can we help restore UCSD to how it was before - without all this fucking drama?

This past Wednesday (Oct 16th), I got into an car accident on the intersection of Campus Point and  &amp;  Genesee Ave at around 6:20pm. I was going westbound on a Honda Civic toward UCSD on Genesee Ave straight through the intersection when a suv going the opposite way on Genesee Ave made a left turn on the intersection.

Everything happened so quick, what ended up happening was the suv crashed into my driver side door, all airbags got deployed, and my honda civic got flung to the right, crashing into another truck. 

Thankfully no one was hurt, and we were able to move our vehicles out of the way of the traffic. We called the police and everything. I talked to the gal inside the suv who crashed into me, she mumbled about seeing the green arrow, but said she wasn't certain when I told her it was green on our side, so it was not possible. 

I was stupid and in shock. I did not really ask what had happened and have the other people share their side of the stories, and I didn't really flag down any witnesses The police came, they didn't write any report since no one was injured, and told us to have our insurance companies resolve this situation.

After all that said and done, their insurance company is saying that the suv owner tried to claim that I ran the red light, and now it became words vs. words which the insurance company is still fighting it out.

I'm just wondering if there's any way to get hold of anyone who might've seen something at that time/location. Or perhaps some sort of vehicle dashcam or footages exist that can potentially corroborate with my story? I am angry and frustrated that all this is happening."

I am a first year in the Marshall res halls. Over the past few days I have called HDH twice, ResNet four times, ResLife once, and ITS once asking them for ethernet or better internet. This is after constantly getting constant terrible connection and often disconnecting entirely while gaming and/or streaming. These things are a big part of my life, yet living here so far (for 1 maybe 2 years) has made it very difficult to do these things. To some this may seem silly, “just don’t play video games” etc. so I’d like to reinstate that this stuff is a BIG part of my life. With that being said, the people I have called have all been useless. They [not even sure who “they” is at this point] have ripped out the ethernet in dorms for idiotic reasons and tell me to talk to so and so, who tells me to talk to them and I’m tired of it. I don’t know what to do about this and I don’t know what posting on here will do but I did need to vent. I dislike H*H and hope they choke on their money. It shouldn’t be this hard to get good connection when my family and I are paying xx,xxx a year to live here.

PRO is a club geared for those interested in music production! If you have a copy of Ableton, FL Studio, Logic Pro, Reason, Cubase or if you've only ever heard of these words and want to learn what they are then come on by. If you're a beginner producer and want to learn more but don't know where to go, then come on by. If you're a seasoned veteran bedroom producer then stop by and join our community!

While the club started out more for electronic music, PRO has come to branch out and cater towards other genres and interests in music. We have members here who specialize as instrumentalists/vocalists and can offer their knowledge and experience with recording equipment and interests in music outside of DAWs.

The DAW of choice for the club is Ableton and any meeting where we have lessons will be taught through Ableton. However, lessons are geared for general applications and information can be applied to all DAWs. There are members in the club who only use FL Studio (myself included), Logic Pro, etc.

We tend to share members from other music-based clubs on campus, the Musicians' Club and DVC (Deejays &amp; Vinylphiles Club). So there's an even larger branch of people you can meet!

The environment in the club is one that is meant to foster growth in all members. We encourage anyone of all levels, no matter how new or advanced you are, to feel comfortable and not afraid in sharing their music. Feedback and help is available to anyone during and after meetings at any time. Most meetings end with an open floor for anyone to share music they are currently working on or released.

My name is Stanley, I’m a 2nd year data science major going to SD Hacks this weekend! I’m also a front end developer for ACM, and I spent the past week writing a [hackathon guide for everyone going this weekend](https://medium.com/acmucsd/the-hackathon-handbook-85dfc3dd6b4d).

Here are some extra tips I have for everyone going tommorow!

* Everyone takes the hackathon at a different pace. If you have homework or a midterm, you can budget your time 60% studies / 40% hacking. If you decide to only hack, I suggest getting rest Friday night, and going all out Saturday night into Sunday morning.

* Go to workshops! ACM/IEEE/TSE have great workshops where you can learn about Node.js/IoT/Devops. If you see an ACM booth, feel free to stop by to say hi and play Smash!

* You can go back to your dorm, but it's going to be a struggle to get up and walk back. I suggest bringing a sleeping back/blankets/pillows

*  You don't have to come at the start of check in, but you can meet some cool sponsors/companies and have a chance to network with them

* You'll have way more caffeine then you need at the hackathon. Be sure to stay healthy by walking around and drinking a lot of water. Don't push yourself if you start feeling sick, there are a bunch of more hackathons across California.


Here's the full guide if you want to read the rest of it: https://medium.com/acmucsd/the-hackathon-handbook-85dfc3dd6b4d. This will be my 12th hackathon so feel free to PM any questions about hackathon tips/tricks! Good luck to everyone this weekend!"

I am a M.A. candidate in Korea. My major is teaching Korean as a second language. I just wonder by any chance you would like to be my participant or not.

I am currently conducting a survey for my Master degree. Its topic is how native Korean speakers and American Korean learners disagree with someone’s opinions in the Korean language. I got this topic from my personal experiences in US and Korea. I recognize the ways of talking one’s opinions between two countries are so different. So I decided to write a thesis about it and I am finally at a step to conduct a survey! right now I am collecting answers from Korean and Americans each. The information of survey and conditions of its participants are like these;

* Information of this survey

1. Online survey with translation in English
2. response to 12 disagreeing situations(there is no absolute answer or score)
3. takes about 15 -25 minutes up to your Korean ability

* Conditions of its participants

1. American who is in your 20s and doesn’t have a Korean background(Korean family, relative, born in Korea etc)
2. Currently lives in US or stays in Korea temporarily for a short period
3. Intermediate or Advanced level of Korean at a qualified language institute(like University or language center) OR If you have a Topik(3,4,5, or 6), it also proves your ability to participate in it

It’s quite hard to find those who meet with these in Korea. so right now I try my best to find someone who have interested in it. If you want to be a part of my thesis or have any question, feel free to ask me :) Thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

I am a sophomore and am almost done with my primary major (Japanese studies), and in the interest of both not graduating early and fulfilling some long-held interests, I've been looking into a double major. Specifically, I'm interested in earth science, marine bio, esys (earth sci), or esys (ebe).

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone in these majors tell me a little bit about what they're like beyond the vague descriptions on the major websites? And, being that my primary major is a humanities one and I'm not too mathematically inclined (passed 20a by the skin of my teeth) I felt like it might be in my best interest to just do a minor. I was strongly advised by my tuition-paying parents not to minor, since ""it won't help me in the future when I'm looking for a job."" So, what are the job prospects like for a stem minor vs a double major?"

If your degree will open career doors for you after graduation, you probably don't need to worry too much about tuition, since you'll have a good job, and you'll get your return on investment for your tuition you had to pay.

If you're really worried that your degree/experiences won't even get you a job, maybe you should reconsider whether or not going to college is the right option for you at this time.

Take the dance program as an example. I don't know anything about the job market for people with dance degrees. If you can realistically major in dance, and get internships/experiences that will land you a solid job after you graduate, then it's all worth it. If that's not a realistic plan, maybe dance majors should reconsider whether they're in the right place.

My parents have always told me that they'll pay for whatever I need in order to succeed in my future. I'm fully dependent on them and I'm not on financial aid. I am fully aware that I am speaking from a point of privilege.

But I don't understand why rising tuition in itself is something to worry about if you keep your eyes on the ball."

I'm a student from Madrid, Spain studying Mathematics and Physics at École Polytechnique in Paris, France. I have the option of going to UCSD (if I get accepted of course) for the first semester of my junior year.

After having read some posts in this sub, I have seen that you guys seem to have quite a big workload and the social life doesn't seem to be amazing (they might also just be memes). Coming from a school that loves sodomizing us with hundreds of hours of workload, I would like my semester abroad to be a bit more chill in order to be able to travel and stuff. So, do you guys think this is possible here?

Also, do you guys know/mix with exchange students (especially European ones)? If any European student reads this, please summarize your experience in UCSD.

Lastly, how's the campus life and how difficult is it to go to San Diego without having a car? I saw on maps that it takes about 1:30hrs to get to the centre, is it that messed up? I know that American cities don't really like to build infrastructure for public transport, and coming from Paris, where I completely rely on the subway to move around, I don't know if I'll basically be stuck on campus for the 6 months I'm there.

Just for context, the other North American unis I can apply to are Toronto and Georgia Tech. For now, UCSD is my fav due to its location (Atlanta is kinda in the middle of nowhere and Toronto is cold af).

Thanks a lot, people!"

Just wanna release some pressure, since there’s no one I can talk with in the reality. Now I am planning to apply for graduate school, but my gpa is only 3.0. I transferred from the college in my junior year. In the first year at ucsd, I did poorly and received two consecutive academic warnings. I wasn't used to college, and was breaking up with my ex. He was not willing, so he came to my door block me, not let me out, even hit me. On the final day, he blocked me again and again, then I missed the final of a retake class. btw that was not the first time he hit me, but was the last time fortunately. 

Anyway, I just had a really, really bad year, but it's all over. Now, my parents kept pressuring me to go to a kind of top 30 grad school. That’s driving me crazy. I've been losing sleep for days. Just now the midterm grades posted, I think I really useless, nothing i do is good enough, even though work hard. As a student with a low gpa and no internship experience or club activities, I feel inferior. I didn't want to tell my parents about my grades or that I couldn't go anywhere. I feel that there is no sense in doing anything now. Feel so anxious. However, if you see here, I really appreciate your patience. thanks!"

Today I woke up really happy and excited to check out the new market at Warren college.

I was ready to experience this once again, and to be comforted by the ice cream as it soothed away all my problems.

However... I was horrified to find out that Earls Market (warren market) does not have any ice cream scoops, or even ice cream at all! My disappointment was immeasurable and my day was ruined!

I want us as a community to take action and email HDH/Warren administration asking if Earls/Warren market can have ice cream scoops (like Johns at Muir does) once again! This is something I believe that we can accomplish together! Thank you comrades."

1. Remember to eat and sleep! Biggest thing, if you don't take care of your body your brain will suffer.

2. If you need help, ask someone. Parents, physician, significant other, friend, whatever it may be.

3. This is hard to say, but don't trust UCSD to fix your mental health. I haven't been to CAPS, but the one time I did try it was freshman year and I was in a really bad place, they said the wait was 3 months and it made me feel more hopeless. If you have insurance, see an outside psychiatrist or psychologist. If not, spend a dollar or two on one of the therapist apps to talk to a certified counselor. A $40 copay now is worth more than fucking up your head for a year.

4. Try to get out of the house. Proven fact that walking for 30 minutes increases serotonin and promotes better sleep. If you need a distraction, listen to music or a podcast, or play Pokemon Go!

To make a long story short: I want to take 16 units next quarter, and already have 12 planned (math 10B, chem 6B, warren writing 10B). Would it be manageable to also take BICD 100 at the same time as these courses, or should I wait until later? The only problem with that is that there’s not much else I can do this upcoming quarter, as some of my other required classes that happen to be lower division aren’t being offered in Winter, and I don’t have upper-division standing, so I can’t take courses for my major. My AP score passed me out of the BILD series, but I’m still nervous, as it would be my first upper div class. Please let me know! Really appreciate it"

I am currently struggling in a lab class that I have a W for already and so I cannot drop it. This class is eating a lot of time away in both stress and uncertainty from my other classes. I would drop the lab class if I could, but at this point I feel like I should take an F so that I can focus on my other classes. I am a senior, and my GPA is above a 3.0, but I was placed on Academic Probation (term GPA below 2.0) in Spring of 2019. I am worried that I may get placed on Academic Probation for Fall 2019 if I take the F. Does this mean that I will be put on Subject to disqualification, or do I have one more quarter to bring my GPA up? 

Also, I know that I should have planned better, but I only have a couple of classes left to graduate and saved the worst ones for this quarter, this is causing an immense amount of stress, and every class I need except the lab is only offered once a year. I was supposed to finish next quarter, but If I take the F, I would need to stay through Spring. I cannot fail my other two classes.  I don't know who to turn to, or what resources I can use, or even if I should take to the professor or academic counselors or what.  I am trying my hardest, but the anxiety of failing or not finishing is really taking over, and I just feel very isolated and dumb.

Congratulations to everyone here on r/UCSD for achieving 30,000 subscribers! This makes us the first UC subreddit to reach that milestone, if you care about that sort of thing. Not that I care, of course. ^(Eat our dust, r/berkeley! Woooo!)

There are two things that we're doing to celebrate this milestone.

Firstly, **the subreddit banner has been updated to a new default theme** to reflect this achievement. Witness the image of Geisel Library in all of its splendor! Please comment down below with any comments or suggestions you have about this new theme.

The second announcement might surprise some of you:

#We're holding a contest to determine which user can submit the best meme to the subreddit!

Over the next week, users will be able to submit memes to the subreddit to be considered for the contest. All you need for your post to qualify is to give it the ""Meme"" flair. However, in the spirit of fairness, **only a user's most recent submission will be considered a valid entry**. That means that if you submit a second meme post that receives fewer upvotes than the first, we'll consider the second submission to be your entry into the contest.

That's right, you heard me correctly: **the users will be determining the winner of the contest, not the mods**. Whichever user manages to have the highest upvoted meme by **11:59 PM next Friday (November 15th)** will be deemed the winner of this contest! The prize for the winner will be a custom user flair that denotes their superior meme-ing prowess. We're hoping to see a lot of great submissions over the next week!

Thanks to all of you who made the steps to become a member of this community and a student of this university. Here's to 30,000 subscribers!"

When I don't slack off I fail myself. The results are the same.

The professors and assistants are great. This is not the first time I tried my best but had some random health issue that severely hindered my academic work.

I used to have severe insomnia. No medication could knock me out. But now if I just lie in bed, I fall asleep without even realizing and wake up knowing I have to go to class.

I get dressed and ready on time, but I fail to go to class because of some stupid reason like losing my wallet and not having gas or some other reason that sounds like complete bs. That's only when I really try to improve.

Other times, I get ready but right before I go to class, I feel so insecure about everything that doesn't even matter. Literally so anxious that I contemplate not going even if I lost points.

When TAs of professors reach out to me, I either over explain because I feel like they won't believe me, or accidentally send gibberish because I am so exhausted while typing and doze off.

Then I feel more insecure. I'm dozing off as I type this, amazingly I didn't make typos.

I channeled all of my mental strength to go to CAPS. Went twice, they said call them anytime if I want therapy. Again, I use all my mental strength to call them and ask for the person because I think I needed therapy, they say she's not there and will call me when she is. Nothing.

I wasn't like this before my issue a few weeks back. I don't think school is for me. It never was.

Believe or not, so much better in other environments. They think I'm some exemplary student. Which makes me more self conscious because I'm not. I quickly tell them I'm not but they think I'm just being modest. It's a mind fuck.

I might not even be able to finish school due  to financial reasons. At times I wonder why I even tried so hard this quarter.

Thought I would finish this quarter with a bang even if it is possibly my last. Literally putting my health on the line so I can prove to myself that I'm capable. Obviously I'm not.

Anyone else fantasize about running away? I just don't know where. Some diner in the middle of nowhere maybe. Sleep in my car. My debt would stack up so high. Maybe I should change my identity. Get a new license with a new name. 

The past years when I ""tried"", it was for my family. This time it was for me. Didn't make a difference. Extrinsic, intrinsic motivation - what's the point, the results are garbage."

As per this info, the sections with Porter are specifically for students who are taking 141 in the winter as well. Those 141L sections is full but the corresponding special sections are not. The 200 spots in 141L are currently full but 141 is not (though they almost are). To the people who who are occupying those 141L spots, you are either 
1. enrolled in the wrong section, if you took 141 a previous quarter, you should enroll in eldon's
2. you first passed 141L, but are trying to save 141 for second. 141 is going to fill up before your second pass starts, and now we will have students who have the special 141L and not the special 141, and vice versa.

so if you shouldn't be there, fuck off and let the people that need to be in there be in there"

I've met some international students who are great at English, maybe their pronunciation and grammar aren't perfect, but I can totally have a conversation without having trouble understanding.

The other day I was at Panda and this girl in front of me spoke like 0 English. It took soooooo long for her and the worker to figure out what she wanted and held up the line for so long. Even the worker was trying not to show her frustration.

How would she even understand her lectures, let alone communicate with anyone of her professors/TAs or understand exam questions? Maybe she doesn't if she's a STEM major? How did she even get into this school? I know reading and writing is a separate skill than speaking and listening but her understanding of English and lack of knowing basic words really blew my mind. Are the English proficiency exams like super easy or something?

Imagine yourself attending university in another country with that level of knowledge of the language. Like how?"

Has anyone experienced this? I understand that professors don't know everything and that people make mistakes but the way that it's handled makes a difference...

Also, would it be wrong of me to show this professor an article on the topic and attempt a discussion about it or would it piss them off? I obviously understand that they know more than me about the field and I don't want to come across as though I don't believe this to be the case."

I am a transfer student that is trying to double major in Computer Engineering (primary) and Cognitive Science (secondary). I'm looking at taking ECE 45, 65, CSE 12/15L, COGS 1, 14A. 

My FP is actually right now, and the plan was FP: ECE 45/65 and SP: COGS 1/14A for SP (I get priority for CSE courses in second pass, so I'm assuming I don't have to worry about this class, but if I do have to consider this, please let me know). But now I'm thinking of switching it to FP: ECE 45/COGS 1, SP: ECE 65/COGS 14A. This is mostly because I am not declared a double major (as of right now), but according to my department advisor, I'll have to submit a form to both departments and get cleared once I have some classes under my belt. 

I'm not sure how full COGS 1 gets, and if I can get in, I can take pretty much any COGS lower div afterwards. On the flipside, my primary major is CE and picking 65 is the more obvious choice... BUUUUT I have to select a late lab section anyway and I am banking on the fact that it won't fill up as fast.

TL;DR: Refer to title.

Thanks!"

First, the protestors are asking for almost nothing. The Chinese government is tyrannical and oppressive on a massive scale and the only things the 5 demands cover are essentially that the one extradition bill be withdrawn and that a semi democratic sector of government become fully democratic i.e. fairly minor electoral reform. Both those causes are admirable, but this is a society where huge swaths of people live in dire poverty and not only do the protests make no mention of material circumstances or any fundamental change to the status quo, most of them aren’t even the same people facing these hardships.

Second, the media and US government were already looking for an opportunity to attack China. The protestors already have support from gigantic established powers because their interests align. That’s not a bad thing necessarily, but it does mean the cause of the HK protestors is going to be pushed disproportionately to its actual importance.

The problem isn’t that Hong Kong gets attention, it’s that other important events around the world that *don’t* align with powerful interests are being ignored. This laser focus on Hong Kong feels less like the “fuck you” the Chinese government deserves and more like playing into the hands of other established powers."

Hong Kong has extradition agreements with more than 30 countries, including the US, UK, most EU countries, Canada, India [Bloomberg, source](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-china-hong-kong-extradition-pacts/). So, the Hong Kong residents may be arrested upon the request of these 30 counties' governments, but immune from any crime committed in mainland China. Considering Hong Kong is part of China, the current situation is quite laughable. 

Hong Kong protesters have been drawing a lot of criticism because their appeal to violence as the solutions. Attacking police officers [NYTimes, source](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/13/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-face-masks.html), Blocking airport and public transportation [WSJ, source](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hong-kong-suspends-airport-train-as-protesters-mass-11567320687)  and storming universities [WSJ, source](https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-hong-kong-universities-become-battle-zones-mainland-chinese-students-flee-11573649430) are not among the democratic values I know of. If people are not satisfied with the government, they should vote them out and change the law through legal procedure. 

Contrast to public believe (in this subreddit), All members of the Legislative Council are directly elected by the people of Hong Kong, either through their residential district or guild. There is absolutely no excuse to bypass legal procedures (and thru violence on many occasions)  to forward their demands. The Hong Kong [local election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Hong_Kong_local_elections) will be held on Nov 24 and will determine 452 seats in district council. I ask you to support HK people’s right to vote in the election without fear of the ongoing street violence."

I visited UCSD a couple weeks ago to see some old professors and my old PI for letters of recommendations for grad school. While there, I remembered stories and rumors about Geisel. My girlfriend and I just went for it and had sex in Geisel 6th floor when I was back visiting. Loved the thrill, obviously not as comfortable as the bed, but the thrill was hot.

My friend Zack is a student filmmaker at UCSD. He is looking for extras for this Saturday to be in a his film called Faded Orange. It’s about a college professor who receives alarming letters from his future self that say that one of his students will commit suicide and it’s up to him to prevent it from ever happening. It may be integrated into a choose-your-own adventure style game with multiple scenes filmed that can be chosen by the viewer.

We are looking for background actors of any experience level for 9am - 12pm on this Saturday, November 16th. This would be a great way to be a part of a film and see the inner workings of a pretty ambitious production. Light food and drinks will be provided. You'll also get to be on IMDB (if you want)!

I’ve just been so tired lately. Both physically and mentally. I don’t want to live anymore. School is fucking rough. I am struggling to keep up with my classes. I’m so overwhelmed. It’s gotten to the point where it’s become too big of a problem for me to fix in the next 3 weeks or so. I just wanna drop out. I wanna give up. 

Relationships are hard too. It’s hard to make and maintain friends. I feel like I have a tendency to push people away. I want to reach out to people, but I feel like if I do try to hang out with them, they’ll think I’m annoying. I don’t want to vent my feelings to others either because I don’t want them to think I’m a burden. And I don’t want to be more of a burden than I am already. 

I fucking hate myself for being unable to control my emotions. I want to break up with my girlfriend because I don’t want her to put up with my shitty emotional problems. I feel like shit being unable to control my emotions and all I’m doing is thinking about myself when I get emotional with her. I don’t want her to worry about me. She doesn’t deserve this. But at the same time, I don’t know what to do without her. Will I die??? Who knows. 

I’ve been trying to find hobbies to keep myself busy. I’ve been trying to make friends, but I’m just tired of it all. I don’t want to kill myself, but if I were to suddenly vanish from existence, oh boy, I would choose that in a heartbeat. 

I tried getting help from CAPS like other posts here have mentioned, but they’re not available. So much for mental help from school lol

We are given excuse letters, but they aren't signed by school officials and carry far less weight (practically none). We practice and work hard, so why does the school not back our endeavors, it would come as no cost to them. College is about developing skills for our future and fostering academics, so why those involved in academic teams punished?

Disclaimer: I am by no means a therapist or life coach, I just thought it would be a fun idea and may help others.

Background: Over the summer me and my brother noticed that we had some social anxiety / fear of rejection. It wasn't to the point of it being debilitating but it was definitely hindering us such as being afraid to ask the waiter to remake a dish out of fear of rejection. We decided it would be a fun experience to seek out rejection to numb our fear by having a specific task everyday. Tasks could range from asking waiters for 10% discount or simply asking a stranger how their day was. While at first there were definitely awkward and nerve wracking moments, we just got used to it overtime as our confidence grew. With school starting and my brother going back to work, we slowly stopped doing these challenges everyday and I feel like my confidence has noticeably dropped so I wanted to start doing these daily challenges again. I just wanted to invite anyone might be interested to DM or comment below because I know the first step is always challenging to take by yourself. It is also much less intimidating and way more fun when you have a supportive group with you. I promise I'm not a weirdo and it'll be a fun experience!

I transferred in from Cal because of some great opportunities that were offered to me along with the fact that Med school is my main focus and goal. I’m a Cogs/Neuroscience major and academically UCSD has been fantastic, on par with Cal. I don’t want this to come off as another UCSD is “socially dead” post because this isn’t the intent. Obviously different places have different atmospheres and I’m just having trouble so I’m reaching out Is all. 

I’m struggling with the social transition, at Cal I had tons of friends who I miss a lot. I consider myself a very social person and I love interacting with everyone. My first week at Cal I had already started my own soccer team that played for the University league, I had friends who I would constantly be and enjoy time with. Here I feel kinda lonely, it’s hard for me to build connections with people because it feels like some are too busy doing their own thing which is understandable. It also just feels difficult in general because a lot of people already have their social circles. 

It’s not that I’m lacking effort either, I’m on a sports team as well as in a club and I’ve gone to plenty of parties/social gatherings here but I wouldn’t consider the people there close friends more acquaintances/general school friends. I really miss those connections with people and maybe I’m just being hard on myself because of how fast I was able to build them previously. Did anyone else have a hard time at first? 

Thank you all for taking your time to read this it really means a lot to me, I hope you all have a wonderful rest of the semester. Happy early thanksgiving if you celebrate it (I personally don’t like the ideals) lol but it’s good to be thankful for life and what it brings. Good luck on midterms/finals!"

Hopefully everyone is excited for the upcoming break as classes begin to break down into chaos before finals week.

I am excited to announce an exciting internship opportunity for all of my fellow Triton Data and Computer Scientists who have previous experience with machine learning.

We are a small team currently doing research in partnership with Columbia University on an exciting project that we hope to speak more publicly on later down the line.

Our ideal candidate is someone who has experience with classification, regression, feature engineering, and/or high frequency time series data collected over small periods of time. The samples we work with consist of around 200 points of data per second, with each sample spanning less than five minutes with a further focus on smaller intervals ranging from 5 to 30 seconds at the same frequency.

We hope to find a candidate that is experienced in Python and has a firm grasp of SciKit Learn (or similar libraries that can be used to deal with the aforementioned time series data) as well as a general understanding of, and basic experience with, a machine learning pipeline.

Candidates with experience in the following will be given special consideration:

* Creating and applying computer vision algorithms to pre-recorded video
* Neural Networking
* Eye tracking (Specifically with Pupil Labs)

Candidates must be able to commit at least 20 hours a week and be able to work remotely with occasional face-to-face meetings. All candidates must also have their own equipment capable of running heavy calculations.

In order to make all of this a little bit more interesting, any suitable candidates that are chosen and then carry out their job to satisfactory standards could be offered more long-term paid positions down the line as our project begins to pick up steam and support.

For further information, please feel free to PM me with a little bit about yourself and your background.

If you intend to apply immediately please have your CV and project history prepared and ready to present.

Finish the year off strong, Tritons!"

I got triple teamed by a midterm, programming assignment, and chem homework all due at midnight on the same day. 

On that day a friend in the dungeon dropped  a bombshell on me that most people my first year friend group dont want to associate with me much anymore because of undisclosed reasons, some just avoid eye contact with me altogether. 

That day at 12:01 (gotta make sure I finish my assignments before I lose my shit of course) I just had an enormous mental break down and passed out eventually. I overslept til 1 PM, still did my skincare cause fuck it I'm gonna be late anyway, and took the 41. When it passed by the VA. It was pretty crowded and a lot of the older folks had to stand.

I stood up and asked the elderly gentleman standing next to me if he'd like to take my seat, and a couple of other students around me did the same. He told me I should sit and that he'll be okay. I insisted, telling him my stop was coming up soon. He graciously accepted. 

A few moments later I saw him slip something into my pocket. I was really confused and at first kind of taken aback, not sure what he was doing. I reached in, it was 5 dollars, and a pack of pistachio nuts. 

""Have you eaten yet?""

""No""

He hands me a can of V8 vegetable juice.

""This will get you through the day. I always carry extra snacks just in case.""

It was such a small gesture, but this little bit of kindness really did help me get through the rest of the day physically and mentally. I don't know if he knows how much just sharing his snacks with me helped.

Tl;Dr an old Boomer offered me his salted nuts and cheered me up after a shitty week."

Doesnt even have to be coffee. Can be beer or glaucoma medicine.

Anyway, today I turn closer to 30 than I did last year!

I haven't celebrated my bday since in probably a decade, reason being I had exams 90% of the time on my bday and the rest of the 10%, my exams were either the day before, making me just want to sleep, or the day after, obviously cramming. The last and only time some friends threw me a surprise birthday party, which I am grateful for, but it was after midterms and I just wanted to crash lol.

But this week I finally don't have any exams since countless years! That's more than I can ask for lol

I'm not expecting anyone reach out, but those who say that they are lonely want someone to talk to, I'd be more than happy to meet some classmates (schoolmates) outside of class and see each other as potential friends. I don't have any friends because I left the country for 5 years (for various reasons - many of you guys can related I'm sure.

I see so many posts about being depressed and lonely. I know that all too well, the main reason I got out of dodge and now returning to school so late.

I'm thinking coffee, if any beer, JUST 1, I gotta wake up really early tomorrow If anyone is interested for a short convo and hour or two dm me!

For any older students who are trying to find someone as old or older, hello! Any transfers with no friends, hello Any undergrads stressed with school and want a different perspective on things, I might be your guy! Grad students too! The cool popular kids are welcome too!

I have no friends other than my roommates but I dont want them to feel obligated to get out of their way when they are busy so I didn't tell them. I never tell anyone anyway so it feels weird trying to make this arbitrary date a way to meet people on reddit lol.

Again I have no expectations, just being able to sleep if I want to or eat if I want to without worrying about exams is enough. I'm actually much more positive than this post may reflect lol. If anyone just wants to vent even or complain about how shitty \_\_\_\_\_ is. I'm down to listen!

If nothing happens, I'm gonna clean my room and sleep :)

Have a good day guys! Dont get soaked like me!

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: Haven't celebrated my birthday for years, never thought it was a big deal and kind of didn't want to, but now that I can, I have no friends and would like this to be an excuse to make some! I know you guys are busy, we can keep it short! From depression to advice after many life fuck ups, we can talk about whatever you want. Doing this at another arbitrary date just doesn't feel right lol.**"

I'm writing this because I feel concerned about what I see as an unfair prejudice some of us American students harbor. Specifically, I think there are uninformed and unkind stereotypes about Chinese international students that as UCSD students, that we should challenge. One of the common stereotypes I see is that Chinese international students only associate with other international students, and don't adjust to U.S. culture. My response to that is, of course that's how some of them act! They are far away from home in an unfamiliar and difficult school, which (as is often mentioned in this subreddit) is not always the most welcoming place. If as English-primary-language people born and raised in the U.S., we were dropped feet-first into the University of Shanghai, we would probably act in a really similar way. I think Chinese international students deserve empathy and understanding for acting differently from the average U.S. student. After all, people are different from each other, and all have their own challenges. That doesn't mean they stop being people.

I think many of us would feel differently about the stereotypes we hear and repeat if we were to actually have a good conversation with our Chinese peers. I confess that I believed some of these stereotypes in the past. But after connecting as people and having conversations about grocery shopping, or the dorms, or shared experiences with classes, my opinion changed because I saw that Chinese international students are just students like us, but from a different place and set of challenges. If we find ourselves buying into this prejudice — and that's what it is, prejudice, because we are pre-judging people we often have not met or known personally — then maybe our first response should be to ask ourselves some questions. We can ask ourselves, have we really tried to understand? Do we even try to speak to Chinese international students? Or are we simply being afraid of something unfamiliar? I know that I didn't ask myself these questions for a long time, and believed mean and often inaccurate stereotypes because of it. As students and as growing, learning humans, we owe it to both ourselves and our peers to interrogate these stereotypes."

TL;DR? Free photos for you, in exchange for posing for a photo on Wednesday, November 27th, from 10:00 AM until 2:30 PM. Held at Studio 140 inside the Media Center and Communication Building. First come, first served.

Friendly neighborhood /u/CruzedDude here with a fantastic offer. A free photo for you to do whatever you want. Yup. That's right: free.

Desperately need to update that aging tinder profile? Maybe the insta feed needs a different angle? Or just nothing better to do on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving break?

The catch is I'd like you to pose for a photo. The pose in question is incredibly simple in nature: give the camera the bird, while saying, ""~~Fuck you~~!"" or your favorite swear word.

You may be saying to yourself, ""This is quite the odd request. I wonder why in the world would this otherwise normal person, resort to taking photos containing such unpleasant language, and vulgar gestures?"" The answer to that is simple: a recent critique became just a little too heated. After talking to a grad student that I have better rapport with, we agreed that [this is how](https://youtu.be/kjS6bQ5OQ-o?t=40) most critiques in VisArts typically are conducted. We chuckled, but the conversation birthed this fun project.

So if you feel like you like to be apart of gallery, which I have no intention of reproducing beyond my own personal portfolio (treat this post as a form of promissory estoppel), stop by Studio 140 at the [Media Center and Communication Building](https://goo.gl/maps/E6ozwVyvBzVBfvqy7), on Wednesday, November 27th, from 10:00 AM to 2:30 PM. The format will be first come, first serve. 1 pose will equal a photo of your choice (more if there isn't much of a line). You'll get a RAW file via email. 

I want this to be clear: I will not be editing your photos for you. Every digital media lab computer already lets you do that for free with Photoshop, and I do have other classwork that demands my time.

Seventy Thousand American Dollars. This year broke the record for the most enrolled students at UCSD, and I think something along the lines of the most international students (don't quote me on this) or at least a very high percentage.

So why do we still lack basic shit like Wi-fi and parking?

When people complain about parking, there are always those who mention ""what's the big deal"", ""the walk isn't that bad"". And yeah, I agree that with walking for 30 mins and leaving early isn't too bad. It gives me a chance to exercise and listen to a podcast..if it were FREE. Paying $30,000 to be forced to park elsewhere, or pay even more to barely find spots is worth complaining about. I get some of you guys are looking this as a half glass full kinda situation, but I don't think some of you realize how much $30,000 is. If everyone becomes content with this, we'll soon pay $45,000 to walk and listen to a podcast.

Anyway, where are all our funds going? Is there no possible way to see how much of our budget is going towards A and B, etc?

This might be a dumb question but I really am curious: why can't we vote on things like this? I feel what we can vote on are pretty irrelevant for the most part. 

It's not like we're asking for valet parking for each student either. Just a paved lot with some paint on it. And whatever it takes to make wifi better? What are you supposed to do to fix the wifi problem? How much would it cost?

Is that financially too far fetched?"

I'm a Transfer student, so most of the content is pretty familiar to me, but it seems like most of his lecture is spent going on tangents about unrelated and unimportant subjects or ranting about the ""terrible"" education system that doesn't focus on learning and instead cranks out a bunch of people focused on memorizing, and how most scientists and Doctors are actually huge idiots.

Another core component of class is him answering student questions, with a usual pattern of asking a question, asking the student if they actually know what they're talking about, asking the students to explain themselves, making the students look stupid in front of the whole class, and then kind of answering the question, but not really, along with kind of giving the student a concession for asking a question.

During Friday's lecture, these two points came to a head as Bozinovic started going on a tangent about how electrophoresis gel can be made from seaweed heated up in a microwave with a buffer and saw a girl nodding her head no to her neighbor. He asked what the two students were talking about and she said the question she was asked was ""Why is he talking about this and how is it at all relevant?"" At this point, he got extremely upset and started asking what percentage of the class had performed gel electrophoresis on DNA and a majority of the class raised their hand. He then deflected and asked how many people knew what a buffer was in gel electrophoresis and the exact mechanics of how it worked and less people raised their hand, and for the rest of the class, he directed a lot of his comments about the rest of the lecture toward that student, who eventually left.

Maybe I'm just naive and not used to Research-based Professors, having come from Community College, but in my experience, the Professors are usually respectful to their students, encouraging them to ask questions and not feel stupid for not understanding concepts, and very clear about they will and won't accept in the classroom. Bozinovic, however, seems hypocritical, since his whole philosophy is ""Students should challenge professors and actually think"" and then he gets mad if people call him out and don't like his teaching or lecture style."

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently taking Math 20C with Eggers and Math 18 with Tamam. I'm a new math major, so I'm not too familiar with the usual math department grading scheme. According to both syllabuses, each class is graded on the regular scale (i.e. 100-97 is A+, 97-93 is A, 93 to 90 is A-, etc.). However, both of these syllabuses also mention that there may be a curve applied if the class average is lower than expected. I'm guessing that the curve is only used in very special occasions and I shouldn't depend on it?

&amp;#x200B;

I ask because I really want an A in these classes, but I didn't do too hot on the midterm. In particular, I think I got like a 12/20 on the Math 20C midterm when the avg was closer to a 16/20. Homework will end up being around a 18/20 at worse for me. So for me, it all comes down to the 60% final. If I study super hard for it and get a 100% or really close to it, do you think there's still a chance for me to end up with an A-? I assume the final will be tough and the avg is around 70%-75%, so if I get significantly higher than that, that should boost my standing in the class and help me get a higher chance to getting a good grade in the class, right?? Just worried that a bad midterm score will set me back from getting a good grade, because technically I've already lost 8% from my midterm and most likely 2 more percent from homework.

&amp;#x200B;

Please anyone who has taken these classes in the past or is a math major...would really appreciate any clarity on this matter. Thanks!"

My original plan was to take AP bio next year (already took honors chem/honors bio). But then I considered taking gen bio 1 at my local community college over this summer (any thoughts on how the two classes compare content wise?). I thought it would be good so I could focus exclusively on it for a few months. Also I would save a slot to take either AP environmental science or AP chemistry next year (I need advice for that too haha).

Anyway, for math I would take AP calc ab next year in 11th grade since I skipped a year of math (currently in honors precalc), and then take calc 2 at my local community college over the fall semester of my senior year.

The university I plan to apply to (UCSD) and the college (Muir) only require two quarters of writing and three quarters of political science (both could be done in a year or two). If I skipped gen bio 1 and math 10b (aka calc 2), and also finish the writing and political science courses in two years, would I complete my pre med in 3 years as opposed to 4?

If you could give me any sort of advice that would be amazing. I know it might be a little early for me to start thinking but after seeing my brother get screwed over, it’s never too early. Thanks again :)"

Amidst the holiday season today is Giving Tuesday and I’m helping UCSD camp Kesem raise money to send over 100 kids to a free camp this summer. 
Camp Kesem at UCSD is an organization that provides a free week-long summer camp to kids whose families have been affected by cancer. Since the organization provides a free camp for the kids, we rely on donations to support an event like this. Every $325 made allows for 1 kid to attend camp so please help support Camp Kesem at UC San Deigo put on this yearly event. I’m hoping to raise $750 this year. 
We will be on library walk all day today selling baked goods, collecting donations and having lots of fun. There is also an opportunity drawing for some fun prizes down below. 

Any donation helps and please visit the link below to donate to my page to help support all the wonderful memories this organization provides.

e5p3kk,Advice on ochem series from someone that's passed it,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/e5p3kk/advice_on_ochem_series_from_someone_thats_passed/,nctdy,1,2019-12-03 14:41:51,4,/r/UCSD/comments/e5p3kk/advice_on_ochem_series_from_someone_thats_passed/,General,"I took the 40 series last year and I just wanted to share some stuff I've learned upon the way that helped me pass (40A: B+ 40B:A- 40C: A) . I kind of lucked out by having lenient and good professors, but even then the averages for midterms and finals ranged 60-75, so don't be discouraged if your scores are low, curves are generous. Ternansky and Hoeger I heard have averages of like 40.

For people that are beginning to take it, I can't recommend drop in tutoring at Geisel commons (1st floor) enough. I didn't go during 40A and in retrospect, I would've struggled a lot less if I did. The tutors, to my knowledge, need to have passed the class they're tutoring for with at least an A-, so they know the content pretty well. In general I've learned a lot from them, and it's less intimidating than going to office hours for me because drop in tutors are underclassmen, and don't give condescending vibes like I've had in experiences with some of my TA's. Drop in tutoring requires no appointments, so you can just come by whenever you're free, and the schedule is posted online of when drop in is available. Sometimes there aren't tutors available for ochem, but I've found that other ochem students come and it's easy to collaborate and work on problem sets, homework, generally anything together. 

On top of drop in tutoring, if you have space in your schedule for it, Oasis is a good option as well. My oasis instructor didn't mind students that weren't officially enrolled in the workshops to attend since it's a small group, so try messaging the workshop leaders in Week 1 asking if they're cool with having you come in if you don't get accepted.

Listen to podcasts if they are available to you just to help go over concepts, and youtube videos (the organic chemistry tutor, leah4sci) etc helped me a lot as well; they broke down topics into easy to understand sections. For websites, masterorganicchemistry is the best. I can't speak for their study guides because I never bought them, but the website has a separate blog section that's free to access that I used a lot. Khanacademy, I used a little bit but not much because they don't go over as many topics as organic chem tutor does, but it's there if you need it.

Ochem is a hard lower div, and it'll take a lot of effort and grinding, but you definitely can do it!"

It was a gift from my brother; it's my first and only board; it's physically perfect for me in every way; it has so many memories attached to it, including getting me through a really rough time in my life. I could describe pretty much every detail of the board, including who did it and how. If anyone knows anything, please contact me. Last time I remember having it was last Wednesday, Nov 27 in the Bioengineering building."

But has anyone else gotten a similar scam? they say it can also be for grant overpayment debt, but ive never gotten anything like that before?   
i think only last year i had to return $3k because my profile said i was off campus but i was actually living with parents, but i returned that to ucsd and it was all fine. has anyone else that has had to repay grants to ucsd for whatever reason gotten this sort of mail before?

i think it's a scam because financial aid usually messages you directly, and idk why they would send something like this to my dad when he's never been to college or gotten loans like this or anything

If for some reason there isn’t enough context here, it’s prob in my history.

I’m an active lurker here, and am living on campus for my sophomore year. I just needed a throwaway because i have friends on this subreddit that I don’t want knowing about this.

Long story short, my mental health has hit a new low. I was in therapy for around 2 years, but when I came here, my issues resurfaced, even stronger. Facetiming my therapist didn’t make any difference and being that I never really connected with her, i stopped talking to her. I live on the East coast, so communication back there on a regular basis is tough enough already.

I’ve met with my provider, caps, and the emergency line but they’ve all ended with “you’re not actively ending your life so there isn’t much more we can do except check in later”.

I was told they could recommend me to “Betterhelp” the only therapy covered by SHIP apparently? Looked into it, and even called to find a specialist but was just dissapointed by the lack of options.

There’s only 5 days left in the quarter, i’m just trying to make it through but it’s harder and harder

I feel like I’m really running out of options. PLEASE RESPOND TO ME IF YOU CAN HELP ME. 

I’m a first-year student living in an off-campus apartment. I moved in originally in the middle of August. I did not expect things to be very fun at school here but I’m in a much worse state than I imagined I would be in at this point. I’m just really lonely :-) In high school I enjoyed my life. I attended parties frequently and had a lot of friends. Then I had a very rough senior year, and now I haven’t felt this lonely since I was 13 (that should sum it up well hopefully). I was really looking forward to coming here too. I thought I was gonna have a lot of fun and make the best of it and meet as many people as I could. That’s what makes it all the more painful for me to be in a situation like this. 

But now you have a decision. Because I am gay and because I am not effeminate, most people are un inclined to give me the ‘benefit of the doubt’ in almost any setting. All I’m saying is that I’m no stranger to fun experiences. I also actually believe that I am an extrovert after spending my entire life identifying myself as an introvert, and I had hoped to figure that out for sure this year but have been given no proper chance. IF YOU’RE CHILL, LIKE TO HANGOUT WITH FRIENDS, ETC., THEN PLEASE MESSAGE ME THIS INSTANT to plan a hangout for the soonest possible date... if this post actually gets any respondents I’m hoping maybe I can just have people over for New Year’s Eve (since I’m doing nothing as of now and am very afraid of spending that holiday alone). First years are preferred but all ages welcome of course. We can do whatever, I have a car so you could come over or I could come over, or we could hangout somewhere, or we could just study at school together. The fraternities are sanctioned to party while the rest of us are left to rot, so I think it’s perfectly respectable of me to throw this out there in public. Hopefully some of you will be enticed by the thought of my apartment. 

I use cannabis (MEDICALLY so I can say it), adderall (I need study buddies; I’m prescribed adderall not addicted &lt;3), and I’m not saying that I don’t use alcohol. BUT MOST OF ALL I need guy friends (I need to know more straight guys because I know too many girls). Most guys write gays off instantly and assume they won’t be able to connect well in any conversation. I can almost GUARANTEE that no matter how heterosexual you are we should be able to get along. It’s also sad that I even have to say that, but realistically speaking, straight men have much greater control over the reigns of parties than gays do. My social life was happiest when I had my alpha male friends behind me, as painful as that is to say. But if you are a cool person then message me no matter what :) I try to never dislike people until they dislike me (blatantly) first. 

WHEN YOU MESSAGE include your Snapchat username (or Instagram I guess OMFG). I only say that because I am sometimes bad at replying on everything else. Also please ignore any of my posts before this I was only trying to get five karma. 

Your friend, at least hopefully, 
-Sam"

In my Math 20E classs, I had a final yesterday from 3-6pm. Idk how but for some reason my dumbass  thought the final would be from 6-9pm. So I arrived at around 5:30pm and had to take it then. My professor gave me some extra time so I had around 50 minutes to do a 3 hour test. 

Thing is the test was pretty easy, I was well prepared for it. So I was able to finish 9/15 problems in that time span. I probably got 100% or close to that on that portion

But I've been thinking about this lately, and now I'm super stressed about what to do. Thing is I am most likely going to receive a C or C- in that course. While I did really well on my second midterm, I did really bad on my first one and the professor doesn't offer midterm replacement so my grade before the final was an 83%. I haven't done any calculations but I believe that with 9 questions right( 60%) I'll still receive a C in the course.

I don't know if this is a good thing or not. A C or C- in that class would lower my gpa, and that would really suck especially cause I know the material. I was thinking of maybe emailing the professor about just failing and giving me a D in the course. That way I can retake the course, and get an A and that wouldn't affect my GPA. I just don't know what would look worse a D/F in a course and retake with an A, or a C. In addition, I'm a sophomore and currently applying to internships. A D and F would temporarily lower my gpa pretty badly. I'm not sure what's the best thing to do. To just accept the C or ask for a grade reduction so I can retake the course? What do you guys think? Any help would be appreciated!"

I am trying to acquire some insight on the differences between Management (Mgt) and Economics classes here at UCSD. I have read the description of classes online, but it doesn't really say much as to how classes are structured/what the classes are like. If one person can describe their current or past experiences in Mgt and another person for Econ then I compare them. 

I am assuming Mgt classes have more writing and group activities and Econ is more math-heavy. (I could be completely wrong, but that's the point). How well are you guys who took math10 vs 20 series doing in Econ rn? Those are some starting points for discussion but anything related can be helpful.

I will probably try an Econ or Mgt class Spring quarter for myself, but unfortunately no lower division classes overlap between IB and Economics."

I was forced to withdraw from a class this quarter because of two sick days and 2 tardies, so I only finished 9 units. I need to take 16 units to maintain 36 units for the year. I'm enrolled in some anthro class but it's also upper div, sounds time consuming and not sure if interesting. It sounds like it's ill-advised to take another bio course. It seems my only option is to take some BS class, perhaps P/NP. 

I've already looked at the bio electives and none of them will work. Most (of the few that are offered) have a prereq I haven't met yet. Or timing doesn't work.

I hate math, engineering, physics so don't suggest those! Is there something fairly interesting in which all we would do is watch videos and discuss material in class? No essays, not much reading."

I know some of you are tired of not having fun and you are my audience. I know some of you think it's stupid that only frat men (in 2019) are sanctioned to have social events, most often complete with bad music and a 10:1 girl-to-boy ratio. I am a first-year and I moved into my own apartment in August, right across the street from campus. I was extremely excited about coming to this school and meeting new people. Now I'm halfway through the year and my mental health is at a literal all-time low. *I could rant about the school and the student culture, and I definitely will in the future if this post flops.* But for now I'm just posting this FUN WANTED sign in case there's anyone at UCSD who's social.

Basically the main thing I'm looking to do is meet more people who like to party. It sounds extremely stupid but I basically have no other way of describing it. I went to a Catholic, all-boys school for high school. There I was friends with the group of guys in my grade who liked to 'party' and **I would prefer it if I didn't peak in high school.** So if you're even remotely cool please PLEASE message me! I know for a fact that my grades would be much higher than they are now if I didn't spend every Saturday night at home alone.

Lastly here's this. :-) I have met only one person this year (a girl in Marshall) who is my actual friend and who has sympathy for me regarding this. Other people I have talked to stopped contacting me almost immediately after I told them. These reactions have made me very sad but I'm hoping that there are some of you out there who are fun in parties *and* in politics. I am planning to transition, surgically, to a female as soon as possible (within the next four months). I will tell you more if you actually wanna be my friend, but my interest is *preserving* my social integrity. I am a tall, cool, well-dressed and decently attractive man as it stands right now. That's what I was in high school during my mental health/social life/good grades/happiness 'peak' so I figure that is the best way of me finding my footing at UCSD. I have no intention on changing my appearance until it can be done so 'all at once,' basically to make myself as biologically female as modern science allows in as short a time frame possible. Please note too that I am not very effeminate. The reason I say this is because I have no guy friends here and I really wanna make some. As sad as it is to say, most guys tend to write me off immediately without even trying to notice all the things and tastes we have in common (particularly in music). *I actually say* that I get along better with guys, but am friends with mostly girls because I'm forced to be. Most people actually think I'm 'straight' when they meet me and I SAY they just come out as homophobic once I come out as gay.

Other assets include being able to drive and having a car; being a stoner (it's medical so I'm allowed to say that &lt;3); having a fake ID; having an apartment to myself; being prescribed adderall (so I consider myself a good study partner, and BEG you to hit me up for a study date if you are also prescribed it); and a UNIQUE sense of humor.

&lt;3 PEACE OUT &lt;3

\-Sam

***IF YOU WANNA MESSAGE:***

You can be really ascetic and nerdy and incel, the least fun person on Earth. It doesn't matter because we'll still probably be able to get along, because I can be friends with pretty much everybody, and the people I MAKE CLOSE PERSONAL TIES WITH are historically quite random (there is one thing that unites them all, but they vary widely in terms of background/appearance). Please do not be flakey and be prepared to hangout more than once every four or five months. That seems to be a norm at UCSD (with literally everybody, not just me). You should include your Snapchat username if you have it. Specifically, I'm planning on having people over to my apartment on January 11. If you wanna hangout at all during winter break lemme know. Also, if you're a fellow first year, maybe include your major and/or the classes you're taking this quarter. And last this CAVEAT: We launch our friendship forward as quickly as we want it to go. I realized long ago that the kindergarten mentality of becoming friends 'bit by bit' day by day is exhaustive and overdrawn. We are adults, let's act like it. *If we get along together in a one-on-one context, the chances of us not vibing together in the future are slim.* I say this because this seems to be another huge thing with the students here, or at least the ones I have encountered. So when you first message me you can include as little information about yourself as you'd like, but the more you give me to go on, the quicker we'll be able to realize any *close* friendship bonds that we may have."

i was wondering if y’all had ideas on suitable backup majors, or if i should try transferring to somewhere like berkeley at the end of soph year to see if i can get my major there (how hard would that be, and how are they at bioeng compared to us?) 

also ik it’s probably a long shot but if there’s any way i can redo a class for a better grade or something, or if they look at grades for later classes in the series more than the earlier ones (for example if i got an A in chem 6B would that be considered in their decision to accept someone into the dept more than my B in 6A, since it builds off of 6A anyways?) id love to know, thanks

Then others write about it here, but are afraid to report the incident; this one I can kind of understand. Then some other tell the poster they should have reported the cheating. And then there's the general consensus that international students who cheat should be severely penalized.

Of course, weirdly enough, there are nuances and context to what cheating is, which exists, but every AI incident would have to require a lawyer (a legit appeal system doesnt sound too bad, but not familiar with the process that exists).

The mind fuck is the one that claim they have been falsely accused as if the world is to get them, and other who consider admitting go a false accusation (mental health issues the only reason this sounds remotely reasonable).

What do you guys consider tolerable and intolerable cheating?

I've come across a thread that was about someone using I clickers for their friend. Not a big deal right? If my classmate were present for all of his Iclicker points for a course, he'd at worst be getting a B-, but is on the verge of getting an F. Yes, I clickers.

Because of the variability of context, cheating shouldn't be allowed at all. I never went out of my way to accuse somebody, but I know it hurt my grade as well (curve).

Where do you guys draw the line?

Do you guys report if?

Anyone accuse/accused of cheating willing to share their experience?

In a perfect world, I really wish nobody did. I can't and haven't cheated on exams because I just can't. The fear of getting caught doesn't help, but that doesnt even go through my mind during exams. 

Googling a hw q because I am trying to finish it on time and paraphrasing it in my own words is probably the furthest I'll go/went as far as ""cheating"" at uni.

Do you regret your decision at all, and do you think that poster had a point (high admit rate -&gt; less resources for each student -&gt; impact education quality)?"

However, before the fall quarter began I went through something devastating and got major depression and I barely got diagnosed about two weeks ago. I wasn't able to focus as much as I wanted to, so I ended up failing two classes, and dropping one and getting a W on my transcript because the class I dropped was a lab. The only class I passed was my writing class.

My major is neurobio and I failed chem 6a and math 10a (the final screwed me up). Im worried about multiple things, my GPA, having to repeat pretty much an entire quarter, having two F's and a W on my transcript, not being able to receive financial aid because I failed two classes and now my GPA is hella low, being put on academic probation.

The chem 6a classes all have a waitlist, and so do the 10a classes and the 10a classes conflict with my BILD 1 class (which I need for my major and college requirements, and atleast this way I'll be able to get back on track with my BILD courses), so I can't drop BILD 1 to put myself on the 10A of 6A waitlist.

For now I have, CAT 2, CGS 105, FILM 87 as my enrolled courses and COGS 3 (for my college requirements) waitlisted. 

 I can't change my major because it's something that I not only want to pursue, but need to pursue. Neurobio is a path I have to stick to.

Can anyone provide me with advice?"

Grading couldn't be messier. Even if you're passionate about and enjoy reading law, avoid it as it will just demoralize you. It has the hardest curve of any course i've ever heard of because going by raw scores the average *and median* fails every exam. You won't fail (because of the curve it's almost impossible to) but your GPA will take a hit that just isn't worth it.

Of course, it's not impossible to do well in the course if you want to overachieve, go to office hours every week and develop a relationship with the profs/TAs to understand. In a class of 200 that simply isn't practical for everyone especially not for students who don't live on campus. It also shouldn't be compulsory to go to office hours to do well in a course.

I could go on about the faults of the course, but for the initial post i'm just gonna leave what I wish I would've seen before I enrolled in 104A."

&gt;Some students will notice that their grades have changed on Canvas. It happened due to AI violations for some of the homeworks.

Apparently some people got blank grades, I did not. However, one of my grades changed to 0 on a PA and this dropped my grade 4%, which ended up being a letter grade. I'm really bummed about that. I still have a grade on Academic History, it's not blank or anything, and I've received no further email other than the general one she sent to the class. I have reached out to the professor.

What's going to happen here? To the best of my knowledge, I didn't copy or look at anyone's code (or give mine out) at all throughout the quarter. This has honestly made me feel sick since one of my PAs turned to 0. It's just such a foreign experience that I've never even been near to combined with the stress of getting grades for everything else. I haven't been able to relax at all over break.

Is this going to be a formal thing? Since I got a grade, will this still be submitted to AI or can I just plead with the prof to take the L on the assignment (it sucks because I didn't do anything, but I don't know anyone who's ever had a good experience with the AI office)?

Do you think it is a good idea to take the two organic chemistry courses that is required as per [plans.ucsd.edu](https://plans.ucsd.edu) in the summer and be done with it before Fall 2020? Specifically, I am thinking of doing CHEM 40A over at San Diego Mesa College for the first part of summer and CHEM 40B here @ UCSD during Summer Session 2. 

I have to do it like this because I have to take MMW 12 and 13 next year, which by far are the hardest of the sequence, so I do not want to do MMW and OChem at the same time. I have nothing else to do over the summer so I can focus 100% of my time on these two courses. 

Someone knowledgeable would you please tell me if this is a good idea? Also if I were to go through with this, will this affect my upper division classes negatively in any way? 

Greatly appreciate your thoughts and have a nice break everyone!"

2. What does it mean when a class hasn’t released a final grade yet?

My chem grade isn’t showing up on my academic history and there isn’t a submission for the final on Gradescope. The grading normally took a while for that class as it’s rather large, so I’m just assuming that they’re just not done grading yet. Although, other posts make it seem that all professors have a deadline to submit final grades. Do you think that they’re just not done grading? Or are there generally other reasons that grades don’t get released on time?

I think this suggests that very few professors here enjoy teaching - if the students honestly believe that a professor who is so eager to be done with teaching is one that is passionate about teaching and really cares...

I'm transferred from a community college. There, the professors are solely there to teach. For the most part, they teach because they care and they are very available (office hours 4x per week).

On my transcript there'll be 5 As and 1 D in Math 1B which I guess is MATH 20B for y'all.

I have anxiety/PTSD and have been on antidepressants for about a year. I didn't do well in Math 20B despite studying for 200 hours throughout the quarter because I needed more time to finish the exams. I conceptually understood the material and knew how to solve the problem, but needed more time because of my fight or flight response. I know I would have passed the class had I had more time on the final because I knew how to do the problems but didn't have time to do them. 40 questions in 2 hours, multiple choice with no partial credit. Obviously not having partial credit deflates grades. 

Not sure how this will affect admission to UCSD but it's looking bad for sure.

I was just wondering if anyone else has been in the same boat of not doing well b/c they weren't aware they needed accommodations?"

**Homeless HEAL** is a nonprofit student organization started by UCSD premedical students. Our mission is to empower the homeless and underserved communities with the knowledge to make better health decisions and improve their health outcomes.

If you believe in our mission and would like to make a difference in the lives of people from these communities, we encourage you to apply.

**Our organization is unlike any other organization at UCSD**. We work **directly** with the homeless and underserved populations and **provide them with the resources and the information** necessary for them to gain stability in their life and strive towards a healthier, happier life. This is a great organization for pre-health students who wish to work with the underserved and homeless communities **beyond a shelter or a charity event**. This is also a great organization for those interested in attending graduate school and wish to make an impact on many lives (**all** of our former members are currently in medical, veterinary, nursing, and other graduate schools). If you are interested in working with these populations in addition to developing and teaching health-based curriculum, please take a look at our website: [https://homelessheal.org/](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhomelessheal.org%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR328UbGHZWcKonyQTfLD_4y6j71MbK_QGHZXolBYsZ5C7hFfxi6CWIiIFA&amp;h=AT162cnQYliy1srMxhfXWCXvG6AlYbCKVS_m8jZwUgGo_Z9Nes_Ber7PPNXUzcBSrUAv9hjcRrf8NumlfiAmPWe2-b3kBk8zsWJGZ2Pjt5H2hmGfARGot8uBi_2nMlhwHDEXYk0Jo0c5k66uE-t5sQ)

I remember reading this reddit page for info about the university a lot while I was still at CC, so I want to give some insight to my fellow transfers looking to attend UCSD.

First off I'll give you guys some background about myself. I transferred from a CC in LA with a 3.6 GPA as a Pharmacological Chemistry major. I completed IGETC and all of my major pre-reqs except for physics. However, I did complete the 1 series equivalent at CC but the pre req for physics was the 2 series equivalent. I am now currently taking the 2 series. I chose Revelle college as my first pick since I would have the least amount of GE's to complete once I transferred. **This will vary depending on your major and whether or not you completed IGETC.** The only extra class I have to take is a DEI class which is a university requirement, not a college requirement.

I would like to acknowledge the UC Socially Dead myth. IMO UCSD is not necessarily ""socially dead"", rather I found that a lot of students here are a lot more focused on academics rather than partying. If a party school is what you're after, this school may not be the best fit for you. I'm not saying parties don't happen, you just have to put yourself out there more and make friends with the right kind of people. Making friends wasn't an issue for me, I made quite a few already. You just need to talk to people and be social in classes / study groups / study areas / etc. All of the people who complain about how socially dead this school is probably just don't have good social skills to begin with, but thats just my opinion... I had no issues. Maybe except for that one time I sat next to some girl in lecture and she promptly moved to another seat... :(

Now I'm going to talk about my academic adjustment from CC to university. The biggest and most obvious difference is classroom sizes. It's likely that you are going to be taking classes with around 350 students in a big lecture hall. Big change from the 30 student classroom sizes of CC. At first it was a bit strange, but you get used to it after 1-2 weeks. I would say the biggest downside to these big lecture halls is that you don't get much 1 on 1 with the professor unless you go to office hours. Most of my professors paused lecture for a moment for any questions, so asking questions is not an issue unless you are scared to talk in front of 350 students. It's not that bad, trust me.

Another thing that I needed to adjust to was the pace of the quarter system. It's fast and you need to stay on top of your shit. My biggest piece of advice is to not let yourself fall behind, not even a little bit! The work will continuously pile on, if you don't consistently complete the work you need to do, well, best of luck to ya. As long as you stay on top of everything all the time, you should be fine. I never felt the need to go to office hours this quarter, but definitely go if you start to struggle with your classes.

The thing I dislike the most about UCSD is the parking situation. Buying an S pass is exactly like buying a ticket to a music festival that is guaranteed to sell out quick. The day the S pass drops, you try to buy it at 12am only to find that the website is crashed. You stay up till 1am and the site is still crashed. You go to bed and tell yourself you'll buy it in the morning, but when you log on the next morning, they're already sold out!! I had the S pass for Fall but I missed my shot in the Winter. It was nice having an S pass once I got my parking routine down.

Having an S pass does not guarantee parking. It took me two whole ass weeks and almost being late to a quiz to really get a parking routine going. My biggest piece of advice is to learn all of your parking options before the quarter starts, and also learn when they fill up on average. That way you minimize the risk of being late to class. On your first week I would recommend getting to school about 1.5 hours before class starts, that way you wont stress if you can't find a spot right away and you can start to plan out your parking routine. Of course if you live on campus then none of this should be an issue since you guys get SR permits guaranteed... cause I mean people who live on campus and **can literally walk to class** need the S pass more than the students who have to drive to school every single day... right?! 

Anyways, the things I like most about UCSD is how STEM oriented this school is and also how much research opportunity there is. You will probably meet a lot of like-minded students who share the same interests, both academic and social. You will meet a lot of cool professors and cool people. If you do well and put yourself out there, you will likely find some research. I was lucky enough to get into a research lab starting in Winter that focuses on organic synthesis and drug discovery, so I'm pretty stoked about that since I love ochem and I want to get into pharmaceutical R&amp;D after grad school.

The campus location is also beautiful, right next to the beach and stuff. Plenty of places to eat on campus that are good. Lots of places to study. Overall campus is good and I have no complaints (besides parking). Getting around isn't too bad for me since I skate, but the campus is pretty big so if you're walking be mindful of the time. There are also buses that you can take to save time.

On a final note, for any transfer students who are nervous about how well they will do simply because they are transfers, here's what I have to say about that. I'm sure you have all heard about the stereotype that transfer students aren't prepared / less smart simply because they went to CC. Of course there may be exceptions depending on the level of difficulty of the CC in question, but for the most part I feel that transfers are well prepared. I have found that the difficulty of courses at CC were either more difficult or about the same as the equivalent courses at UCSD. 

For example, my lower div biology class at CC went into more detail than the some of the same topics covered in my upper div biochemistry class at UCSD. Also, I have helped some new friends with their ochem this quarter and found that some of their understanding of mechanisms is limited (CHEM 40A-B) whereas at my CC mechanistic reasoning was highly stressed and very helpful to understanding the material. Often times I have heard that professors here will not go over mechanisms in detail which i feel is **VERY IMPORTANT** to understanding organic chemistry.

Overall what I'm trying to say to my fellow transfers is don't stress too hard about being a transfer, you are likely well prepared! As long as you work hard and consistently here at UCSD, you should do just fine. I got a 4.0 my first quarter, took CHEM 114A, CHEM 143C, and PHYS 2A. Work hard and you will see results!

Thanks for taking the time to read this. UCSD isn't as bad as this subreddit makes it out to be sometimes. Work hard, be proactive, put yourself out there, and you will likely be happy and do just fine."

Like in many current situations, I did a rant to transportation office(they didn’t respond) and tried to find ways to obtain S permit.

Having a “D” permit, honestly, isn’t all that bad (except the fact that it’s crazy overpriced and $50 extra for S pass is definitely worth it)

Here’s why:

If you have class that start at like 10, with a D permit, you can arrive on campus around 9, find parking, and still make it onto campus. You get to sleep more as opposed to S permit, where you would have to arrive before 8 to secure a spot. And note that there’s going to less S spot because they’re removing them from Hopkin for some reason. After 4, you can park anywhere with the D permit. 

D permit is inconvenience, but there are lots of inconvenience in life. Try to be as positive and make best of the situation!!"

I take the bus (an hour commute). By the time I’m near UCSD where the busses begin to fill up with students (8 AM) it doesn’t even fill up all the way. However, if I go around 10-11 yes the busses fill up. 

It’s a small inconvenience to wake up a little bit earlier to reach the bus so they don’t fill up (which is a huge complaint that busses are always full). Especially for people that live near campus and buy parking permits...like why the bus stop is so close to you lol. 

Even when I did drive, I drove early enough to find free parking. I understand for people that commute and live far that buying a permit is way easier, but I know so many students that live close and buy permits because the bus is “inconvenient” thinking they save time driving - when that saved time is wasted finding a parking spot. 

Granted UCSD still fucks students by taking away parking/limiting permits, but theres hella students that don’t reaally need to buy one."

I saw on the policies that I can request for documentation which led to the flagging, and I can’t wait to see it. But I still haven’t received an email from the AI office, and I assume I won’t until Jan 2. This is ruining my break, and I’m absolutely fuming. 

I didn’t do well in the class either. My PA average was like 75% and my final grade was a ~70%. 

Has anyone dealt with AI when they were certain they didn’t violate standards?"

My GPA in computer science is currently a 3.3 and will most likely finish with a 3.3-3.4. and my Math GPA is a 3.75 and will most likely finish around a 3.7 or 3.8.

Probably because I had to make up work. So I didn't mind at all until I read about NR eventually turning into an F.... I don't wanna bug the professor just  yet, because he clearly told me that it will be late, and I told him that it's fine and to take his time.

I'm now concerned because I found out that after some time, the NR turns into a failing grade. Doesn't specify how long until it does tho. 

For those who aren't aware of what NR is:

&gt;""NR"" = An ""NR"" means ""no report."" An ""NR"" can only be assigned by the instructor. An ""NR"" is not calculated into the student's GPA, except for certain careers where it is converted to an ""ED"". An ""NR"" is subject to lapsing to a failing grade (""ED"") for certain careers.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; ""ED"" = An ""ED"" means ""unofficial drop."" An ""ED"" is calculated into the student's GPA as a failing grade. 

I will email the professor soon, don't wanna bug him when he's celebrating the holidays, especially because he clearly told me that he will report it late. I'm just concerned it's going to turn into an F.

Anyone else experience something like this? How long does it take for an NR turn into a failing grade?

* On academic history, it doesn't show anything. Grade is left blank.
* Only found out because I ran the degree audit and it says NR.
* Doesn't show up on late grades"

Podcasting can still be up to the professors, yet certain discussions like Warren Writing where your participation is majority of your grade, can still remain mandatory. Say, if x% of the overall grade is based on participation alone, attendance can be chosen to be mandatory by the instructor.

There are plenty of classes that are podcasted, yet I-clicker points count for every lecture. That would also save you $70. Shouldn't knowledge of the material be far more valued than showing up and listening to the lecture live? I can't even stand my favorite sporting events live sometimes. Plus, many of them choose to sleep through lectures anyway. Why should reliability issues regarding transportation, rather lack of, be a factor in determining your grades? If the professor chooses to share important information before the podcast to reward those who make it to lecture or punish those who don't, such as relevant material on the final exam, then be it. The students' loss. (Of course location and other material should be posted somewhere in case of a student happening to miss class when crucial info like that is announced).

The whole ""legality of funds"" for parking argument doesn't matter imo, because it was the school's choice to get rid of S spots and designate more A and B spots. I'm sure the school can choose to open up more S spots without running into legal trouble.

Just a thought."

Does anyone know if Phil 8 still works as transfer credit for Hum 4 at UCSD. If not does anyone know which course is the easiest to complete at Foothill in order to get credit for Hum 4?

I’m a new transfer and I completely misunderstood how enrollment works. I thought we were able to add and drop classes until the quarter starts after our second pass, which is what I’m used to from community college. 

I feel so stupid because now I’m in a class I literally can not ever be on time for because 1. it’s way farther than I thought from the class I have 10 min before it, and 2. it now conflicts with my work schedule, and I can’t afford to not work those shifts. I spent forever trying to find another class that I can do, and after hours of moving other parts of my life around and searching for alternative classes, I finally found one that has 20 available seats and would be perfect... only to realize my fuck-up. 

However, it says the official add deadline is Jan 17th on WebReg, and last quarter I know my roommate was able to drop one of her classes and add another one a week into the quarter, so I guess I’m just wondering how all of this works? Can anyone please shed any light on the options I have? I’d really appreciate it!"

As the title probably suggests, I have great interest in transferring to UCSD. I was originally accepted to UCSD as a freshman for biochem but chose davis as an animal bio major as I had great interest in becoming a vet. But after my first quarter at Davis, I have developed great interest in neurobiology and have decided to change career paths to somewhere in the neuroscience field. 

I know UCSD is world class in terms of cognitive and neuro science so thats why I have great interest in transferring. But another huge factor for me is simply distance. I am from SoCal and UCSD is so much closer to home than davis (obviously) and it is becoming a financial burden with all of the travel costs to/from davis. 

However, I have heard it is near impossible for a person to transfer from one UC to another. I have great interest in majoring in Neurobiology at UCSD and I don't know if I have a chance in successfully transferring."

last quarter, i’d been having issues with the marshall amazon lockers. at first, they’d been working perfectly fine and i got all my packages. however, after a while, things changed. 

on amazon, it would say “out for delivery” on the progress page and then say “delivered” in the details. despite saying the package was delivered, i wouldn’t receive a code for the locker. this happened twice before i stopped using the amazon locker altogether. unfortunately, this also happened to two other people in my suite! i got refunded, but i just really want my packages. 

one of my suitemates called amazon support and they basically just said that they couldn’t really do anything and gave a refund )-:

i tried to order from amazon this week because i assumed that it would be fixed by now, but it looks like the same thing is happening again. i was wondering if this has happened to anyone else lately!

I scrolled through the rest of the classes, and this appears to be the case for almost every single CSE graduate class. There’s a waitlist for even the core classes required for graduation. 

So ... what’s happening? Does the department place everyone on the waitlist for the first few days, before enrolling them, or is it really just that poorly managed? I can’t believe people are paying graduate tuition money and not being able to take the courses required to get a degree. 

Is the graduate program also being over enrolled and understaffed?"

The club would have a primary focus toward educating others on pressing health issues  and healthcare problems that the LGBTQ+ community faces, as well as providing resources to gear premeds that are interested in becoming providers to combat health disparities. Things I considered doing are inviting health professionals that have worked with the community, possibly organizing some way to gain clinical experience with risk assessment counseling plus rapid HIV testing in cooperation with Student Health Services, mentorship with medical students who are part of the medical school’s Prime-HEq program focused on health equities, community service involvement with tabling for sexual health like SHA or volunteering at events such as the AIDS Walk, professional development with resume advice and attendance at the national LGBTQ Health Conference.

COGS 17 is a pretty rough class, especially for an under division course. Given the competitive nature of the class, I wish I had more help back when I took it. I had to really bust my ass for the A, but I thought I would give some tips as well as share all materials I used to study for the class. 

TIPS

* You can actually do fairly well by just studying directly from the lecture notes, slides, and assigned homeworks
* Pay attention to what terms and concepts are being underlined in the lecture notes. If there's a whole bullet point or chunk of text with no highlights, it is just there to increase your understanding and connection with the material - you will not be tested on it.
* SOME DIAGRAMS ARE VERY IMPORTANT  - In the second midterm particularly, majority of the test is just being asked to draw diagrams of certain processes / systems. 
* For the lecture slides, not all pictures and diagrams are important to know for the class. Use your discernment as to what seems important
* BUT there are also some things on her lecture slides not mentioned in the outline that you will need to know!
* There are some things you will want to take the time to properly understand, but trust me some of this stuff will make no fucking sense and you'll just have to memorize it. For bigger concepts try to have a basic understanding, but for some smaller things (for example the Raphe Nuclei is located in the Pons and releases 5HT), you just gotta memorize it. 

The way I studied for each midterm

1. I had a very busy and conflicting schedule, so I had to take a lot of notes and learn a lot outside of the lecture. It didn't help that when I took this course, it was at 9pm.  To take notes and learn the lectures, I would pull up the lecture notes and lecture slides split screen and try to write info AND draw diagrams if it helped me visualize what was going on
2. A few days before the test I would revisit the material. Then I would do the Homework, which is basically an outline for everything that you will be tested on. I would try to use my notes to complete the homework. If I couldn't find it in my notes I would pull up Johnson's lecture outline. I would only use the internet as  LAST resort.
3. Finally, once my homework was done, I would spend the whole day before the test reviewing quizlets with all the terms and definitions. These quizlets were pretty big and daunting, I'm talking 200 - 500 terms. But I swear if you just go through it a few times and review the ones you struggled with, you'll be ready for the test. 

\*For the final, when Midterm 3 and the Cumularive Final are in the same testing period, I would reccomend studying for Midterm 3 first and putting atleast 3/5 of your energy into that. It is also worth more points than the cumulative!

&amp;#x200B;

MATERIALS THAT COULD HELP

* QUIZLETS!  
it's pretty easy to find these online but I'll attach the ones I used anyways :) [Midterm 1](https://quizlet.com/261213210/cogs-17-midterm-1-flash-cards/) [Midterm 2](https://quizlet.com/265872491/cogs-17-midterm-2-flash-cards/) [Midterm 3](https://quizlet.com/346838104/cogs-17-midterm-3-flash-cards/) [Cumulative Final](https://quizlet.com/306355244/cogs-17-cumulative-final-flash-cards/)

&amp;#x200B;

* VISUAL NOTES

So as I mentioned before I love drawing diagrams, but not all of us have the time / capabilities to draw good diagrams for notes. Basically I tried to combine only the relevant content from the slides with the outline, so that way I could turn those two into one.  My visual notes are here 

[Visual Notes &amp; HW](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-OQQNwpDE_nbOCfemmiFr0BeNaEHF15c)

&amp;#x200B;

* HOMEWORK ANSWERS

I do not recommend copying homework answers, but I am providing these as a guide. It is included in my COGS 17 folder  above as a study aid.

My current plan is to retake the chem series and 1 physics class (even tho I don’t get credit, it still shows on transcripts), and then replace bio with upper div coursework. Is this a smart move? Also, would it look bad if I took a couple chem classes during summer session? So frustrating how we are basically punished for doing well on AP tests and how we can’t choose to claim credit or not.

If I get in as a transfer applicant (big if), and if I also get into sixth college, will I be housed at the new Torrey Pines housing? Or will I be placed in some specialized transfer housing? I know that transfers won't be placed in the village starting next year, so if I won't be housed in the new sixth buildings, where will I be?"

The website's syllabus says that homework is worth 15% and that late submissions aren't accepted, but nowhere on the website does it say what the homework is or where we can find it. It \*does\* says we can submit it on Gradescope which implies the existence of homework, but the Gradescope doesn't have any other assignments listed (which is half relieving, half terrifying). The calendar on the course website doesn't indicate that there is any homework even due, and only posts due dates for pre-labs for the third lab onward.

If anybody in the class is around here, I'd appreciate comiseration or any actual information about the fucking phantom fifteen percent of my grade."

We were going to give her money; however, she did not want to exchange money on the spot despite claiming she had venmo. 

TLDR; She hit us with a bunch of stories and excuses. She was even at Fireside Lounge yesterday claiming she lost her bus pass, per my other friend's story who also encountered her.

Please spread the word so that, if it is a possible scam, she doesn't finesse anyone. Also if her situation is real, then we can do our best to help her out."

&amp;#x200B;

However, UCSD is pretty strict with the waitlist deadline (for no reason too - just arbitrary) and because of these reasons, I won't be able to get in a class I need AND by next week people will drop anyways, making open seats.

I feel that this is pretty unfair and was wondering if it's possible to try to change the policy for the department, which is at least letting the waitlist extend to the drop deadline (making the deadlines the same, so as to help waitlists). Either this, or actually increasing size for classes that are in high demand..."

It might just be this year or quarter, but UCSD has been treating me so well (surprisingly). I just picked up a job on campus for the EHS department, I just do mundane shit but it’s good pay and I love my bosses and coworkers. My student org is so amazing and I’m so grateful to meet everyone in my major, upper and lower classmen to talk about our futures, do hw together, joke around and everything, I love them. This school has brought me out to meet so many different people from all these ethnicities and backgrounds, like I shoot free throws every noon next to my apt and people come by just to shoot with me or play a quick game. I’ve met dudes from Australia and Singapore and everywhere just playing ball with them, and they enjoy it here so much, too. The friends I’ve met here from my org, project team, and just in classes are friends I can never replace, and I love all of them.

There a lot of challenges when it comes to academics, but I was never a hard worker until college anyways lol. Somehow I now enjoy getting all my hw done and studying, it makes me feel productive. Given I’m still not the smartest in math or physics, I love the engineering program here. So many great faculty members I’ve established relationships with and the courses are hard af and I don’t do the best, but I enjoy trying to learn it and just being out here.

While there are underlying issues in parking, housing, and just administrative decisions nobody agrees makes sense, I’m grateful to be here. Not everyone gets the opportunity to go to college, and I appreciate my parents so much for sending me here when they didn’t get that chance. Being here means career opportunities like I never could’ve imagined, and professionally developing myself to one day be successful in the industry is what keeps me going (hopefully I get to that point lol)

All in all, thanks for being such a great community, I couldn’t do any of this without all the amazing people who suffer through undergrad with me. We have a lot to be grateful for just being at UCSD.

TLDR: UCSD is pretty cool, thanks everyone"

I'm sure you always do your best to build the perfect image in the minds of your professors and employers.

BUT that does not give you the right to act like arrogant assholes when judging other people's hard works. I've met and seen older people who hold more intelligence and influence than you ever could, but they are genuinely kind, humble, and open-minded to others' shortcomings. At a school that is proud of its inclusiveness, your action did not convince me that you have great empathy, but instead horrible superiority complex.

However after using the app myself, I found that the frontend design is very unattractive and makes it really hard to schedule/enter availabilities on mobile.

I created a new version of when2meet called Vailable ([vailable.io](https://vailable.io/)) that keeps the best parts of when2meet but has a cleaner frontend and more functions. It's totally free and allows you to view people’s availabilities to choose the best meeting time. I've already migrated a lot of Yale students to the platform and it has been working great so far. I'm really excited to see this app potentially help the UCSD student community as well.

If any of you have any suggestions or features that you would like to see implemented. Please let me know!

I'm trying to figure out if it's something that's possible or if people are generally closed off to the idea. I yearn for a sincere relationship where you grow with your partner. I want to have a good time, learn together, build each other up, explore, laugh, cuddle, resolve differences with quality communication, bond intimately, etc. I dont want it to be superficial and temporary, I want to make an investment. I'm tired of witnessing the general population (in my age group) lack desire to be monogamous and committed. I mean, to each their own, I dont judge. It's just extremely hard finding someone who shares my desires of the real thing. Seems like most people just want to focus on themselves and not go out of their way to make things work. I'm aware I'm generalizing, this is just my anecdotal experience. 

Speaking for yourself, would you be willing to commit to someone and make it work even if it's logistically difficult? 

E.g. I'm from LA and will be in SD for 2 years and unsure where I'll end up after. If I'm in a genuine relationship, I would be willing to make it work and compromise where my partner and I lived. Is that not the common consensus? Do people just want to study with their heads down and/or have casual flings and date when they're more settled? If you find something worth fighting for, would you choose not to?"

ITS has known the WiFi on campus has been a major problem, especially in Fall Quarter 2019. We want you guys to know that these WiFi issues have not gone unnoticed. For the most part the most widespread incidents such as the campus wide outages have been fixed, but we know that there are still some problem areas. Our network team has been working tirelessly in solving a lot of the problems that have been cropping up in places such as lecture halls, Price Center, and Geisel. The main thing that we want to say is that all your feedback, all the emails, calls, and word of mouth are extremely important in helping us deal with these problems. These provide our network team with an idea of which locations are major problem areas, and helps them troubleshoot issues that they may not have seen without you letting us know.

We want more direct ways to receive feedback, so ITS will be coming to YOU in the form of the new role “Tech Ambassadors”. We’ll be posting ourselves in various WiFi troubled locations like Geisel and Price Center. Look out for a technician in a bright orange shirt! So please do not be afraid to come up to one of us and let us know the problems you’ve been experiencing. 

Finally, this thread will double as a WiFi AMA. If you have any questions about how the WiFi works, why the WiFi was having so many issues last year, and what UC San Diego is doing about the WiFi right now, comment below! We will try to respond to as many as we can between today and tomorrow."

Maybe it's because I didn't do the reading so this was my first time gaining the information, but Tuesday's lecture for Chang's MMW 14 was inspiring.  His talk of *Discourse on Happiness* peered into my soul. 

I have always lived my life in intellectual pursuit. Knowledge and learning has filled me with great joy.  Yet, I've struggled between that desire to pursue knowledge and wanting more. For some reason lately it's felt like I can only have one or the other, as if love will somehow stifle my independence.  On top of that, as I'm about to graduate I've been having so many doubts that I've done myself a disservice choosing a career in ecology because I'm risking economic success and stability.

Hearing about Emilie du Chatelet's *Discourse on Happiness* and learning about her life has given me hope that both are possible, and that I'm not crazy for taking a risk in pursuing my passion. She talked about the importance of using our knowledge and rationality to gain independence and happiness, but also about there being more to happiness than just intellectual pursuit. Chatelet emphasizes the importance of taking risks to pursue our passions in life in order to reach happiness. She put my many feelings into words and I feel so seen and comforted.

I don't know. I'm probably just high off the romanticism after having watched Little Women and Anne with an E, but this lecture felt so needed. Thanks Professor Chang!"

We’ve just glanced at each other couple of times. So at least he knows my presence in the world. 
And after few days later I ran into him I think we share paths to our classes on Tuesday and Thursday. 
Anyway I don’t know what to do. Looking at the recent similar post there was a comment that asking someone’s number never works out in the end cuz it is so easy to fall into awkward situations. 
Maybe I just have to let this thought disappear naturally? I don’t know why but he is just my type I remember I was so shocked when I first saw him I kinda feel shallow for that. 
Y’all Just share your experiences of failures at asking numbers so I could feel discouraged and stop thinking about it lol"

Here's a link to the UCSD page about the shuttle [https://basicneeds.ucsd.edu/food-security/grocery-shuttle/index.html](https://basicneeds.ucsd.edu/food-security/grocery-shuttle/index.html)

The specific event is the Target back to school event. It's the second featured on the site. I've also copy pasted the details below. I think this is a cool event to help students save on grocery costs.

On Saturday, January 25th, Target will be hosting a special back to school event for UCSD students from 12 PM - 6 PM. Hop on our Grocery Shuttle so you don't miss this event!

During my writing sequence, I went to the writing hub quite often for my essays and found it as a really helpful resource! I also did well in my writing classes, so I have the academic requirements fulfilled. I'd really appreciate it if some of you who know about this job could kindly give me some insight :)

For those of you who work or have worked as a writing hub tutor, how is it overall? Do you enjoy it? Are your time slots usually filled or empty around certain times? Do you often find yourself able to get some studying in while there are no appointments? Is it a manageable part time alongside many other extracurriculars in your experience? How about alongside TAing? Was it competitive to get the job? Anything else you'd like to add?

Thanks so much in advance!"

And while we are being honest with ourselves, the Chinese Government is not known for being very credible with it's statistics presented to the world. I would assume that China is lying about how many people are infected and it's preliminary death toll. This being said we all know that a.) The deadly Virus has Origins in China, and b.) UCSD has a large International Chinese student body. But let's chill with the memes targeted at this group, it's honestly blatantly racist, instead of having this racist view take steps to prevent yourself from getting sick. Read up on common symptoms of this new Virus and do not hesitate to go to the doctor if you are feeling sick, wear surgical face masks if you really fear getting the Corona Virus (correctly of course) and always wash your hands. 

If you want more information about the Corona Virus and current CDC stance, seek it [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html) . As of today there are no vaccines for this, but [here's](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/about/prevention.html) is the CDC's advice on Prevention / Treatment.

I hope that all of you have been making it through the Winter Quarter without much issue.

This post is a friendly reminder from the moderation team here at r/UCSD to keep a level head in the midst of the current situation surrounding 2019-nCoV, more widely known as the Wuhan coronavirus. Some users on the subreddit have expressed concern that the virus will end up spreading to UC San Diego due to the relatively high number of international Chinese students who live on campus. In response, here are a few facts about the ongoing situation:

1. The risk of infection is largely dependent on a person's exposure to the virus ([source](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/summary.html)). This may sound fairly obvious, but it's worth keeping in mind. Speculation aside, there haven't yet been any confirmed cases of the virus throughout the San Diego area, and the CDC's risk assessment of the virus towards the American public is, as of right now, low.

2. A vast majority of the deaths caused by the virus have been among the elder population of China, many of whom already suffered from pre-existing conditions ([source](https://time.com/5770924/wuhan-coronavirus-youngest-death/)). It's still a concern to anyone who catches the virus, but it seems to least affect those who are otherwise healthy and able-bodied.

Please don't misunderstand us and dismiss the virus as a concern altogether, however. It's always good to be cautious, especially when it comes to disease outbreaks. Washing your hands, coughing into your elbows, and practicing good hygiene are always good habits to have. But be careful not to let your concern for the situation cause you to panic.

So I've been wanting to start exercising and I have always been interested in swimming. I know there are open swim hours but I haven't gone swimming in a long time so I'm pretty slow/unconditioned. 

For people who go to these hours, is it busy enough that I would just be in the way of other swimmers? And also are there lockers available and do I have to bring my own lock?

Maybe I'm just over thinking but I'd like to start practicing swimming and stuff.

Thanks in advance."

Post your emails either in comments or private message and I will create a Google doc where we can organize schedule, logistics/carpool, and what everyone wants to bring. Also, we can organize a meet up before the trip to get to know each other. This will be a memorable experience and a great opportunity to make new friends at UCSD! 

Dates: we leave either Thursday (2/13) or Friday (2/14) and come back Monday (2/17) which is a holiday so no school. 

If we get a large enough group and can find a nice lodge, we can do that. Or, we can camp (but it'll be cold at night and camping might be limited). 
I'm thinking Yosemite and some surrounding areas."

However just as a heads up for anyone that doesn't know, especially for extremely popular shows/games/movies, companies will actually go after people torrenting on the University's network. 

Warner Bros is especially cracking down hard by leaving tracking bots on their most popular movie, which as of the moment is Joker. These bots disguise themselves as other clients and trace your IP when you torrent.

I get it, we live in a society and we don't wanna pay for things. But, Resnet isn't out to ruin your day, they have to comply with publishing companies to protect us from lawsuits. So please go support Joaquin Phoenix in theatres or share an HBO account with your friends."

I saw you walk out slowly and then linger in the parking lot. I wanted to come say hi but I kind of wanted you to do it instead. I figured you might not be interested. And maybe you wouldn't have been unless I came up to you and charmed you, which I probably could have. :p

Oh well. Maybe you'll never see this. In case you do, just know that I think you seemed like a catch and I hope to run into you again someday. You are super handsome and seemed unique. 

Wishing you the best."

Homework is due the day of the midterm. A student raises the concern of having to study 4 chapters, do the homework, and not be able to review the homework solutions that is due on the midterm, that the midterm will cover.

So meyers does a ""pro gamer move"" and makes the homework due a day earlier and includes it on the midterm instead of just moving this material to the next exam.

Its apparent he doesn't belong at UCSD because every class he complains about ""how easy"" it is now, and how much harder college used to be. Always saying sarcastic responses like ""for all you smart ucsd students"" But then piles it on with being an absolutely terrible lecturer who wrote a book with numerous errors we have to use, that doesn't even cover the material he asks for in the homeworks. 

If i want to spend all class learning a useless derivation that nobody ever uses, i'll switch to a math or theoretical physics major. We came to engineering to learn how to apply these formulas not watch him make mistakes, mumble to himself, make it harder on us, and them screw us on a midterm."

Exam notes

Dear all,

The first midterm will be held on Feb. 4th, Tuesday, 9:30- 10:50 am in WLH 2005. The exam has 4 problems.
Please keep in mind that:
1. It’s a close book exam
2. Use pen if you want to be graded. (Answers written by pencil would not be considered for grading)
3. Cheat sheet, printed copies of lecture notes and textbook are not allowed in the exam
4. Calculators are not allowed for this exam
5. Any electronic devices are not allowed during the exam.
6. No equations will be provided in the exam paper. You need to memorize them ""

Wow! I'm so glad that this is preparing me for my future career! Having to memorize 30 formulas, do all hand calculations, derivations, etc!

Seriously. Who do they think they're helping, teaching, or enriching by making us memorize equations and not use a calculator. And he explicitly WILL NOT PROVIDE ANY FORMULAS. It peeves me when professors do this because seriously. Who are they helping learn this way? It's unrealistic of real life. It's a nonsensical measure of how much we know because it's simply a game of memorization. We can do 20 more examples and be able to really understand it, and have the equations for backup after all the practice, but instead we've got to spend hours memorizing something, as he would say, ""trivial"" 

He doesn't remember a single formula after 40 years teaching and studying this, yet we're required to memorize them all.

This is some grade A bullcrap."

I’m basically doing all the work plus answering her endless questions about the concept/procedures. Even if she was to do something, that’s me telling her what to do exactly or she just doesn’t get it. Like to add 10ul of A and 5ul of B while handing her the pipette(adjusted) level of details.

I think she’s just ultimately confused about everything since she spent her first two labs just really trying to understand dilution yet she still doesn’t get it. So every time when the lab starts, everyone is working on calculation and she just pretends to write something, and leans over when majority is done and ask me “What are we doing?” And when we are falling behind, she doesn’t even think about catching up, but just keeps asking questions about the steps we were doing hours ago.

I’ve come to accustomed of her asking me at the beginning “which lab are we doing today”, yet I see her every time in lecture, which is worse. Because when I know you just sat there and listened through the entire lecture about everything for the lab and still didn’t get it, you must be absolutely clueless. And recently it’s gone worse since the material is getting a bit more complicated that I really need someone to discuss with, and I know troubleshooting/explaining our results are challenging. But when I asked her if she wanted to do some of the steps she just said “I don’t, you can do it”.

I have no problem with people who are slow, as a matter of fact, I’m slow too that I can’t multitask at all aka doing simple tasks like pipetting &amp;answer her questions at the same time. And I’ve benefited a lot from her, since she really hammers a question down, so through explaining things multiple times I really understand the concepts better. But it’s been bothersome that I’m doing all the work and has no one to discuss things with except the group next to me. And I really don’t want to be mean to her but it’s been increasingly hard to put a smile up for her, when I’m burying a massive rant. 

I definitely do not come off as entitled or dismissive, I’m just incompetent so I want someone who’s better than me to help me as well. Coz I think those who understand better definitely are more capable of helping her, they probably don’t feel impatient or frustrated like I do. So all this rant is entirely due to my own incompetence, but still, what should I do?

If you have been in situations like this or you are in the opposite position, what’s your thought? Any suggestions? 

If not, I still appreciate you to have finished reading my long and wordy rant!"

Because of that I have decided to donate a bag full of clothes I no longer use and I really think people should follow suit :) Every once in a while though they do have gems, for example I found a portfolio case (one of them big ones) and inside a pencil bag full of art supplies (charcoals and things like that) along with some lightly used sketch books, all that together only cost me 5 bucks ! I saw a lot of kitchen supplies too and some basic dorm stuff. Also, they give out/rent out (?? Not sure) business wear for those who have a job interview and can’t afford new interview attire which I thought was really nice 

Their prices aren’t inflated also, I bought some pants for 50 cents ! And a lot of the prices often vary from $2-$5.

I look as average and normal as everyone else on this damn campus but I feel like people look at me like I’m from mars. Idk anyone ever feel the same way?"

Hey y'all, it's happening! 

I just made the google doc with all the information. 
I am requesting that you send me your UCSD email to my inbox. The reason I am asking for UCSD email is because someone brought to my attention that this subreddit is open to the public and we are trying to ensure the safety of UCSD students. Your email will be confidential and only viewed through the google doc with other UCSD students -- guaranteed. 

Please read the previous reddit post(s) for information.

I'm thinking we will leave early Friday morning (2/14) and come back Monday (2/17). Monday is a holiday, we're off. 

In the google doc I have created a portion where we can bounce ideas about which campground to stay at. I want everyone to be able to have a say but ultimately we have to decide on one as a group. In any case, it'll most likely be up north, likely around Yosemite.

I look forward to meeting you all and having this amazing experience together.

**Please, positive vibes only. No drama and no drinking/getting high to the point that you become problematic. Do what you want, just be responsible. I'm doing my best to organize a safe and fun trip so please be considerate. We will be looking out for each other.**

Can't wait!!!!!!!!"

So basically yesterday the jewelry vendor near the Stussy tent offered to bring another set of the earrings I was going to buy but in a different color and gems with the promise that I would buy both from her at the special price of $20 (originally $15 each). I agreed and came back today but she lied about the ""custom"" earrings and gave me a totally different set so I pointed out that the ones she was showing me were the same ones she had the other day and were not to my liking so I was willing to buy the original pair for $15. From this point she started murmuring things and I felt bad so I picked a smaller pair similar to the ones I was going to buy and asked her if they were cheaper (surprise, they were not). I asked if it was okay to haggle and she agreed to this and also offered to remove the tax but got annoyed when I asked to lower the price from $28 to $25 since her original ""promised"" total price was $20. She mentioned that her earrings were made from fine gold and gems so I asked for a certificate to prove this and she started raising her voice to say that there was no need for that because she would know since she made them. She also said that there were no others like hers in the market and no one could reproduce them, as well as that if I didn't believe her or bought anything from her then I should try to make them myself. 

To be honest, I was getting annoyed and asked her if she thought I could get a similar shape if I twisted wire into a hoop and intertwined another wire with gems attached to it. As soon as I said this she yanked the one pair of earrings I was originally going to buy (and still was interested in buying regardless of her comments) from my hands. She basically grabbed my fingers with a ridiculous amount of pressure and pushed my hands just so that she could grab it. Like wth lady, you could've asked me to put it down or maybe even shown me cheaper things to change my mind or try to justify your lack of certificates. She didn't stop there, she started removing all the earrings she had on her table as if I was going to steal them or copy her idea (but I mean she did suggest it?). When I asked her why she was doing all of this when I was still interested in buying the pair of earrings she yanked from my hand, she started cussing at me as if I wasn't there, so I just told her to have a nice day and left. 

While I understand that hand-crafted jewelry takes time and effort, I personally think that raising your voice at customers and breaking physical boundaries is not the most effective way to increase sells. It's also kinda sad to have seen her act so nonchalant about her actions because there is other people that could go after her business or react either verbally or physically to her antics. I hope she's not like this with every student that tries to make a deal with her and that maybe she was just projecting having a bad day or something. But yikes lady wth. 

TL;DR : vendor lady got pissed while making a deal and yanked earring out my hand/removed earrings   from her table and cursed at me"

When I asked her why she was doing all of this when I was still interested in buying the pair of earrings she yanked from my hand, she started cussing at me as if I wasn't there, so I just told her to have a nice day and left.

While I understand that hand-crafted jewelry takes time and effort, I personally think that raising your voice at customers and breaking physical boundaries is not the most effective way to increase sells. It's also kinda sad to have seen her act so nonchalant about her actions because there is other people that could go after her business or react either verbally or physically to her antics. I hope she's not like this with every student that tries to make a deal with her and that maybe she was just projecting having a bad day or something. But yikes lady wth.

TL;DR : vendor lady got pissed while making a deal and yanked earring out my hand/removed earrings   from her table and cursed at me"

The Department of Psychological Science at the University of California, Irvine is currently accepting applications to our post-baccalaureate program in psychological science (the deadline to apply for Fall 2020 is May 22nd). 

**Program** **Overview:**  UCI’s Post-Baccalaureate Program in Psychological Science is a certificate program that combines psychology coursework with research and/or internship experience. It is designed for people who have a bachelor’s degree (in any discipline); who are interested in a psychology-related graduate program, career development, or career change; and who could benefit from additional coursework, research and/or real-life work experience in psychology. Those interested in doctoral-level or master’s degree programs in a range of areas of psychology (including clinical/counseling psychology, social/personality psychology, developmental psychology, health psychology, psychology &amp; the law, and school psychology) or health (e.g., public health, medical school) can strengthen their graduate school applications by completing our program, which offers an individualized course of study based on each person’s qualifications and goals.  Students who have completed our program have been accepted to a wide variety of graduate programs, including Ph.D. programs at UC Berkeley, Cornell University, and UC Irvine; Psy.D. programs at Cal Lutheran, University of Indianapolis, and Yeshiva University, and Master's programs at NYU, Columbia, and UCLA.

**Program** **Description:**  The program consists of eight courses, which may include lower- and upper-division lectures, small seminars (including advanced statistics and research methods), hands-on research lab courses, and/or hands-on internship courses.  The program can be completed at the student’s own pace, in as little as 9 months or in as many as 24 months, depending upon one’s schedule and preferences.  A faculty advisor will work closely with students to help plan courses and provide guidance on obtaining letters of recommendation, choosing graduate programs, writing personal statements, and applying for jobs.  In addition, students will have the opportunity to attend our weekly departmental colloquia and other special events and to interact with our community of faculty, researchers, and graduate students.  For more information, please visit: [https://ps.soceco.uci.edu/post-bacc-page/post-baccalaureate-program-psychological-science](https://ps.soceco.uci.edu/post-bacc-page/post-baccalaureate-program-psychological-science)

**Information** **Session:**  An information session will be held on Friday, February 21st at 11am in Social Ecology I (SE-I) Room 112 on the UC Irvine campus ([http://uci.edu/visit/maps.php](http://uci.edu/visit/maps.php)).  All are welcome!"

Yes,   I understand that kitchen faucet water and restroom faucet water (and   toilet water) likely come from the same source, but how is the general   quality of UCSD tap water overall, for example can we be confident that   there are no metals, chemicals, or bacteria in it that would not be   recommended to drink everyday? Can I safely use this water to cook   grains?

My second and biggest   concern is that the faucet is located in the restroom which is in close   proximity to urine and fecal matter. If I wash to was bowls, dishes,  and  vegetables in there everyday what are the chances that eventually I   will ingest germs,etc. that make me sick?

I'm a second year Electrical Engineering student who throughout his freshman and sophomore year has really enjoyed programming  in my ECE 15 class, IEEE QP projects, as well as Hackathons. This past year, I've been thinking of changing to the Computer Engineering major as I would only have to take one additional course, CSE 11, to apply for a major change.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately as I was making a simple 4 year plan, I realized that if I were to switch to CE, I would be overloaded with CSE lower div courses my junior year. In addition, many of my courses such as ECE 25, ECE 5, and Math 20E would be completely useless. Thankfully ECE 15 can still be used as an elective.

&amp;#x200B;

The course load is looking pretty bad so far. Especially because I was really excited to start upper-div courses next year. But it looks like I'm going to have to take multiple lower div programming courses at once in order to catch up. Also CE doesn't have much ECE courses( I still enjoy the hardware aspect of EE).

&amp;#x200B;

For these reasons, I was wondering, is switching to CE a good idea, especially for someone who still enjoys hardware oriented course. Or should I just take the Machine Learning Depth for EE here at UCSD, and use my technical electives to enroll in CSE courses, or just self-learn on my own. I've heard good things about the EE major and how EEs can easily switch to programming if they want to. Have any of you taken the Machine Learning Depth? And if so, did it provide an adequate amount of software experience? And how is the CE major in general, and how difficult will it be to take the lower div CS courses all at once in one or two quarters? Any help would be appreciated. Thank You!"

I believe the fact that there’s no football team and that students are spread out among the different colleges does NOT give UCSD its reputation of being socially dead. Instead, I blame UCSD’s “social-deadness” on the fact that we are located in La Jolla. La Jolla is for rich people (i.e. not college students), and this prevents La Jolla from feeling like a college town. I think if UCSD were located in a college town it wouldn’t have the reputation of being socially dead, even if nothing changed about the school itself. 

Just my thoughts. Let me know what you think."

1.) If you fail a P/NP class, do you have to retake the same class or can you replace it with a course equivalent? I'm taking cse 30 right now for a prereq to cse 100, but I'm doing it for a cse minor. So could I take cse 5A(An easier prerequisite equivalent) instead? 

2.) I have priority enrollment for the upcoming quarter. If i were to fail this class can I still take CSE 100 next quarter? THEN retake my prerequisite in a later quarter? I'm not a CSE major so my priority enrollment is vital for me to finish my minor.

- We now show [graphs showing how a course has changed over time](https://i.imgur.com/6PldhJr.png) so you can easily tell if a section has been getting better or worse over time.

- By searching for multiple professors' names, you can [quickly compare them against each other](https://i.imgur.com/ALiDucX.png), so you don't have to switch back-and-forth between pages to see which professors to choose over others.

- The raw data for each section is now shown on its section page if you care about seeing the data for every section ever taught for a professor and course.

The Rita will offer apartments units with double and single spaces to hold 2-4 students.  All students living in these communities will not have a required dining plan.  Students will have the option to choose from an available dining plan later in the summer.

Earl Warren College Apartments consist of five or six students in two bedroom apartments. Bates and Brown are now part of the Warren College Community and offer 4 single rooms in each apartment.  All units are furnished and include computer data and cable television connections.

So it sounds like the options will be:

Pepper Canyon, Matthews, The Rita, Bates, or Brown.  Any information on which is a better choice and why?

Thanks!"

Just wanted to send a quick update about yesterday’s COLA activities and the public forum tomorrow at 5pm.

Approximately 150 students came out to the march yesterday! Though we were locked out of the Chancellor’s Office, students read the statement aloud and left a copy at the door. Our local unit of the UAW 2865 sent the UC three demands: 
Housing stipend: The University must provide all student-workers with a housing stipend such that after fees, nobody suffers rent burden. This translates to between $1,400 and $3,100 a month.

Make existing on-campus housing affordable: The University must lower the rent on existing on-campus units such that rents are affordable.

Build affordable on-campus housing for the future: The University must commit to expanding the existing on-campus housing with affordable, high-density units, such that all student-workers have access to an affordable on-campus unit.


Last night, the GSA unanimously passed a resolution in support of the striking student workers at UC Santa Cruz and their support for future actions here at UC San Diego. 

Tomorrow, there will be hosting a public forum open to all students and faculty to update folks on the statewide demonstrations that took place, including a presentation by UC Santa Cruz students. The meeting will be in the Price forum room (4th floor of Price Center) tomorrow, Feb 11th, at 5pm—see flier attached and the Facebook event page below for more details. 

Facebook event page: https://www.facebook.com/events/124987255484885/

Hope you all can make it and share your thoughts on how we can move forward and gain a cost of living adjustment at UCSD!"

As a result, move-in weekend will be pushed back one week to Sept. 26 and Sept. 27, with Fall Quarter 2020 classes beginning on Oct. 1 instead of in September.""

&amp;#x200B;

This UC policy shouldn't even apply because Rosh Hashanah falls on a weekend. Although it's nice that religions are being recognized at UCSD, this is a secular school. If we're going to play the ""Rosh Hashanah"" card, can we also not have school on the week of other new years like Chinese New Years? Rosh Hashanah is on the weekend, we can start school on Monday or even Tuesday. Do they Realize Yom Kippur is STILL on the Monday of Move-in? Also, do they realize that Hanukkah falls on fall finals week in that case? Can we have the month of April-May off for Ramadan? 

&amp;#x200B;

Why is UCSD observing this policy when other UC's aren't? UC Berkeley starts academics August 26th. UC Merced's begins August 26th. UCSD doesn't have to start later, it can start earlier and accommodate to everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

UCSD students are already super stressed, and our summer is already too long. All of my friends go to back to university before me and get out earlier. If they had moved that week to spring break, it would have been more understandable, however removing a week will do nothing but make the break less enjoyable. Personally, I need all three weeks to recoup from fall quarter, so burnout among students is inevitable. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thus, my conclusion is that this sucks, the UC policy is whack, and this is merely a conspiracy to make more time to build the new 6th college because they're behind schedule and promised incoming freshmen housing that they do not have. I feel that the student body would have no problem starting earlier and having longer breaks than the other way around.

I was planning my classes on Webreg for next quarter, but then realized it eats too much of my time. Thus, I thought about how amazing would be if I had a simple Chrome Extension that did, at the very least, compare all the time slots for the classes I want with my personal time preference.

Example:

Class: Math 20A 

Desired Time(s): 11am-3pm &amp; 5pm-7pm 

Return: *Classes in between those times*

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, I also want to also compare the evaluations for each professor as well.

I began to try and develop the Chrome Extension yesterday, but I have run into a major snag--Webreg keeps hidden many of the various components necessary to automate the task(I probably should be asking the people at Webreg). Nevertheless, I believe this is a worthy project. So, I am asking for help from anyone who knows JavaScript or has different methods(using Python, Java, etc.) in which this task is able to be accomplished. If many respond to this post then I'll start a GitHub for it when the overall details are finalized(so we know where the project is going)."

I recently learned about ux/ui and fell completely in love with it. I had no idea that there were majors related to this field and gained interest in UCSD’s cognitive science major. 

But, I’m currently a freshman doing business (chose it as a “safety” and because I didn’t really know what I wanted to do) at a 4 year university and I was wondering if it was feasible to transfer into UCSD. 

Sadly, my university offers nothing remotely related to cognitive science. It’s not a stem/tech/research heavy university, which makes it quite lacking in technology and computer science courses. :(

Would it even be possible transferring in if I took summer classes and tailored my sophomore year classes so that it could be transferred as credit to UCSD?

Also, is there anyone who transferred from a 4 year college, not from a UC or CC? If so, was it difficult?"

Whethere or not you agree with the thread is not premise of this post. I want to focus on the numerous comments that were removed and how the thread was ultimately locked. This is a poor decision on behalf of this sub's mod team. Reddit is a platform for community discussion and removing posts at will jeopardizes the fundamental characteristics that promote the exchange of ideas. The mods claimed there was name calling and harassment. However, most of those comments were down voted and ultimately hidden forcing a user to manually view them. These were community actions self-moderating the forum. If the individual has the confidence to stand by their remarks let it remain in their post history. 

The mod team should not have the ability to remove comments. It's clear the community will eventually swing the conversation and those utilizing offensive language will not be rewarded with attention. This also removes the possibility for an over-zealous moderator that has strong feelings that censoring a potentially useful conversation. Users have the ability to block accounts that they do not wish to interact with, thus the mod team does not have a need to perform this unrequested task. Removing the comment does not remove the motivation for creating it.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Could you help us understand how emotions buffer people against stress experienced by immigrants?  


To participate in this study, you need to be 

1.       International students or second-generation immigrant and

2.       In college or graduate school

You will only take some short online surveys (25 minutes long). We don't collect any information on immigration status or physical address. 1 in 5 participants will win a $25 Amazon gift card. We also got IRB approval. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**This research can help identify more protective factors for immigrants with fewer resources.**  **Further , this study hopes to contribute to reducing health disparities in immigrant families.**  If you are willing to help, please reach me by direct message.

Thank you!"

He is being transferred to study Wuhan pneumonia virus.  He just called me and told me to tell my friends: If you have a runny nose and sputum when you have a cold, you cannot be a new type of coronavirus pneumonia, because coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough without runny nose. This is the simplest way to identify.  Please tell your friends that if you know more about medical knowledge, you will have more awareness of identification and prevention.  Dean Reference
 Repost
 This time, the Wuhan virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed at a temperature of 26-27 degrees. Therefore, drink more hot water. You can tell your friends and relatives to drink more hot water to prevent it. Go under the  Sun. It has been cold recently, and drinking hot water is also very comfortable. It is not a cure and is good for the body. Drinking warm water is effective for all viruses. Try not to drink ice, remember!

Doctor's advice about coronavirus:

1. It is pretty large in size (cell is about 400-500nm diameter), so any normal mask (not just the  N95 feature) should be able to filter it out. However, when someone who's infected sneezes in front of you, it will take a great 3 meters (about 10 feet) before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne. 

2. When the virus drops on metal surface, it will live for at least 12 hours. So remember if you come in contact with any metal surface, wash your hands with soap thoroughly. 

3. The virus can remain active on fabric for 6-12 hours. Normal laundry detergent should kill the virus. For winter clothing that does not require daily washing, you can put it out under the sun to kill the virus. 

About the symptoms of the pneumonia caused by Coronavirus:

1. It will first infect the throat, so the throat will have the dry sore throat feeling which will last for 3 to 4 days

2. Then the virus will blend into the nasal fluid and drips into the trachea and enter the lungs, causing pneumonia. This process will take 5 to 6 days.    

3. With pneumonia, comes high fever and difficulty in breathing. The nasal congestion is not like the normal kind. You will feel like you are drowning in water. It's important to go seek immediate medical attention if you feel like this. 

About prevention:

1. The most common way of getting infected is by touching things in public, so you must wash your hands frequently. The virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 mins, but a lot can happen in those 5-10 mins (you can rub your eyes or pick your nose unwittingly).

2. Aside from washing your hands frequently, you can gargle with Betadine Sore Throat Gargle to eliminate or minimize the germs while they are still in your throat (before dripping down to your lungs). 

Folks, take extra care and drink plenty of water.

(우리 반 친구 삼촌과 조카, 석사학위를 받고 졸업했고 선전병원에서 일한다.  그는 우한 폐렴 바이러스를 연구하기 위해 전근되고 있다.  그는 방금 나에게 전화해서 친구들에게 이렇게 말하라고 했다. 감기에 걸렸을 때 콧물과 가래가 나온다면, 코로나바이러스 폐렴은 콧물 없이 마른 기침이기 때문에 새로운 형태의 코로나바이러스 폐렴이 될 수 없다. 이것이 식별하는 가장 간단한 방법이다.  만약 여러분이 의학 지식에 대해 더 많이 안다면, 여러분은 식별과 예방에 대한 더 많은 인식을 갖게 될 것이라고 친구들에게 말하라.  딘 레퍼런스
 리포스트
 이번에 우한 바이러스는 내열성이 없어 26~27도의 온도에서 살처분된다. 그러므로 뜨거운 물을 더 마셔라. 당신은 그것을 막기 위해 당신의 친구들과 친척들에게 뜨거운 물을 더 마시라고 말할 수 있다. 태양 아래로 가라. 최근에 날씨가 추웠고, 더운 물을 마시는 것도 매우 편안하다. 그것은 치료법이 아니고 몸에 좋다. 따뜻한 물을 마시는 것은 모든 바이러스에 효과적이다. 얼음을 마시지 않도록 해, 기억해!

코로나바이러스에 대한 의사의 조언:

1. 크기가 꽤 크므로(셀은 직경 약 400500nm) 일반 마스크(N95 기능만이 아니라)라면 얼마든지 걸러낼 수 있어야 한다. 하지만 감염된 사람이 앞에서 재채기를 하면 3m(약 10피트)가 크게 걸려 땅에 떨어져 더 이상 공중에 떠있지 않게 된다. 

2. 바이러스가 금속 표면에 떨어지면 최소 12시간 이상 살 수 있다. 그러므로 만약 여러분이 금속 표면에 접촉한다면, 비누로 손을 깨끗이 씻어야 한다는 것을 기억하라. 

3. 이 바이러스는 섬유에서 6-12시간 동안 활동을 계속할 수 있다. 일반 세탁 세제는 바이러스를 죽여야 한다. 매일 세탁이 필요 없는 겨울옷의 경우 햇빛 아래 내놓아 바이러스를 없앨 수 있다. 

코로나바이러스에 의한 폐렴의 증상에 대해서는 다음과 같이 말하고 있다.

1. 먼저 목구멍에 감염되기 때문에 목구멍이 건조하고 아픈 느낌이 3~4일 지속된다.

2. 그러면 그 바이러스는 코액에 섞여 기관지로 흘러 들어가 폐렴을 일으킬 것이다. 이 과정은 5~6일이 걸릴 것이다.    

3. 폐렴과 함께 고열과 호흡곤란이 온다. 코막힘은 보통과 같지 않다. 물에 빠진 기분일 것이다. 만약 당신이 이렇게 느낀다면 즉시 의사의 진찰을 받는 것이 중요하다. 

차단 정보:

1. 감염되는 가장 흔한 방법은 공공장소에서 물건을 만지는 것이므로 손을 자주 씻어야 한다. 이 바이러스는 5-10분 동안만 당신 손으로 살 수 있지만, 그 5-10분 동안 많은 일들이 일어날 수 있다(눈 비비거나 자신도 모르게 코를 후비거나 할 수 있다).

2. 손을 자주 씻는 것 말고도 베타딘 소르 throat Gargle과 함께 양치질하여 아직 목구멍에 있는 세균을 제거하거나 최소화할 수 있다(폐까지 흘러내리기 전). 

여러분, 각별히 조심하시고 물을 많이 드십시오.

I need you help in building our subreddit wiki. As you all know, a wiki is an online encyclopedia. Although Wikipedia already has an article about UCSD, our wiki should have more information that is relevant to our community and any future Tritons. 

So, what do you think should belong to our wiki? It could be anything from FAQ, helpful sites, or even relevant UCSD memes. Any ideas is useful.

Thanks!

Today in class, my TA poked fun at Chinese students saying our fancy clothing and cars are no match for the virus. Yesterday, when I told my friend group about my sister, they sent coronavirus memes to our group chat. Regarding my TA, her poking fun at us is one thing but what really got to me was the idea of international students being filthy rich. It made my stomach drop as I recall my family selling plenty of their assets and borrowing money from people to send me to the US for a brighter future. I want to be able to return the favor one day as I am forever grateful for such support. Unfortunately, I’m at my breaking point right now and I don’t even think I can get it through the quarter.

Not fragmented into 2 or even 3 parts or places!

Not sure if this is the right place to ask for advice regarding applications and admissions, but I thought it'd be a bit better than r/gradadmissions and hopefully someone here can give me some tips or advice more focused on UCSD, as I know admissions is extremely competitive.

I just finished my first semester for my master's and am looking to apply this fall/winter for the fall 2021 semester's CS PhD program. My interests are largely ML and deep learning, and more specifically are geometric deep learning, imbalanced dataset ML, and financial ML.

I've been looking at the faculty and research labs at UCLA, and it actually doesn't seem like there are a lot of labs focused on ML (at least less than I thought).

Just an FYI, here are my stats:

GPA: 3.84/4.0 (1st semester of MS), 3.2ish/4.0 (undergrad) - Just an FYI, my home institution uses a 4.5 scale and these are roughly rescaled.

GRE: 163V/169Q/5.5AW

Research: one publication in a domestic journal (Korea), one paper submitted to an int'l conference, involved in three other research projects as of now (not sure if these will actually lead to any ""real"" results, but hopefully they do).

What would be some tips or advice for me to raise my chances of admission? My biggest weak points right now are my undergrad GPA and lack of research publications. Does anyone here know any particular professors I should reach out to?

Any tips or advice are appreciated. Thanks!"

I would imagine that some/most international students would go home, and since a large portion of them live in China, they have an extremely high chance of getting the coronavirus. Moreover, since it can take at least 14 days for symptoms to appear, and spring break is only 7-13 days (depending on when winter finals end and when they go home), they can unknowingly infect others in the crowded lecture halls and overpopulated campus.

Also, I would imagine that some don't want to admit they have the coronavirus, since it would require a mandatory quaratine, and they don't wanna miss things like mandatory lectures, quizzes, and midterms. I think should this happen, professors should put students health as the 1st priority and allow take-home midterms/quizzes for students with coronavirus.

Idk if i'm overthinking and being paranoid, is it just me or is anyone else concerned about the coronavirus after spring break? Luckily, we didn't have to worry about this over winter break as the coronavirus hadn't spread as much, but now that the coronavirus has spread to nearly all parts of China, it is a concern going forward, and it only takes 1 coronavirus victim to infect 5 others, which will then multiply rapidly.

Dear Colleagues:

Given the rapid spread of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), UC San
Diego needs to be prepared should some students, staff, and faculty on
our campus be ill or under quarantine in the coming weeks and months.
Our UC San Diego community must collectively ensure that we can still
provide our students the outstanding education they deserve.

We are writing to let you know that we expect all faculty and academic
administrators to take the actions outlined below, for the educational
benefit of our UC San Diego students. 

Faculty are expected to take the following steps.  If you encounter
challenges, please alert your department chair or other unit leader. 

EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, the instructor of record for each course taught
at UC San Diego MUST

1.    Establish a complete and regularly updated gradebook in the Canvas
learning management system [https://canvas.ucsd.edu]; if your course is
already in Triton Ed, you may use that platform instead. This will
ensure that if the instructor or other course staff become ill or are
under quarantine, an accurate record of all assignment scores will be
accessible, so that students can receive their course grades in a timely
manner.
2.    Ensure that final exam papers can be reliably collected and graded,
and the course grades computed and submitted, even if the instructor or
other course staff become ill or are quarantined.
3.    Plan how to adjust course policies related to class attendance so as
not to penalize students who become ill or are placed under quarantine. 

STARTING IN SPRING QUARTER 2020, the instructor of record for each
course taught at UC San Diego MUST take the three steps listed above,
and also:

4.    Place all key course documents (e.g., syllabi, assignments, reading
lists) on Canvas, so that students can access them remotely even if
unable to come to campus due to illness or quarantine.  If the course
has a separate website, provide a link to it from Canvas.  You are
highly encouraged to take this step for your Winter 2020 courses.

STARTING IN SPRING QUARTER 2020, all faculty are ENCOURAGED to do the
following to make it feasible for students to keep up with a course even
if illness, quarantine, or travel restrictions prevent them from coming
to campus:

5.    If feasible, arrange for lecture capture/podcasting of your course.
Use the Kaltura tool to create/distribute the videos/podcasts via
Canvas.  This ensures that the material is stored safely and is
available with sufficient internet bandwidth.
6.    Make those videos or podcasts available to your department, as part
of an inventory other instructors can draw upon if necessary.
7.    Ask your department whether previous instructors have captured
lectures for your course, so you can draw upon those as necessary and
appropriate.

EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, academic administrators (deans, chairs,
directors, and provosts) are REQUIRED to take the following steps.

*    Work with all faculty in your unit to ensure they take the steps
outlined above.
*    Make contingency plans for how your unit will keep courses running if
instructors or course staff become ill or are quarantined.
*    Plan ahead to meet the ADA needs of quarantined instructors or
students who had arranged accommodation with respect to in-person.
*    Plan to increase summer course offerings for summer 2020 to support
the academic advancement of students from abroad who cannot go home
during summer 2020.  This should include current students and inbound
transfers from CA community colleges.
*    Inventory courses for which lecture capture exists already.  Make
faculty aware of the inventory and make the material available as needed
to support current courses.
*    Arrange for key courses to undergo lecture capture in Spring 2020,
Summer 2020, and beyond, so as to provide the greatest coverage in
future times of need.

For assistance with the items involving educational technology, please

Thank you for taking these steps to ensure the educational resilience of
our campus and to support our students’ academic success, in the face of the challenges posed by COVID-19."

You have a bunch of grad students who are trying to get a Master's degree or higher, but are being paid minimum wage, and probably live on campus.  I'm willing to assume that these people aren't paid full time because they're probably multitasking other classes that's not for TA/IA.  So they probably have terrible paychecks to meet the cost of living.

The way I see it is you have a bunch of employees who work for a company that also makes said employees pay rent to the company.  And to make matters worse the rent prices are probably increasing or the overall cost of living is increasing and these employees are not getting any pay raise to make ends meet.

In words of Morty from Rick and Morty, 
""That sounds like slavery but with extra steps.""

Idk feel free to correct me on what I know but I know for a fact that these people who have degrees should not be paid minimum wage, especially when they are pursuing a Masters degree."
