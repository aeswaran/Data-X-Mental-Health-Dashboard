I really like math courses that are rigorous and proof-oriented.

Please be patient and open-minded as I spill the details of this story. I am extremely grateful that I’m an incoming fresh at Stanford. It was just the perfect fit for me. The resources seem boundless. I’m from an upper-middle class single home. My mother came from a low-income family(she’s first gen—first to go to college), immigrated to the U.S, worked her butt off to become the physician she is today. We essentially started off as working-middle class(when my twin and I were born), by 10 years of age we were middle class, and by 15 years of age we were upper-middle class—she essentially broke the cycle for the family. I have a twin(going to a top school on the east cost—same name brand) also, so that’s two people going to college at the same time. She’s a single parent, so she’s the only person paying for both our fees. She’s extremely proud about us the colleges that we’re attending. The caveat is that she’s paying almost full cost for each person. I feel guilty sometimes because a good chunk of her salary is going into paying for 2 people at the same time while taking care(financially) of family members back in her home country. Sometimes we hear the complaint about fees—jokingly and un jokingly, which is perfectly understandable. 

Both my sibling and I want to go into medicine as well. I understand that there are quicker and more lucrative option to wealth than going into medicine. At an event today, my mom’s colleagues essentially hinted at me not to go into medicine when I’m paying such high cost to go to Stanford. They were suggesting I explore other routes out there that will make me a higher income in a shorter amount of time. They basically said keep an open-mind—you’re around Silicon Valley make all that fees worth it. They suggested that one going into medicine didn’t need such an expensive school, so if I’m going there I might as well take advantage of all the other non-med related resources.

Now, my mom has been supportive of whatever decision I make. She essentially told me to do whatever makes me happy.

So, I ask this question (please consider the circumstances) to those who are upper classmen and alum—has the Stanford name tag been worth it to you?"

Specifically I'm looking for data science/analytics positions, and all but one of my previous internships have been via connections. My background is: random quantitative undergrad + CS coterm and previous intern experience is:

* freshman summer: big tech company/software engineer (via Handshake);
* sophomore year: financial services firm/data scientist (Stanford-funded program)
* sophomore summer: research institute/quantitative analyst (via connections);
* junior year: large retail company/data scientist (via connections);
* junior summer: random startup/data scientist (via connections);
* senior year (I have not yet decided if I will accept the offer): large media corporation/data scientist (via connections), but they have no plans to hire another data scientist full-time;

I also don't really want to return to any of the companies I previously worked at, so that is an issue. I guess I can think of a few possible ways to get jobs, but I am not sure if any of them are effective.

Career fairs: I went to all the career fairs (fall general fair, engineering fair, spring fair, random BEAM center fairs, social impact fair, etc) every year and gave out my resumes, but I didn't really get anywhere, so I'm not sure if I was doing the process wrong, or if now that I'm a senior, companies will take me seriously. Do people actually get anything from these routes? Also, a lot of companies just say to apply online.

Handshake: I did get a small handful of interviews and 2 software engineering internship offers freshman year after applying for 300+ software positions on Handshake (it was awful). But I tried to apply for positions during sophomore year and junior year (although they were more stats/data science focused) and never got invited to interview anywhere. Also, a lot of companies just redirect you to apply on their official website, which never leads anywhere.

Company talks: tech companies come give a presentation on campus and hundreds of people pack the room and drop their resumes. The recruiters/company engineers just get swarmed with a bunch of people. Are these ever effective?

Referrals/connections: Most of my friends are not working in tech (yes, surprising), or I have already gotten referred by them. I am only close with a few professors, so that is another option.

What is the normal timeline for recruiting? I understand that internship recruiting is usually fall/early winter, but is full-time recruiting year-round?"

My name is Ryan.

I'm pretty involved in CS at Stanford, and I wanted to see if I could help answer people's questions. Some things I can speak to:

* Course selection: I'm familiar with most common CS classes here and am happy to give advice on classes to take. I am head TA for a new intro CS class this quarter (CS 106AX), so I'm especially interested in helping people new to CS start off in the best class for their background.
* Teaching: I have TA'ed several different classes, both as an undergrad and a grad student. I also lectured (as the primary instructor) for CS 110 (our Unix systems class) last summer.
* Internships and software engineering: I've worked in a national lab (Sandia), at a startup (Expanse), at a big company (Facebook), at a nonprofit (Khan Academy), and started my own startup in a past life.

I'm also happy to answer other questions about my Stanford experience. Some topics off the top of my head:

* Transferring and adjusting to Stanford
* Staffing in an undergraduate dorm
* Playing/recording music on campus
* Anything on my website (reberhardt.com)
* Other random life things? AMA!

This week is pretty busy, so I may not respond right away, but I'll keep answering for as long as people are asking questions. Hope this is helpful!"

I made an app called Bubble (website is BubbleApp.io) which allows the user to create a chatroom confined to a circle on a map. For example, you could be at the dining hall and make a ""Bubble"" over the dining hall and you'll receive all messages sent to that place and can chat with anyone else at the dining hall. I want to launch it at a high school, where I believe their lack of any social platform (kids don't use fb anymore) and localized environment would be ideal for Bubble and I believe it will acquire great traction which I will then seek funding from an investor I know who's interested in the potential of this project (unlikely, but that's my current plan).

I made the Android client, but now I'm looking for someone who knows iOS for the iOS client and to just be a general technical partner. If you or anyone you know might be interested in some work (should be pretty light), feel free to email me at shahjmirza@gmail.com! Thanks!"

3) biologists dont know what a species is-thus theory of evolution is nonsense

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/BIOLOGISTS-DON.pdf

all very simple and clear

the facts are

1) 1 is a finite number it stops

A finite decimal is one that stops, like 0.157

A non-finite decimal like 0.999... does not stop

when a finite number 1 = a non-finite number 0.999.. then maths ends in contradiction

another way

1 is an integer a whole number

0.888... is a non-integer it is not a whole number

0.999... is a non-integer not a whole number

when a integer 1 =a non-integer 0.999... maths ends in contradiction

2)1)Darwins book is called On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection ....

but

this paper shows natural selection is not the origin of new species Natural selection is not the origin of new species

Natural selection does not generate new genes/species Natural selection adds no new genetic information as it only deals with the passing on of genes/traits already present and it will be pointed out genetics cannot account for

the generation of new species/genes as it is claimed the generation of new genes [via mutation] is a random process due to radiation, viruses, chemicals etc and genetic cannot account for these process happening as they are out side the scope of genetics physics, chaos theory etc may give some explanation but genetics cant

2) Biologist cant tell us what a species is -without contradiction thus evolution theory ie evolving species is nonsense

Biologists agree there is species hybridization

but that contradicts what a species is

3) biologist tell us they investigate life

but

they cant tell us what life is-they can tell us what life does but cant tell us what life is they cant even give a definition of life that is not nonsense"

If they wanted to go, would they need to be careful about buying seats that are next to each other? I understand that most college football stadiums don't really enforce seating that much and as long as you can gain admission, you can sit anywhere. For Stanford's stadium, as long as we find a place to sit, could we sit anywhere in the general section? Or are seats generally assigned and strictly enforced by administrators? Also, I'd imagine that the Big Game will gain way more attendance than typical games."

I'd love to hear any feedback from your experiences with any HCP Masters program Stanford offers, particularly about:

- general thoughts and feelings about the nature of the program;
- experiences with professor / student interactions from afar;
- general caliber of the material;
- unanticipated costs, outside of tuition;
- experiences any remote-HCP folks had with exam monitors;
- anything you wish you'd known before you got started.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Arrillaga**: the food here is sooo good! The chicken is nice and juicy, the building is so large, and the staff are so friendly. The attribute that puts Arrillaga over the top is their garden, which grows all the food served in the dining hall. It is huge and you won't have any trouble finding a seat. 10/10
2. **FloMo**: I love the view in this dining hall and the fact that the name is an abbreviation is so cool! I haven't tried the food yet, but the ice cream is really good (doesn't compare to Arrillaga though). Also, say hi to John on the cooking staff while you're there. 10/10
3. **Lakeside**: I have some friends in Roble (best dorm!) and stopped by to check out the dining hall nearby. The dining room feels like a conference hall, the tables are pentagons and the chairs are nice and sturdy. I will say that the drink serving section allows people to walk up and steal, which is a terrible design choice. Still check it out! 9/10
4. **Ricker**: The food was stupendous but it's lower on this list because it's kind of far away from all my classes and it's inconvenient for my schedule. 6/10
5. **Wilbur:** It's literally a 2 minute walk from my dorm, the food is pretty great, and the staff is pretty friendly. However, the smoothies are not a regular occurrence and the soft-serve machine seems to be broken all the time. 5/10
6. **Casper**: Very close to Wilbur, and the quad is pretty nice. I will say one thing though, it's full of athletes, and as a 5'3 115 pound man, they make me feel inferior. Stay far away from this dining hall if you're an average sized human and want to feel that way at Stanford. 4/10
7. **Stern**: This dining hall deserves a special place in hell. Coming from a place with very authentic Mexican food and a large Mexican-American population (New Hampshire), the burrito bowl experience was terrible. They didn't speak to me in Spanish and it doesn't taste as good as the family-owned Taco Bell in my hometown. Eat here at your own risk. 2/10"

My name is Marc, and I'm here representing the **Stanford Poop Initiative**! We are a club operating out of FloMo aimed at encouraging a healthy and enriching pooping culture here on campus while spreading sustainable and equitable pooping practices globally. After the overwhelming support and turnout at last night's meeting, the SPI board has decided to open applications to the SPI 2019-20 Competitive League--how does it work? 

  
\- We use an app developed right here on campus called ""Poop Map."" It is available for free on both Apple and Android, and it essentially allows users to review the bathrooms they used and the poops themselves.

\- **Participants will join the ""SPI 19-20"" Competitive league by downloading the app, Poop Map, creating a profile, clicking ""Leagues"" at the bottom right, pressing ""Join"" and then typing ""SPI 19-20"". Enrollment is open!**

\- Last year, we had a league of over 200 strong, and a map quite literally covered in pins. Our goal this year is to outpoop our previous efforts; moreover, we have recently gotten wind of the fact that a certain UC Berkeley has also created a poop league, so we will focus efforts this year on reconnaissance and sabotage. In fact, I will delete this post shortly so as they do not see it. 

\- The requirements for membership are quite strict; we expect at least seven weekly logs, however, joining the league is not binding. Casual poopers are welcome too, they just won't get any t-shirts or get to go on the retreat. Special prizes will be given throughout the year to whoever poops the most and in the most varied locations.

If you have any questions or reservations, please feel free to pm me or shoot an email to [stdpoop@stanford.edu](mailto:stdpoop@stanford.edu)! We would love to see you at any of our biweekly meetings :)"

I'm currently applying to Stanford's Masters in CS program. On the official Stanford webpage, they state: ""The Computer Science Department does not offer financial support for MS students"". However, on the same webpage, they also state that limited CA/RA resources (tuition + stipend funding) are sometimes available to Master's students once matriculated.

On the application website, it asks the following required question:

""Are you applying for financial aid such as fellowships or assistantships from Stanford University (e.g., Departmental funding)? - Yes/No""

I'm not sure which one to pick right now. The reason being that I think picking ""Yes"" will significantly hurt my chances in admissions, since Stanford clearly states not to expect funding for MS students. However, I'm planning on working hard if I get in and secure CA/RA funding. If I check ""No"" on the app, I'm worried that I will be barred from ever applying for CA/RA funding, since the department can point to my application and say ""look here, you clearly said you're not applying for financial aid"".

What do you think? Am I overthinking this? Will checking Yes have a detrimental impact on my application? Thanks in advance!

We had a major family accident and I’ve been in the ER since Tuesday afternoon. Things are not well atm. 


 Yesterday night I realized that Slideroom gave me a 24 hour grace period——so I proceeded to submit my entire application LATE (around 9pm yesterday night.)


Now I don’t know what to do.

Is Stanford going to read my application? Or throw me in the pool with RD applicants? I’m not sure if anyone knows:(

REA means a lot to me because I’d like to know if I was denied/accepted early. this is really upsetting to me and i take full responsibility for the late application. stanford is my dream school and i believe I ruined all of my chances for admission.  I feel so incredibly stupid. I worked so hard on this. 

I know this isn’t admissions or anything but does anyone know who I should call?

I am a prospective senior applicant for Stanford undergrad 2024(my dream school). I was wondering if Stanford full price is worth it as my parents did not qualify for much financial aid(income \~ 240k) through FAFSA and they have just bought a new house, which meant taking a pretty hefty loan while paying for our last home(trying to sell). If I attend Stanford, I hope to chase and squeeze every opportunity, internship, connections to VCs in Bay Area/amazing funding opportunities/networking connections, and immerse myself within the start-up culture and create 2-3 companies(have ideas already in mind), which is why it is my dream school.  My plan is to double major in bioengineering and MSE and I believe I have the caliber to achieve these things based on my unique track record in high school and work ethic(all by myself and through persistence: started profitable company in high school, won international competitions, was top 2% in competitive high school in Texas, did 5 internships etc.). My question is: Stanford is going to be around 250k-300k in loans which I believe I will have to mostly pay(along with some parent contribution) but based on my description, goals, and ambitious nature can it be a good idea to go if I get in. While there are other options/schools out there without the need for such a big loan,  I know that by going to Stanford I will be able to fast-track the ability to achieve my dreams and have the connections to the bay area/funding/ and world-class professors in front of me. Has anyone else been through the same situation(taking large loans) and attended Stanford?

3) biologists dont know what a species is-thus theory of evolution is nonsense

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/BIOLOGISTS-DON.pdf

all very simple and clear

the facts are

1) 1 is a finite number it stops

A finite decimal is one that stops, like 0.157

A non-finite decimal like 0.999... does not stop

when a finite number 1 = a non-finite number 0.999.. then maths ends in contradiction

another way

1 is an integer a whole number

0.888... is a non-integer it is not a whole number

0.999... is a non-integer not a whole number

when a integer 1 =a non-integer 0.999... maths ends in contradiction

2)1)Darwins book is called On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection ....

but

this paper shows natural selection is not the origin of new species Natural selection is not the origin of new species

Natural selection does not generate new genes/species Natural selection adds no new genetic information as it only deals with the passing on of genes/traits already present and it will be pointed out genetics cannot account for

the generation of new species/genes as it is claimed the generation of new genes [via mutation] is a random process due to radiation, viruses, chemicals etc and genetic cannot account for these process happening as they are out side the scope of genetics physics, chaos theory etc may give some explanation but genetics cant

2) Biologist cant tell us what a species is -without contradiction thus evolution theory ie evolving species is nonsense

Biologists agree there is species hybridization

but that contradicts what a species is

3) biologist tell us they investigate life

but

they cant tell us what life is-they can tell us what life does but cant tell us what life is they cant even give a definition of life that is not nonsense"

I know in one certain very famous AI lab, it is rather competitive to get an RAship, and I think I'd want to work in a less trendy research group anyways. The problem is that professors don't really advertise their policies for giving RAships online, so would it be appropriate to mention it in the first email? I want to do research in my area of interest (NLP, information systems, sustainability, data science), but the reality is that I need financial support as well, so I don't want to waste my time working somewhere that has no possibility of funding me in the future. If anyone can shed some light on professors' general policies around giving RAships, and also if anyone can give some lab recommendations, I would also appreciate that. Also, I'm a CS coterm but working in a different department is also fine, as long as 50/25% RAships are available (for instance, my undergrad department pays non-PhD grad students an hourly rate for RAships).

One, for the arts portfolio: I plan on submitting some music pieces. Do they have to be original or can they be renderings? Also, am I allowed to have accompaniment but the video will still be centered on me?

Also, I'm applying Regular Decision as an International Student. Wanted to know if the request for financial aid will rebound in my face. Any international students here who got in with financial aid? Approximately how much aid did you get?

Also, I've heard many people say that since the admissions at Stanford is holistic, kids with perfect SAT and ACT scores have been rejected. I have a 1580, does this mean it REDUCES my chances as such or is it just that if my application isn't well rounded I'll be given the boot?

While I know there are countless other resources on the internet that offer advice on getting into Stanford or other big name schools, I thought maybe I should ask some current/former students here on r/stanford.    


I should start with some background: I am a (soon to be) GED holder. Unfortunately my parents would let me go to high school, so I’ll be earning my equivalency credential instead. I’ll also be taking the ACT in December, and I’ve gotten a 33-34 or so on all of the full-length past year tests I’ve taken and self scored. That’s without practice, and I’m going to set aside 3 hours on weekdays and 5 on the weekends until the test to study, so I hope to bring my score up by 1 or 2 points. I know, however, that universities look at more than just your test scores, and often consider extracurricular activities. Unfortunately I missed out on many of these opportunities as a result of dropping out, and my parents never would allow me to join a club/volunteer/etc. I’ve been taking undergraduate-level for-credit courses backed by ASU on edX over the last month or so to give me more to put on my application. I also hope to take the SAT and 3 SAT Subject tests if I am able to get a hold of a fee waiver (I have been working with a local high school counselor, however she isn’t sure if she’ll be able to pull through and the registration deadline is Friday).

&amp;#x200B;

I’m looking for advice on what else I can do to improve my application. And how does my background compare to yours as someone who was accepted? Some people have suggested I explain my situation however I don’t think Stanford wants my sob story and I don’t expect them to accept it. I know that many highly qualified people don’t make it into Stanford and no matter what my situation may be my chances of being accepted are tiny, but if I don’t try I’ll forever wonder what may have happened had I put in the effort.

I think I may have fell into a creative arrogant trap. I’m currently in Canada at a University that seemed to have been a good option for someone who is creative and intellectual. For anyone who knows Elon Musk and his story, I quite literally thought I was clever enough to go to a harder school than Musk did in Canada but still try to transfer to a school in the US. That was a bad plan. It was appealing, who wouldn’t want to transfer from one impossible school to another and have that as their history? I then realized that this University is trying so hard to have a good reputation that it cares less about what the students actually learn than having the hardest courses. Turns out, everyone is failing their courses and everything is curved all the time. Thus, it is quite impossible to transfer as it seems that averages are nearing 60 at this school. Overall, it is a massive trap and a hellhole for someone who is creative and wants to build things. I have no time to do anything because of the massive course load and being in one of the hardest programs. Not only that but the professors at the school can barely speak English. I’m not sure what to do being someone who was chasing the reputation of the school and hoping it would be easy to transfer to a US school so I could actually enjoy world renowned professors, creative students, and time to learn. The US is rather more creative than Canada and I think I have made a bad decision. As before, I could see the path to success, now all I see is me finishing this degree then being trapped in Canada and never starting a business in the US. I’m not sure what to do, my dreams are too big that I will never give up but I don’t want to waste my life here."

I know some MA/MS programs are free to enter for anyone who can get the grades (like Econ's MA) but I know the application process is a lot more involved for statistics. I've seen someone say the coterm isn't too hard to get into assuming the above stuff is adequate, so I have a hunch that they'd act similarly for PhD students, but I'd love to know if anyone has some additional insight beyond my own guesswork.

I was wondering whether anyone here has been successful in using SCPD courses (taken online) to meet the CS prerequisite that most MSCS programs have?

My own situation is that I live in the UK and have a BS and MS in Economics (from top universities here with 3.7-4.0 GPA equivalents I think). I want to apply to the US for MSCS programs next year (for Fall 2021 entry) and as most of them require some CS background I'm looking around for ways I can acquire the credits in the next 1-2 years. SCPD's certificate looks like one solid option. Another is Oregon State University's online post-bacc in CS, which confers a complete BS and is cheaper per credit hour but I'm thinking that the brand name recognition of Stanford might help - maybe the courses will be perceived as more rigorous.

Another thing I'd be after is getting letters of recommendation from professors - anyone know if this is possible if you take an active student role in a SCPD course?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated - thanks! :)"

I know that admission to Stanford does not get you accepted into a major, just the university itself, but is that the same for music? Because it usually isn't like that for many other universities. I do not intend to apply for music and then completely ditch it, I am definitely going to major (or at least minor) in music and take up another major in something else. The thing is my music side of things is really strong, in terms of both academics and extracurriculars, so I'm sure applying for that would benefit me.

My question is how easy is it to branch out into another major offered? Economics or engineering for example? I presume it's not difficult at all but I just want to be sure.

question - is it necessary for me to get accepted somewhere else with a better financial aid package to meaningfully negotiate for better aid? how effective is that given stanford knows they're the best (???how did i get in lol???) and pretty hard to turn down? i obviously don't want to contrive any family crises to request more aid, but would really really appreciate if they met the requirements we expressed in css. what are my options here? is sending a simple appeal letter reminding them of things like my grandparents' medical expenses sufficient, or do i absolutely have to get in somewhere with better aid to send in the letter? because i really really dont wanna apply anywhere else lol.

I am planning on applying to Stanford, UPenn, and UChicago next year and doing econ and stats as a double major, but I had a few questions. 

1) Is econ and stats in Liberal Arts and Sciences or is it in the business school? Are there even specific business undergrad majors? If there are, is taking a specific business major like finance or marketing just as good as econ and stats if I want to get an MBA and eventually a management role, or is it too limiting?

2) How hard is an econ and stats double major? I know that prestigious schools are really hard, and I wanted to know if stanford is the same or if it is relatively easy to the other prestigious schools.

3) Is econ and stats going to help me find a consulting internship out of college and eventually help me get an MBA?

4) How much calculus would be needed for this double degree? I stopped after Calc BC and I am only taking Comp Sci as my math in senior year because I don't want to do Calc 3.

5) Is grade deflation a thing and will it hurt me?

I know I would have to pay for it myself, which is part of the reason why I haven't really been interested in doing it, the other reason is because I like having a life outside of work.

If I did want to take a course though, is it still possible to sign up for one for next quarter? Anyone know I how I do it as a non-degree student? From what I could tell only online HCP courses are open to non-degree students. 

I know the prof whos teaching the course I would be interested in taking. I was also considering just talking to him and asking if I could sit in on it. I did that in the past for a course my PI taught and still got something out of it even though I didn't do any of the assignments, but my PI encouraged me to audit at the very least if I did something like that."

&amp;#x200B;

I'm the President of Stanford Students for John Delaney. We're a group of 50+ strong working to elect the best person to beat Trump in 2020. If you're tired of the cronyism, racism, and idiocy that has accompanied the Trump presidency, please sign up to volunteer! Let me tell you a few things about John and our upcoming events:

&amp;#x200B;

**Policy**

This may be his least strong spot. While I typically identify as left-of-Marxist or anarcho-socialist, I do believe that he has the best interests of the people at heart. I'm not going to go into detail here, but you can check out the [issues](https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/) section of his website. His best policy focuses around ending the opioid epidemic, racism, climate change, war, poverty, hunger, and a multitude of important issues. Now to the important stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

**Personal appearance and level of fitness for office**

His smile is so [cute](https://www.ledgertranscript.com/getattachment/dad61b23-9eeb-493e-bffa-d7ec010e1859/pbJohnDelaney-ml-042418-ph1), just look at him :). Also, he's pretty [jacked](https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6e35934/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1322+0+0/resize/2290x1322!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2F87%2Fba%2Ff0aa326a4a779aefcee4d5edfb6b%2Fdelaney-1.jpg), which means that he will be going to the gym at least three times a day to ensure that he's the healthiest president ever.

&amp;#x200B;

**Personal wealth**

He's worth around $250 million, and we all know that politicians who worked in the private sector have the best interests of the general public at heart once they are elected to federal office ;).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure you're all overwhelmed over how great a man John is, but I'll show you how to help him win in 2020! Just go to [this](https://go.johndelaney.com/page/s/volunteer) page and sign up to volunteer. You'll be automatically enrolled for emails from our club.

&amp;#x200B;

We will be doing events all winter quarter, from picketing in White Plaza against Bernie Sanders' lack of a fitness routine and protesting in front of Huang because of Michael Bloomberg's lack of a smile.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Have a great day!"

I recently finished my fall quarter at Stanford and it really, really sucked. Not only did I have a hard time adjusting, but I got a B+/- on almost all my classes this quarter and felt subpar 100% of the time; I also struggled a lot with my mental health and ended up skipping lecture because I didn't feel like leaving my room. Not only do I feel absolutely pathetic about my academic performance this quarter, but I'm also reevaluating my abilities and I'm really scared that the following quarters are going to get worse. I'm scared that I'm not going to be able to land an internship because of my GPA (I want to major in CS and I fucked up my CS class along with other classes because oh well) and I just feel inferior compared to everyone else.

I was hoping to get some tips, grateful in advance for any help you can give :)

First on the application itself: I'm under the impression that being accepted to take SCPD courses as a non-degree student isn't really that competitive a process and so my statement of purpose doesn't really have to be edited to perfection. I have a BS and MS degree in Economics where we did a lot of calculus/linear algebra in minimising different loss functions so I'm hoping I tick the main boxes. Am I right, or is SCPD a lot more competitive to be accepted into than I think? It'd be good to know if so :)

Second on prerequisites: it's been a while since my MS degree and I'm looking to brush up on my math in the few months before the course starts. I recently went through basic calculus, and I gather the most important thing to do next is some linear algebra. I was considering working through either 'introduction to linear algebra' by Strang, or 'linear algebra done right' by Axler. I know they are two different levels of rigour/proof-based-ness, so I was wondering if anyone could say which one is more appropriate as a prerequisite for the CS229 course?

Or maybe I'm way off the mark and there's something better I should do as preparation :)

Thanks in advance for any tips!"

I’m in the Stanford CO 2024 and I’ve never visited campus, my only idea of what the campus is like comes from gilded youtube videos and google maps. Maybe accepting my admittance without knowing the campus was a bad idea, but it’s Stanford and I grew up in California so I’m not expecting much different. 

However, I’m incredibly poor. Like, will need a work-study job as soon as I step foot onto campus poor. My parents have absolutely no money to give me for college, and so I won’t really have access to certain things (like a bike/skateboard to get around) for awhile unless I’m able to secure a scholarship (not banking on it but I’m hopeful?) 

So, my questions for you all are: for the period that I don’t have a bike/skateboard/whatever, is walking around campus difficult/doable? secondly, is public transportation an option? I’ve seen stuff about public transport on Stanford’s website, but I’m not sure how viable it is since whenever I see YouTube videos, people just Über to go to Walmart/Whole Foods or Palo Alto or whatever (their privilege or just the most convenient way? both?)

I’m asking because I saw the case studies from the former Stanford AO and she talks about how she “expected” the musician to send in a musical supplement.

So has anyone “artsy” gotten in without an art portfolio? Thanks so much!!"

Another being valuing what I limit myself to. 
 
Subconsciously we begin to create steps towards the life we most sincerely desire at any given time. Take into consideration a child’s admittance to an institution of higher learning. Considerations pleasing parents an input to this output and realize that daily that looming idea manifests in a broken down series of steps ideal for inciting the admittance. 


This can be elaborated upon to various degrees , and certain variables could be ascribed to specific cases but most certainly from a first principles perspective this is as accurate of a surmise as I can muster.

How manageable is the workload compared to other majors? How social/cooperative do EE students tend to be? How much does GPA matter in EE?  How are the classes and professors?

While arugula may be a controversial choice due to its bitter flavor, I'm glad that after a long day of work I can find solace in a kale, spinach, and arugula salad with Italian dressing.

&amp;#x200B;

The cooked vegetables on the other hand, are a different story. I really appreciate the trend of including bell peppers in more dishes, because they add so much flavor to the dish. I'm a fan of the sautéed chard that they serve at arrillaga.

&amp;#x200B;

HOWEVER, steamed vegetables need to be abolished. Steaming is the absolute worse way to cook anything, it pretty much ensures that it's not going to have any flavor. To guarantee any chance of me consuming a non-arugula or kale vegetable, it's gotta be either grilled or sautéed (with lots of garlic).

Until RD&amp;E commits to not serving any steamed vegetables in the dining hall, I won't eat anything besides some roasted walnuts I have in my sock drawer. Who's with me!?"

I'm a regular decision applicant and having an interview soon. I've got some problems with answering the possible question about why I specifically chose Stanford for economics. 

I know that Stanford's location (in Cali) is perfect, the community and atmosphere is good, the economics program is respected and the finance track fits me well (reasons why I applied to Stanford). However, I'm afraid that my answer would be too superficial as these traits could fit any other top school too (let's say Harvard). 

For example, when I applied to UPenn, I talked about their unique super practical method to teach Econ &amp; business, which can't be found from any other undergrad program, only MBA's. 

So, I'd like to ask current students if You think there are any unique things in Stanford Economics program or Stanford overall. For example, close proximity to Silicon Valley and good history with entrepreneurship might be some things, but I'd like to know if there are some more that I haven't heard about.

We are a team of undergraduate students, medical students, PhD students, medical doctors, and other professionals who are invested in improving the well-being of homeless communities around the world- including yours. H4H was originally founded by students at the University of Central Florida and has since grown into an international organization with over 15 chapters across the United States, Brazil, and India. With your passion, we aim to work with you to help you positively impact your homeless community. Together, we can better fulfill our goal of improving the condition of humanity! 

We are **interested in working with student leaders** who want to innovate, to serve, and to enact change. For student leaders who are interested, all we ask is for your time, leadership, and compassion. We will take care of the rest. The lives you will change, the friends you will make, and the experiences you will gain will be invaluable.

The work of our students has helped so many, and for this reason, it has been recognized by the US Congress, the Brazilian government, President Clinton, educational and medical institutions, and other non-profit institutions as well. Some of our other significant achievements include leading an effort to rescue the homeless in multiple cities from hurricanes, partnering with Shark Tank’s Bombas Socks, as well as being published by [Forbes Magazine](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesnonprofitcouncil/2017/11/06/how-young-leaders-are-strengthening-community-responses-to-disasters/#77391a361850). 

We want to be able to help serve the homeless community in the Stanford and San Jose areas. Just recently, it was discovered that the situation was worse than expected.

Hello,

I am writing to educators, academics, and academic institutions to encourage the adoption of a course of study related to the issue of “ufos” (the most commonly used term though the United Stated government and many others today prefer the term “unidentified aerial phenomenon” or “uap”).

Despite the “breaking news” on this subject since the NY Times report of December 2017 (when they identified a Pentagon UFO study program and released Navy pilot film), signs of a continued avoidance to addressing this subject remain.

Nevertheless, there are beginning signs of a growing recognition of the need to address this, no matter where this leads. In September 2019, Politico’s Bryan Bender noted an interesting statement by the Ranking Member of the House Homeland Security Committee, Matk Walker (R-NC). Walker had been making inquiries in a partially frustrated attempt to determine whether the Chinese or Russians have made an extraordinary and dramatic leap in technology. It appears he may be realizing something else may be happening:

“In a recent interview, Walker, a former pastor, also acknowledged that he is open to the possibility that there are no easy explanations—or the answers could change how humanity perceives the known universe.”

Since preparing a course of study for a long-ignored subject may be a difficult and confusing process at the start, I want to identify a resource that can serve as a good starting point for that:

THE UFO ENCYCLOPEDIA, 3rd Edition, Two Volumes, edited by Jerome Clark. (Make sure you get the 2018 released 3rd edition; published by OMNIGRAPHICS.)

There are very limited UFO courses in a very small number of academic institutions; these may serve as helpful models.

There are also a few expensive online UFO courses of study.

Since I have had 50 plus years of intermittently engaging in a concentrated study of the subject, I began in late May 2019 to write educational content for different aspects of this subject:

http://cosmic-pluralism-studies.academy

As stated there, the material can be freely adopted, or utilized in any way, without attribution.

Finally, it would be great to see academic institutions as a safe refuge for encounter experiencers to relate their experiences in a setting that adheres to strict standards in research, something often lacking in the uncredentialed arena of ufology.

Thankyou for considering this.

I am in a bit of a dilemma. Looking at the AP chart, I have the ability to claim AP credit for Calculus BC, Chemistry, Computer Science A, and Physics 1&amp;2. As a premed, would it be better to claim these credits or not?

I came up with a list of possible pros or cons:

Pros:

* I would place out of potentially difficult general education weeder classes (are premed intro classes at Stanford difficult to succeed in?)
* I would have room to take more classes that interest me and fulfill my requirements faster in time to study for the MCAT

Cons:

* I took the AP exams over a year ago, so my foundation may be weak, setting me up for failure in upper division classes or the MCAT
* If the premed intro classes are relatively easy to succeed in, I could be losing out on potential GPA boost
* Some medical schools may not take AP credits? (Not sure, I haven't looked into it yet)

I was hoping a current or past student could offer some insight into this dilemma. I guess the main concern underlying this decision is: how hard are the premed intro classes, and do they provide a necessary foundation that couldn't be replaced easily?

If anyone has insight on specific tests that I listed, like Computer Science for example, and how doable classes are for someone who claimed AP credit, that would be great as well!"

I am a 27 yrs old CC student in WA. After a several year of spending my time at CC, I aim to apply for Stanford as a transfer student this year! If I do not get it, I may try once more next year.

Anyways, *while I was going through all of the Reddit posts regarding Stanford transfer stories*, I wanted to ask some questions that I personally being concerned about. Please accept my sincere apologies if this post was not suppose to be posted under this subreddit.

1. Due to working full time in the office setting for the very first 1.5 years, more than half of my college transcript is ""part-time"" course basis. I think I only have 3?4? quarters that are considered ""full-time."" Would this fact impact negatively with my chances?
2. In between those 3\~4 full-time quarters, I have 3 quarters of gap. After I took 1 full-time load in the Fall, I got the internship at one of the national laboratories in the Winter quarter. My work ethic was acknowledged from my mentor and was offered an extension until end of the Summer quarter. However, during this experience, I was able to publish a publication. Either way, would this fact, skipping a multiple quarter, also impact negatively?
3. Not to make it sound like so racist or anything; however, is there any Asian transfers at Stanford? I do not know if it's just me or what, but I feel like I couldn't find any Asian people sharing their successful Stanford transfer stories. At this point, I started wondering if Asian people being excluded from the chance. I know that, in regards with transfer process, Stanford values the ""diversity"" the most. However, thinking of how there are lots of Asian students at Stanford, I kind of feel like being an Asian transfer is a HUGE disadvantage that I should not even dream about transferring.

I know these are long and it could be quite sensitive questions too. However, it would be so much appreciated if I could have some insights from the current Stanford students or its alum. Thank you."

I did see on the website, however, that it is possible to transfer credits from your undergrad classes, and was wondering if it would be feasible to start taking various MS&amp;E coterm classes right now, and then transfer it over if I happen to get in, and so end up finishing it in 4 years. This seems kind of wonky, because I would technically be finishing the coterm degree in the space of a few months, having transferred over most of the classes to finish the degree before even technically starting it. However, does anyone know if it would be possible? If not, would there be any other loopholes or ways that I could somehow finish it in 4 years? I don't want to pay for another year of this crazy expensive school lol."

I am a current data scientist at one of the tech companies in the Bay and plan to apply to the Masters in CS program at Stanford, for the HCP version, either by Fall 2020 or 2021. To do so, I was curious about a couple of questions that may help prepare me in my application, if you don’t mind me asking:

&amp;#x200B;

1. If I were apply to the Stanford HCP CS Masters program, is there a greater weight in the CS admissions committee looking at performance of courses that are requisites to the program (CS 103, 110, 109, etc according to the [MSCS program sheet](https://cs.stanford.edu/degrees/mscs/programsheets/psguide1920.pdf) and equivalent course grades if taken in other colleges) or the performance on more advanced courses in CS (graduate school coursework in CS such as 229, 230, 231)? I understand Stanford CS admissions looks at courses more  
holistically so there are no clear-cut rules, but I was curious if anyone has any personal experiences/expertise that they can add to the matter.  


2. Would more recent coursework matter more than older coursework in the CS masters degree application?  


Thanks!"

f6epet,CS Coterm Grades,https://www.reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/f6epet/cs_coterm_grades/,Existing_Swan,1,2020-02-19 10:10:53,7,/r/stanford/comments/f6epet/cs_coterm_grades/,NaN,"So I'm a third-year CS undergrad interested in coterming in CS. My overall GPA is good, but right now my CS gpa is relatively weak for the coterm application (around 3.4-3.5) because of fuckups in 106B (B-), 107 (B-) and 103 (C) from frosh and early sophomore year. However, I have performed well (A or A+) in other courses like 124, 161, 109, and 221. Based on my interests/strengths, I'm on the AI track and am interested in continuing forward on the AI track for my coterm. I'm wondering if I should keep pushing forward taking the classes I find interesting (e.g. 230, 229) in spring/potentially summer quarter, or if I should plan on retaking some of the courses I did poorly in, especially 103.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, is it okay to apply to the coterm program with a high enough CS gpa/high grades in classes that are on the track I'm interested in, or do I need to make sure my ""basics"" like 107/106b/103 are shown to be strong as well -- despite doing well in the courses that include these as prerequisites?"

The course I got into is a niche topic that I'm really interested in. I've seen strong testimonies from past attendees online. Plus, it looks great that everyone writes research papers and receives an evaluation/recommendation from their professor (who is currently an instructor at Stanford) at the end of the program. 

If anyone has any experience with the program, please share it with me! Thanks! (Also, I know this isn't exactly the right forum, but I read in an article that a good chunk of SSHI alumni ended up at Stanford, so I was hoping someone here would be able to help.)"
