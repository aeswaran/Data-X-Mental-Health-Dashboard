cy97v8,Highly requested: A Central UCM Discord (Link in description),https://www.reddit.com/r/ucmerced/comments/cy97v8/highly_requested_a_central_ucm_discord_link_in/,Toum7,16,2019-09-01 05:13:52,1,/r/ucmerced/comments/cy97v8/highly_requested_a_central_ucm_discord_link_in/,NaN,"So we've been using the Bobcat Gaming Discord as a makeshift/placeholder for a general UCM Discord that serves the student body. And seeing that there is a high request for a central Discord and also seeing 5 different UCM Discord servers made, I decided to try to unite them all by making one central Discord here.

Q: Why join this one? 

A: 1.) Verified members- Upon joining we request that you verify that you attend or have attended UC Merced. This is to filter out scammers, lurkers, trolls, doxxers, online stalkers and predators, and other malevolent human beings that don't attend UC Merced and have no say in UC Merced matters.

2.) Official, Central Discord- Like I said before, we've been using Bobcat Gaming as a makeshift general Discord. We will still be using it for gaming but this new one will be used for general campus life as well as gaming. Not to mention, I have seen 4 other small UCM servers that have no verification protection. Some moderators and I will attempt to make this one the main Discord. This will unite all the UCM Discords and verify everyone as students/alumni.

3.) Professionalism and user Friendly- Our moderation team and I have experience moderating big communities (most notably the Discord for Subtle Asian Traits which had over 10,000 active members at one point) as well as interactions and debates. We'll have more cool emotes and we're also planning to boost the server! We're also knowledgeable about campus life.

So come join the UC Merced Discord Server- a school server created by students, ran by students, and for students just like you!

Oh and since it's still in the alpha phase, you'll get a cool ""Founding Member"" badge if you join before this semester ends.  :D"
cyb2qb,California community college student submitting UC TAG for Merced. I took the AP Lang test and one English course in college.

According to various online stats, the majority ethnicity at each campus differs. The list below cites the majority ethnicity at each campus:

[**UC Riverside: Hispanic**](https://www.ucr.edu/about/facts.html)  
[**UC Merced: Hispanic**](http://www.ucmerced.edu/fast-facts)  
[**UC Santa Cruz: White**](http://diversity.ucsc.edu/diversity/images/student_demo_2014.pdf)  
[**UC Santa Barbara: White**](http://bap.ucsb.edu/institutional.research/common.data.set.2014.15.pdf)  
[**UCLA: Asian**](https://www.admission.ucla.edu/campusprofile.htm)  
[**UC San Diego: Asian**](http://studentresearch.ucsd.edu/_files/stats-data/enroll/ugethnic.pdf)  
[**UC Davis: Asian**](https://www.ucdavis.edu/sites/default/files/upload/files/uc-davis-student-profile.pdf)  
[**UC Berkeley: Asian**](http://opa.berkeley.edu/uc-berkeley-fall-enrollment-data)  
[**UC Irvine: Asian**](http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-ln-ucsb-latino-20150127-story.html)

UC Merced publicly prides itself on having a diverse student body and claims it ‚Äúproudly serves the most ethnically and culturally diverse student body among all University of California campuses,‚Äù its website [**states**](http://www.ucmerced.edu/diversity).

UC Merced‚Äôs student ethnic demographics [**show**](http://www.ucmerced.edu/fast-facts) Hispanics make up the lion‚Äôs share of the student body at 3,022 students ‚Äì or 48.5 percent.

Asians and Pacific Islanders come in second at 1,485 students, or 23.8 percent (Middle Eastern students are included in the Asian category if they are U.S. residents). White students place third at 795 students, or 12.7 percent.

üì∑Next up? ‚ÄúNonresident aliens,‚Äù defined as students who are not U.S. citizens ‚Äî either undocumented students or international students. There are 333 such students enrolled, or 5.3 percent of the student population.

After that comes 299 African-American students, which makes up 4.8 percent of the student body. The rest are listed as either ‚Äútwo or more races‚Äù or Native American, and 1 percent ‚Äúdeclined to state.‚Äù

About 99 percent of the student body is from California, with only 24 students [**listed**](http://www.ucmerced.edu/fast-facts) as coming from out of state or a foreign country. That would leave 309 as undocumented students ‚Äì more than the African American student population.

‚ÄúUC Merced welcomes students of all ethnicities and backgrounds, and we are proud of the support that we provide to the highly qualified, UC-eligible first-generation students from our region and elsewhere who often aren‚Äôt exposed to higher education opportunities early on,‚Äù campus spokesperson James Leonard said in an email to *The College Fix*.

He added ‚Äúundocumented students represent all ethnicities and nationalities. We often don‚Äôt know how they identify, which makes it difficult to compare that category to others.‚Äù

[**RELATED:¬†Tired of Racism Claims, UCLA Student Sets Record Straight**](http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/16312/)

UC Merced also has a ‚ÄúHispanic-serving institution‚Äù designation, handed down by the U.S. Department of Education in 2010. That makes the university eligible for a host of funding and grants from the U.S. departments of Education, Agriculture, and Housing and Urban Development. Interestingly, UC Merced does not offer a major in ethnic studies or Chicano/Latino studies.

[**RELATED:¬†Hispanic High School Grads Outpace White Peers in College Enrollment Rates**](http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/13488/)

In some ways, the student population at UC Merced mirrors California‚Äôs demographic trends. Gov. Jerry Brown‚Äôs office [**reported**](http://www.ebudget.ca.gov/2014-15/pdf/BudgetSummary/FullBudgetSummary.pdf) in 2014 that statewide Hispanic residents surpassed whites, coming in at 39 percent compared to 38.8 percent, respectively. Asian residents come in at 13 percent, followed by Black residents at 5.8 percent. Multi-race was 2.6 percent, then came Pacific Islander and American Indian at 1 percent apiece.

‚ÄúAs the Hispanic population in California continues to grow, the proportions of the other race groups will decline slightly, except for Asian, which through immigration should sustain its proportion of the population over the next five years,‚Äù the governor‚Äôs office stated.

When asked whether or not certain ethnic groups at UC Merced appear to be underrepresented, Leonard says ‚Äúit really depends on the context‚Äù and that ‚Äúour distribution of ethnicities is much more similar to that of the San Joaquin Valley than of California as a whole.‚Äù

According to the most recent stats available online, white students are not the most represented demographic at at least six other UC campuses as well, but none of the campuses have such a small percentage of Caucasian students as UC Merced except for UC Riverside, which has a white student population of 15.6 percent, according to its [**website**](https://www.ucr.edu/about/facts.html).

Cats are okay, 420 friendly, quiet household, friendly roommates, 15 min walk to 2 bus stops.

I'm a prospective freshman planning on double majoring Anthropology and Cogsci BS. Merced really interested me because I'm planning to go into academia research/teaching, and it's a tiny, affordable campus with the same great research faculty as any other UC but no impacted classes. 

I found a great webpage for undergraduate psychology research, but nothing similar for anthropology. Does anyone have any experience with anthropology professors here, and are they willing to work with undergraduates? Any interesting projects going on? Thanks!"

Students at UCSC have been engaging in a wildcat strike since December of last year to fight for a cost of living adjustment as a result of wage stagnation amidst unchecked housing cost inflation and one of the highest costs of living in the United States.

Our strike has been growing, and solidarity movements have popped up at several other UC campuses, as well as a number of campuses nationwide. We were even endorsed last night by Senator Bernie Sanders.

You can find out more about the strike at [https://payusmoreucsc.com/](https://payusmoreucsc.com/), and of course, please join us below and ask us anything!

I am a high school senior who is anxiously awaiting the results of my UC decisions; however I had just received an email from the UC Merced Admissions saying this, 

""As an applicant to the University of California for the Fall 2020 term, you have embarked on an exciting journey to find the best possible education, and I applaud your hard work. The University of California is committed to providing a place for all UC-eligible California residents. Because you have been recognized as an accomplished student, I am reaching out to you today to invite you to add UC Merced to your campus choices at no additional cost through our Grow with UC Merced program.""

I was wondering if this is different or the same to the UC Merced Count Me In program? If anyone has any insight on this, I'd really appreciate it! Thanks! :)"
