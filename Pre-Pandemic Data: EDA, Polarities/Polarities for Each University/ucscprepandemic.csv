cy75a3,Has anyone ever ubered to SF before?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/cy75a3/has_anyone_ever_ubered_to_sf_before/,Siksor83,7,2019-09-01 00:35:33,13,/r/UCSC/comments/cy75a3/has_anyone_ever_ubered_to_sf_before/,NaN,"I need to go to San Francisco in December and I don’t have a license. I’ve taken a greyhound there before so I was looking at tickets again, but they all arrive too late and I need to be there at 8:30 am. When it gets closer to the date I’ll probably look into ride shares, but honestly I doubt I’ll be able to find anyone for a random trip to SF on a Wednesday. So basically, do you guys think uber is possible? To avoid stressing out the driver, if I left at like 6 I could uber to San Jose, then take another uber to like, Palo Alto, then maybe another one to San Mateo, then finally to SF. It’s only an hour drive normally but leaving at 6 would give me 2.5 hours. Y’all think it’s doable?"

I talked to a counselor today. I was supposed to make a student education plan. She said as a chemistry major transferring to UCSC, I don't need to take any MATH CLASSES. She said my basic Calculus 101A was enough, and I did not need to take any more math classes. But the UCSC website says I need :

* MATH 22, Introduction to Calculus of Several Variables or AM 30, Multivariate Calculus for Engineers
* MATH 11A and 11B, Calculus with Application
* MATH 19A and 19B, Calculus for Science, Engineering, and Mathematics

I'm trying to do a TAG to UCSC. I have a 3.0 GPA which can go up to a 3.5 GPA eventually by the summer of 2019. I was hoping to transfer by Fall 2020, but I don't even know if that's possible. I am a chemistry major. 

Are there any chemistry majors at UCSC who transferred from a community college? Which classes did you take? Also, I am nearly done with my IGETC- Plan C. 

Is my counselor seriously telling me the truth about not needing any math classes? My commmunity college has a reputation for counselors who don't really care... (Some).

I'm a freshman that's gonna be moving in in 2ish weeks. You can read from the third  paragraph for the actual question, but here's some background if you need it. Basically I ended up here currently under earth science major bc my asian parents wanted me to apply to all UCs. I kind of purposely screwed up the applications so my mom would be like ""I guess God doesn't want you to go to Berkeley or UCLA"" and let me pursue concept art. 

I also applied to accd for ED concept with a portfolio I photobashed and trashed and smashed together horribly in 2 weeks (didn't think I'd get in even if I had worked hard bc my skill level wasn't high enough) and didn't really try hard at all. soMehOw, I got within the top 5ish basically on waitlist to get into their class of usually 24-34 people. I got accepted into their Illustration program w/ fiat scholarship, but knowing I was so close to their eliter track is worth the rework. So now I'm currently *actually* working on my entry portfolio for spring 2020 with a mentor from AC and a AC summer class. People who've looked at my portfolio said they're confident I'll get in and get a decent scholarship. Figure drawing, matte painting, 3d, photobashinggggg :D are strengths, and lineart...almost non-existent, shameful, absolutely necessary, I'm a dishonor to my family, I really need to work on it.


 If I get into ACCD spring 2020, it means I'm only here for 1 quarter. I'm currently enrolled in planetary earth science, mandatory core, and math 19A. Core will help me get rid of writing intensive at AC since I did horrible on all my writing AP tests. Cinema history is the other credit at AC I can get rid of, but collides with core, so I can't do that anyways. Planetary earth science will help with functionality, and it's also something I really want to take. I signed up for 19A bc it's a prereq for earth science, but I'm really not looking forward to it. I'm wondering if I should try switching out math 19A for one of your game design courses to get more connections, since I know ILM junior concept artists work in the bay. However, I know I need something to challenge my Irvine tryhard brain after I submit my portfolio on Oct 1. or else it'll turn wrinkly and old without the stress of learning something. To counter attack the however: however, I live in LA. Glendale and all the entertainment connections one would ever need is right here for me already. Is it worth? I know the classes are completely full, but hypothetically, would it be better for me to do an game design art course than take math 19A?"

 Everyone that I know who has transferred to a UC has also finished OCHEM beforehand. I have emailed the senior admissions advisor at UCSC and he also stated it was highly recommended to complete the series.

&amp;#x200B;

I took CE100/L, a GE, and another major class that had no lab.

I failed CE100 and it's lab because of super unforeseen personal circumstances.

But, I passed my other two classes( P and an A- ), so my term GPA was around a 1.2ish and I got academic my probation.  

My cumulative GPA however was still pretty health sitting around at a 3.2ish 

&amp;#x200B;

But now that I'm checking my financial aid I'm missing two UCSC scholarships  :( 

The terms said that as long as I stayed in Good academic standing I would get my scholarships. But it also said that it was still valid if my GPA was above 3.0.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to visit Financial Aid , but I'm dreading the worse.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to ask if anyone here has gone through a similar thing and how they resolved it.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks Reddit"

We have a wireless printer that we can bring. However, the way it works is that it’s basically visible to anyone on the WiFi network it’s on and anyone can print on it. The usual solution would be a small WiFi network for just the dorm room, e.g. using a WiFi router in the room. Then only the people in the room would see the printer when they’re on that WiFi network.

However, College 9/10 is WiFi-only with UCSC ResNet, and they say personal routers are not allowed. How do people use wireless printers in the dorms with only ResNet WiFi, a huge shared WiFi network? Would your own printer be visible to everyone? When you go to print on your iPad, do you see tons of other people’s wireless printers in the dorm on AirPrint? Or is there some way to manage that?

I have about 45 RPG books that are sitting on my shelf... I'm familiar with most of them. We could run practically any genre/setting we wanted but that all depends on what the group wants. Off the top of my head, I have

\- Vampire/Werewolf/Changeling/Mage: urban fantasy where you play as monsters/faeries/wizards

\- Things From The Flood: you play as teens in Sweden in the 90s investigating the paranormal, think Stranger Things

\- Blades in the Dark: play a band of criminals in a dirty fantasy city

\- Traveller/Stars Without Number: classic sci-fi 

\- Ars Magica: play as old-timey mythic medieval wizards

\- Genesys/FATE: play anything we want! they're systems designed for you to play your own setting 

&amp;#x200B;

All skill levels welcome. It might sound like a lot but I'd be happy to teach anyone who's interested! 

I'll be hitting up the tabletop club once the quarter starts, too."

d6czh9,Do I need to remove my accommodations if I don’t need them anymore?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/d6czh9/do_i_need_to_remove_my_accommodations_if_i_dont/,86FlipFlop86,2,2019-09-19 04:58:21,4,/r/UCSC/comments/d6czh9/do_i_need_to_remove_my_accommodations_if_i_dont/,NaN,"Freshman year (third year now) I was having a really hard time and saw a CAPS therapist for like 4 months. He determined I probably had bipolar disorder and sent me to the DRC office, where I got accommodations for attendance, a single room for a discounted price, and priority enrollment times for classes. The reasoning behind these accommodations was that if I’m manic/depressed sometimes I can’t make it to class (which is really the only one I’ve used), a single room for cheap because having a roommate with a different sleeping schedule was waking me up all night and making me manic, and priority enrollment times so that if I get on medication that makes it hard for me to wake up, then I could have an easier time avoiding morning classes. 

However, I feel really bad having these accommodations when the only one I use is the attendance one. I’ve lived off campus for the past two years so I haven’t needed to use the single room accommodation. I was sent to a psychiatrist but she pissed me off so I never got on medication, so the priority enrollment one isn’t needed. Plus every quarter I procrastinate the shit out of class enrollment and basically just take whatever’s left the day before the enrollment deadline. 

So, do I need to actually go to the DRC office and ask to have these removed? Is there harm in keeping them? I ask because I’m worried they’ll want paperwork saying I’m not mentally ill or whatever but CAPS has become way more crowded and you’re lucky to even get 3 appointments now a days, which obviously isn’t enough to prove you’re not mentally ill. And I am mentally ill, I’m still a mess since I’m not on meds, so I don’t even know what a therapist could do. 

I know this is a very specific problem but I’m just wondering if anyone here has insight into how the DRC works or removing accommodations. I just feel really guilty having the ones I don’t use I guess. I’ll probably go talk to them when I get back in town but I thought I’d post here just in case."

~I WILL go to Mission Hill Creamery a block down and buy you ice cream as a thank you for coming with me
~I'm a musician as well (one of those cringey ""SoundCloud Rappers"") and a big gaming nerd (my major is Comp Sci Game Design, going into my capstone year) but I can hold many a conversation about other things
~I'm friendly!! I promise!!

Just saying- it doesn’t hurt to think before you speak to your peers about going to UCSC - nothing wrong with rankings and all, but making assumptions and jabs isn’t cool.

It collects a bunch of information about your computer, but privacy concerns aside, it's just annoying. You're required to install an antivirus program from an approved list, which is pretty short, and doesn't include Windows Defender. 

You can avoid using Safeconnect pretty easily, and I strongly recommend it:

* install a user agent switcher extension in your browser (like [this one](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-switcher-revived/) for Firefox or [this one](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-agent-switcher/dbclpoekepcmadpkeaelmhiheolhjflj?hl=en) for Chrome/Chromium derivatives).

* Connect to the resnet network, and when it asks you to login/check compliance, click the extension button and use it to change your user agent to ""Firefox on Ubuntu"". This ""tricks"" the webpage into thinking you're running Ubuntu, which they don't distribute Safeconnect for. Therefore, it lets you login without the safeconnect/antivirus check. You can force it to redirect you to the login page by navigating to a website that doesn't use SSL, like [neverssl.com](http://neverssl.com).

* refresh the page and login with your UCSC credentials. 

* once logged in, change your user agent back to default. 

* browse the internet as normal, and use whatever antivirus setup you please."

(this is long be ready lol)

1) be an Extrovert! this one was so hard for me since i’m a shy kid most of the time, but i wish someone would have told me to just take chances and talk to people you think are cool! it may seem impossible and scary but i swear to you this, here are the 2 pillars of freshman year socialization: nobody cares and everyone is just as scared as you are! reaching out to acquaintances and strangers is the ONLY way to really widen your world and meet so so many interesting people 

2) ask your RA! this is usually something your parents say to you so that you can ask strangers on reddit instead! much less face time with more campus strangers! but seriously, asking my RA for help with the “dumb questions” saved me so much time and energy. they won’t laugh at you, but if they do then remember that it’s only so you can laugh at the same freshies a year later! 

3) finally, oh man, Fill Your Calendar! do everything that looks interesting! go to KZSC (radio station) meetings and as soon as it ends then jet off to a art club if that sounds fun to you. I really can’t emphasize this point enough. The busier you make yourself with coffee dates, room hangouts, and clubs, then you’ll have more opportunities to make friends and have a fun ass year! It may seem overwhelming and you might want to give up and lay in your dark dorm room, but fight that urge with all you got.

**You are invited to join Replication Markets (RM) for Social Science**

**Replication Markets, with your help, is predicting outcomes** of 3,000 social and behavioral science experiments that might be undertaken over the next year. We seek scholars with different voices and perspectives to create a wise and diverse crowd, and hope you will join us. 

[Sign up!](https://predict.replicationmarkets.com/main/#!/users/register?referral_id=r1)

We invite you - your students, and any other interested parties - to join our crowdsourced prediction platform. By mid-2020 we will rate the replicability of claims from more than [60 academic journals](https://www.replicationmarkets.com/index.php/frequently-asked-questions/list-of-journals/). The claims were selected by an independent team that will also randomly choose about 200 for testing (replication).  


• **RM's forecasters bet on the chance that a claim will replicate** and may adjust their assessment after reading the original paper and discussing results with other players. Previous replication studies have demonstrated prediction accuracy of about 75% with these methods.  
• **RM’s findings will contribute to the wider body of scientific knowledge** with a high-quality dataset of claim reliabilities, comparisons of several crowd aggregation methods, and insights about predicting replication. Anonymized data from RM will be open-sourced to train artificial intelligence models and speed future ratings of research claims.  
• **RM’s citizen scientists predict experimental results** in a play-money market with real payouts totaling over $100K\*. Payouts will be distributed among the most accurate of its anticipated 500 forecasters. There is no cost to play the Replication Markets.  


**Our project needs forecasters like you with knowledge, insight, and expertise in fields across the social and behavioral sciences.** Please share this invitation with colleagues, students, and others who might be interested in participating. **We hope to see you in the markets!**  


**On behalf of the Team at Replication Markets,**

I have no problem getting up at 4:30am and know I am disciplined enough to budget studying time wisely. 

I don't need to be lectured about why this isn't a good idea, I just need to know I won't be late to class (aside from the rare mudslide in winter). My only concern is how reliable the bus is (technically two buses bc I will also bus from the SC metro station to campus).  It's also worth noting I have friends who live in SC that I can stay with the night before an exam so I won't risk being late, though if I can avoid bothering them I will. 

Again, I have done my research on the costs of the bus vs living in SC and I know the commute is a pain. I just want to know if I can arrive on time reliably."

**In the morning of Tuesday at 9am in 2015** Six UCSC students blocked the Highway 1 southbound right here Highway 17 merges at where what's known as the ""fishhook"" and thus completely disrupting traffic, commute to work,  local businesses/companies on both sides of the hill to bring awareness to Tuition Hikes and Black Lives Matter. It took police and firefighters five hours to break apart PVC pipes protesters had their chain-locked arms in, through a garbage can with 700lbs of cement.

I'm understanding of causes, but disagree with certain methods. In this case  I thought this trivialized the seriousness and movement which they said to have protested for. Focus on one cause, and stick with it. Tuition hikes, Police Brutality  and Black Lives Matter?.. Might as well throw rent control, our opioid problem, homelessness, white supremacy, or anything else that would further water down whatever issues they wanted to bring acknowledgement towards. Regardless, the outcome of this were some of the protesters having regrets, one with a felony and the other five misdemeanors. Locals here feel already feel a certain way towards UCSC students by the way.[https://www.ksbw.com/article/police-arrest-6-uc-santa-cruz-students-highway-1-reopens/1056102#](https://www.ksbw.com/article/police-arrest-6-uc-santa-cruz-students-highway-1-reopens/1056102#)

**Every year there are different protests/picket lines** that consists of both entrances to the campus being blocked by students whiles classes were still in session. My experience: I get off the bus with my bike from base of campus and ride up, protesters won't negotiate/budge. There seem to be a lot of tension in the air or some sort of preparedness for exchanges of words as if that's what has been going on all day.. It was hot and sweaty, quiet, and a lot of them looked tired and fatigue. I tell them to stay hydrated as I ride off and took the dirt road on my bike to get to class (more longer and tiring). I made it to class, out of breath and met with classmates who conveniently live on campus to get to class. As I ride off they a handful of them said thank you collectively in appreciation upon reminding them to stay hydrated. While I was there another guy insisted on getting through the linked-arm picket line.. they wouldn't budge. So he broke his way through and manage to disconnect the armed linkage between protesters and kept on his business while student protesters were shouting and berating him.

Guaranteed a protest will happen, how you handle or engage is up to you. Funny thing is I don't know if anything ever changed or if these protests had any influences in any decision makings regarding what they were protesting for. I had a friend share with me that some girl was running amok up and down the dorms barbarically knocking on everybody's door including her door, waking her up to have her join in on their protests during dead week (week before finals). I'll leave it up to your imagination on how that 'conversation' went as well as how interactions between ""join me in this protest"" girl and students on her floor were for the rest of the year.

F1/10 is a great opportunity for more advanced programmers to learn to work with technologies like LIDAR and computer vision. 

No prior experience is required to join Slugbotics.

&amp;#x200B;

Today is a sad day for me. I lost my wallet which had my student ID in it along with other important cards in it. It looks exactly like the one in the picture attached.

I lost it sometime today as I was walking from my dorm in the Rachel Carson AG building to the Thimann Lecture Hall 1. I'm not quite clear if I lost it on the walk there or in the hall itself. I've walked up and down my route twice now and I've rechecked the hall. I could really use a fresh pair of eyes to help me here. If you see it or hear anyone talk about it please post here or email me at [ngarias@ucsc.edu](mailto:ngarias@ucsc.edu).

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so much for your help and have a good one."

For some of you santa Cruz will be the place and for other's it wont. What I mean is for some of you this place will matter and for others no other place will ever matter on the same level as here. And honestly both are perfectly fine, if you get your education here and then move on to a good career and a happy life after santa Cruz fuck yeah good for you. For others if this town, this school shape the rest of your life that is also perfectly fine. Never let someone elses truth take away from what matters to you.

Ucsc and santa Cruz give you the gift of red woods and oceans, of mountain biking and surfing, of hard core computer science and amazing philosophy. As someone that has lived and loved Santa Cruz then left and came back the only ideas that you should fear or fight against are the ones that make you catigorize yourself. Be everything and nothing, honestly just do your best to be happy and burn everything else.

In my eyes this town and this school are an amazing gift in a world of hard borders and harder beleifs. The ucsc republicans might be an annoying group of trolls or freedom fighters for free speech; but the important thing is that in this place people get to decide not dogma no matter what it seems. This school, this town, this idea, face hard times right now, living here is fucking impossible, land owners are rich and lost, people are suffering, but here maybe more then anywhere else provides a chance to make things better. No matter what you believe never give up on the idea that together through arguments and name calling and bullshit, people, all people working togethe can make life I little but better then it was yesterday.

Santa Cruz isn't Berkeley and it never should be, from my personal favorite writer ""Now that you don't have to be perfect you can be good."" What I took from ucsc more then anything was be you the best you that you can ever be and if the world doesn't like tell them to get fucked.

Hope this wasn't to preachy, I just love this place/school and am trying to deal with the fact I might have to leave soon.

I love you slugs each and everyone of you and hope you find the happiness we are all looking for."

This is my last year and both my winter and spring quarters are packed with 3 upper divs. 

If I drop technical writing then I'll have to take 4 upper divs next quarter which I think it's not possible but if I drop 141(feedback control) I'll have to take it next fall. The reason why I don't want to extend a quarter is that the tuition is way too high for international students.

&amp;#x200B;

Did anyone make it through the quarter with the same combination? Any advice is appreciated!"

I've made a post willing to offer help/answer questions in the past which some people found useful, and now that school at started again I figured I'd post once more! Although since I graduated 3 years ago I'm now getting a bit distant from UCSC. 

**Frequently Asked Questions**

* What was your GPA/MCAT? - 3.85 and a 35 (~517 on new exam)
* Where do I get clinical experience in Santa Cruz? - Dominican hospital and Sutter take volunteers (I'm sure others do too), but it can be hard to get a spot. Consider EMT, scribe work, or medical assistant work. Salinas isn't too far south, and if you're willing to go over the hill San Jose may offer opportunities. Other volunteering activities may satisfy your clinical exposure/experience needs as well!
* Does my major matter to med schools? - No it does not. You do not need a science major (about 40% of med students were non-science majors). The perceived difficulty of your major is also meaningless (high GPA with easy major beats lower GPA with a ""hard"" major every time)
* How hard is it to stay in California for med school? - Very hard. We send about 2/3rds of our medical students out of state. There are very few CA spots compared to CA applicants. But other states are cool too!
* Physics series 6 or series 5? - I took series 6 since 5 is reported to be harder due to the higher math burden. So take the easier series! If these have changed since I graduate I apologize. 
* Is 2 quarters of general chem lab enough to satisfy the ""1 year"" requirement of medical schools? - The answer the generally that if your undergrad considers it a year then it is. At UCSC the general chem year long series is 3 lectures and 2 labs so it does count. Again I apologize if UCSC has changed since I left.

I was confused, I had worked so hard to get here and I really wanted to be here but now that I was, I was having one of the toughest times of my life. I failed some classes, I had issues with financial aid, I was having a hard time finding friends, and I didn’t know what I wanted to major in anymore. I felt lost and hopeless. I got this far and was ready to give up and go home. Last year I had to leave campus, it was involuntary but for the better. I had issues with financial aid and lost my housing. I was gone for two quarters and it gave me time to think about everything and figure out what I wanted, and that I needed help. I missed school, so I took some classes at a cc during the summer to show UCSC I was ready to return and do better. I was readmitted (when I left I wasn’t in good academic standing). I started taking my meds, I started eating better and gained some weight, I figured out what I wanted to major in after taking a sociology course during my time away. I’m still working on coming out of my shell and making friends, I’m still working on my GPA, I’m making sure I eat the way I should, and getting academic and medical help when I need it. Sometimes you need a break, sometimes you have to ask for help and that’s okay. I realized people would kill to be at UCSC and that I worked so hard to be here and didn’t want to waste it. If you’re going through anything like this, I just wanted to say that everything will turn out fine. Trust and take care of yourself. Take time off if you need it, don’t be ashamed to ask for help, and don’t be so hard on yourself. Everyone doesn’t have it together like you might think, and no one comes to college knowing exactly what they want, no one is expecting you to either. I hope you find your way soon. College isn’t as bad as it seems, it’s hard, but you’ll get there. I’m here for you if you need someone because I was that someone."

So I am making a casual horseback club with trainers that supports both english and western saddles as I am in contact with trainers that should cover most disciplines. 

We have no mandatory dues to a larger organization (if you want to form a competitive team with other members you can, its just not mandatory to be in the club)

no minimum training requirement per month and no long term commitment (no mandatory bulk lessons to be in the club) meaning you ride with others when you want to and in what discipline you want. If you want to just try it once and see if you like it, we can help you do that.

no minimum skill level required to join

all genders and identities are welcome to join, we push the diversity of equestrian disciplines where there is a discipline for everyone. 

The cost and barrier to entry into the sport are reduced for those that just want to get in and have fun.

Basically, it takes all the hard work of getting into it away and gives beginners or out-of-area riders a great jumping off point to start riding with no pressure or commitment and with much less financial burden. This is huge because western saddle trainers are rare in Norcal and previously if you were a western rider you were SOL in SC unless you called every stable in the county. It gives beginners the ability to train in what they want easily, and with no judgements.

Would anyone be interested in a club like this?"

Oakes SUCKS so bad and I need to get out. Before you downvote me for being whiny and complainly, pls just hear me out.

I don't know if other colleges are aware of this, but the walls in Oakes are PAPER THIN, literally there is nothing in the walls to block sound. I can literally hear EVERYTHING that goes on in my building, upstairs, downstairs, down the hall, everything. Someone swipes their ID card to open their door down the hallway? SWIPE!!!!!! I can hear it like their swiping the card in my EAR. Someone takes a piss in the toilet 10 feet down the hallway? PSHHHHH it's like they're pissing in my ear.

And actually, the worst part is the doors. The doors slam so hard by themselves man, I can't explain it to you through words. Every 5 seconds throughout the day there is a ""BANG"" or a ""BOOM"" from someone opening and closing a door. ESPECIALLY the doors that open from the outside of the building. You can hear the entrance doors throughout the whole building, I am not kidding. It does not matter where you are situated in the building, you can hear the entrance doors slamming from ANYWHERE. And I can literally FEEL the door slamming every 5 seconds, my room shakes like a earthquake atomic bomb dude. It's like I'm in a warzone, someone call the military PLSSSSSS.

So basically, how am I supposed to sleep/study with this nonsense? The only quiet time is like from 1AM-6AM. I guess I am supposed to sleep 5 hrs now huh. They need to rennovate oakes college rlly badly. If you guys think I am exaggerating you should come live in my dorm and I will live in yours and you will feel my pain.

On top of all this the kids are EXTREMELY rowdy, even for the average college kid, the kids here are worse. I am trying to transfer to colleges 9/10 but the adviser said I can't apply until Oct 7th, and even then I don't know if I will get a room. PLS HELP what should I do? What can I do to lower sound or block out sound? What can I do to transfer out of this college? ANY ADVICE IS APPRECIATED TY!!!"

I live in a house with six other roommates, four of which who can seemingly drink/smoke any time of the day. I'm totally cool with that as long as they keep the noise levels down. 

Right now I'm taking hard upper division classes as well as need to wake up early. They know this, but keep having people over on the weeknights during the time I would like to study/go to bed. I've tried talking to them, they said they would bring it outdoors or what not but people keep coming back in. 

Last night was especially bad, they invited what looked like 20-30 people who all hungout in the living next to my bedroom until I had to come out and ask them to go outdoors. 

I'm tired of asking my housemates to be more considerate of me and my roommate. I feel like an annoying parent who's just trying to get work done and its giving me a ton of anxiety. 

Please please please, give me some advice on how to handle this situation, I just want to sleep.

I don't know if you remember me, but in the spring of 2018 I was taking your Discrete Mathematics class. It was one of the most engaging classes I'd taken that year, my freshman year. In the middle of the quarter I came down with a really nasty case of the flu. I had a temp of 104 for 7 days straight and missed all of my classes of course. I came back after and asked you for help and you gave me the truth that I'd fail the quarter. However you offered me an incomplete instead and I took it and passed the next quarter with a B+.

Unfortunately I failed a lot of other classes due to other unrelated circumstances and was barred. I went home and did a year of community college and was eligible for readmission. Your kindness and care was a huge part of what inspired me to become readmitted. Here I am, back and enrolled for the fall quarter as well as the foreseeable future.

Thanks for being such an amazing professor, I hope to see you in a classroom again soon!

Welcome! I suspect for many of these people it's their first time being in a gym before based on some things I see them do. I thought I would make a post for people who have never been to a gym before so we can strive towards a cleaner and more considerate gym environment for everyone.

1. **Wipe down your equipment!** If you use a machine or bench, it's crucial to wipe off your nasty sweat after. There are spray bottles of cleaner and rags as well as trash cans with gym wipes on top all around both floors of OPERS gym. The bottles and rags are usually attached to pillars and closer to walls than the middle of the gym. *Please* use them. Nobody wants to clean up somebody else's ass sweat!
2. **Re-rack your weights.** Remember where you picked up your dumbbell, barbell, kettlebell or plate? Perfect! Put it back when you're done. This ensures that others can easily find it and use it when you are done and that the floor is free of tripping hazards.
3. **Get off of a machine or put away equipment if you're not using it!** Everyone needs to take a short break between reps sometimes, but try to avoid sitting on a machine staring at your phone for several minutes straight. Other people want to use it too!

These are the the three most essential things to keep in mind at the gym in my opinion. Doing these three simple things helps the gym be a cleaner and more functional place for everyone including yourself. Now go get those gains (and wipe your equipment, rack your weights, and keep track of time)!"

I am currently in my second year here at Canada College I will be applying this year to transfer next fall as a Computer Science major BA. My first question is will I be considered competitive since I am taking the new transfer requirements that consist of python, Computer assembly line and arch, and C++. I believe that the majority of the people applying for next fall will be taking intro to Java, data structures in Java and discrete math. The reason that I am asking this question is that If I were to take the old requirements, I will have to take the courses that I am currently taking at Canada once I transfer to UCSC. My only concern is the course articulation why you may ask is that here at Canada there is only one python course but it articulates to CSE 20 instead of CSE 30, CSE 30 is a new requirement to transfer here at UCSC. I have been informed that I can test out of it which I forgot if it is either CSE 20 or CSE 30. Another course that is in the new requirements is CSE12/12L, here at Canada there is only one Computer assembly line and arch but it has never been articulated to CSE12/12L. If this two courses were not to be articulated, will I still be admitted even though there is no courses that are articulated to CSE 30 and CSE 12/12L at any community college near me like CSM and not having the minimum GPA which is 2.8 in at least 3 courses that will be completed by the end of this semester."

I’m wondering if the transfer students have any advice or insight on what it’s like being a transfer at UCSC. In addition, what’s the housing like? I’m not sure how the housing situation works. I really like college nine and ten but do they house transfers? Or just freshmen? And for those of you who were admitted as a four year student, do you notice the transfers? Are they left out? 

I’m sorry for the long ass post but I think my pride is getting the best of me.

Hi y'all!  So now that we have confirmed that UCSC is included in the imminent power shutoff, I want to share some information on steps to take now to prepare.  



Keep in mind that this is anticipated to be an extended shutoff that can very easily roll over into multiple days.  This is largely because PG&amp;E needs to physically inspect their grid after the weather warning to make sure turning power back on doesn't spark wildfires.  



WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I DIDN'T PREPARE?

PG&amp;E will be hosting a Community Resource Center at Twin Lakes Church, 2701 Cabrillo College Drive, Aptos.  95003.  This location will provide the following services for up to 100 people at a time:

•	Restrooms

•	Bottled Water 

•	Electronic Device Charging

•	Air Conditioned Seating

Google Maps Link:  https://goo.gl/maps/C23hwkgXHc1qM92h6



WHAT UCSC STRUCTURES ARE LIKELY TO HAVE POWER STILL?

•	Dining Halls (back-up generators)

•	Jack Baskin Engineering

•	Communications Building 

•	Cowell Student Health Center 

•	Earth and Marine Sciences

•	East Field House 

•	Cogen Plant 

•	Fire Station 

•	Natural Sciences 2 

•	Interdisciplinary Sciences Building 

•	Center for Adaptive Optics 

•	Sinsheimer Labs 

•	Science Library

•	Thimann Labs 



WHAT STEPS SHOULD I TAKE?

1)	Take an inventory of the items that you need that rely on electricity

2)	Keep your freezers and refrigerators closed, utilize food supplies that do not require refrigeration.

3)	Charge (and keep charged) your mobile phones/devices.

4)	Make sure that all of your stovetops are turned off.

5)	Get in the know with local alerts and radio.

6)	Turn off or disconnect appliances, equipment, or electronics.  This equipment can be harmed or incur a hazard if they are left on when the power is restored (ie, a power surge).

7)	If you have time, build an emergency preparedness kit.

8)	Prepare emergency lighting (great if you have a flashlight!)

Did you guys hear the news? China has stopped accepting US recycling. Furthermore, our recycling is far too contaminated for our facilities to be capable of processing it.

With the campus's reputation for being ""green"" I consider this a little unacceptable...  

I am curious if most people are even aware of what's happening and if anybody would be interested in brainstorming a solution"

Lastly, bathrooms are litteraly a couple of seconds away, and the dining hall is just around the corner, which is nice.

When I walked in and turned to the stairs I realized I've been walking up those stairs everyday since PG&amp;E shut down the school so I did a 180 and stood at the elevator bay. Once we got in I stood in the back and just zoned out in your direction  looking at the numbers go up. I had no intention so i'm really sorry if it seemed as if I did.

We cool?

The chair used to be in a law office conference room (Not at someone's desk), the cushion is still in brand new condition, basically un-used.

These are apparently anywhere between $500-1000+ per chair from their official website which is insane. This shit is a real genuine and comfortable leather chair. Will last you forever. 

Details: Nice cushion on the back, it keeps you in good posture, can lean back, the base is metal not plastic, real leather.

This is the website's description of the chair: *"" The Glove Executive chair is a luxurious leadership chair that combines pillow-top padding with the richness of classic tufted leather seating. Boasting an abundance of foam padding and folds of leather, the Glove Executive is the seat of comfort for the head of a conference table in the boardroom or the corner office ""*

I've been in college for 7 years but haven't made a single friend. But I'm so terrified of talking to people that I'd rather stay alone than approach a stranger which will probably result in creeping them out anyway. I'm a 25 year old fat creepy virgin loser and I think people can tell that right away. I don't drink or do drugs or party either...I think people want fun friends who want to go out and do things and that's just not me. I can't imagine why anyone would want to be friends with me. I have less personality than cardboard. People must make new friends by approaching someone they don't know right? So why in 7 years has no one ever approached me just to say hi? Must be because i don't look like someone you'd want in your life. Oh well...i guess I shouldn't think this way and just be thankful im alive. My expectations of life are too high sometimes :/

Enrollment for Covered California has started but they denied me from obtaining insurance through their marketplace. I don’t know why this is. They won’t even let me apply for Medi-Cal. An appeal will take 90 days. 

I have a lot of health problems so I’ve been saving up to buy a halfway decent plan but they just won’t even give me the option to do so. I tried reaching out directly to insurance companies to purchase from them privately, but they have few to no options for me. And I don’t mean their options are out of my price range, they are basically offering almost nothing at all outside of Covered California. 

I am not jumping right into full time work, so I won’t have benefits yet, but in the meantime I need *something.* Most plans won’t even become effective until January 1st, either way. For those of us with preexisting conditions that’s kind of stressful that our insurance runs out in September but we don’t have options until January? 

Has anyone navigated this successfully? Any suggestions?"

divbbz,Advice for getting interviews/leads for those without experience,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/divbbz/advice_for_getting_interviewsleads_for_those/,ReignNFire,32,2019-10-16 13:32:59,10,/r/UCSC/comments/divbbz/advice_for_getting_interviewsleads_for_those/,NaN,"Hey! 

I’m a recent graduate from here and just wanted to shed some light on a tactic I don’t see talked about much, dealing with finding leads and getting interviews. It’s peak hiring season from now till basically February, so if you’re not on the job hunt, I really suggest you should unless you want to struggle to find a job after college (like me lol). Take this from someone that’s been trying everything to get my name out there to people, such as going to tech events, cold-calling/emailing, LinkedIn everyday, you name it I feel I might have done it to get noticed by people in hiring positions.

Anyways, here it is: GO TO OTHER CAREER FAIRS BESIDES UCSC. 
 
When I went to UCSC, I would only go to the CECI fair since I was in CS. Honestly, it was an absolute waste of time, because you were in huge lines competing with others every which way, and recruiters most likely forgot you after you’re done talking. I would say I’m a good talker, had project experience, no internship at the time, so basically without a past internship(s) (preferably 2) experience going in, I was screwed since the companies there were bigger name companies who preferred experience heavily. So ditch the CECI fairs or honestly any fair at UCSC until you have an internship, this is where the other fairs around California (CSU FAIRS) matter. Go to them!

I went to one last week and omg it was crazy how so much better it was for me. I got to talk to recruiters, sometimes they came out to me to greet me, and we’d just chat and I’d tell them what I’m interested in. I’d tell them about my projects, my courses, and what was most important to them was how I presented myself. I was complimented on my attitude and told to reach back out to the recruiters on so many occasions. I got 2 interviews lined up now because of this. 

CSU fairs are great and you won’t be going against stiff competition and it gives you a lot of interview practice because there are no long lines (longest line I was in had 4 people lol). There is one caveat though: THESE FAIRS MIGHT NOT ALL BE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC, so you might have to email the event organizer and see what happens, maybe they’ll let you in. Either way, doesn’t hurt to try and it might lead to your first internship/job.

Alrighty that’s all I had to say, gonna continue applying normally and go back to my struggle of finding a job, just thought I’d throw this out there for others like me who didn’t have that experience going into fairs. TRY OTHER FAIRS, they might not have the big corporations (FANG) there but you shouldn’t care if you’re trying to get your first position. 

DM me if you want to know more or if y’all want to know how to talk to recruiters though, that’s a whole other ball game that I have fun doing, you are at a huge advantage if you can talk well and hold yourself with confidence going into the talk, takes practice but gets easier over time!"

I wanted to see if there would be any interest amongst the general student population in either or both of two types of clubs/gatherings.

The first would be a support group to address climate grief. As more and more news reports come out detailing ominous signs of an impending ecological collapse (ice cap loss breaking the big records, deadly wildfire seasons every year, widespread crop failures, Amazon deforestation, ocean acidification, permafrost melt releasing massive amounts of methane triggering further warming, a recent widespread public safety power shut off in our region)  it is becoming impossible to ignore the growing emotional toll of the climate crisis. There are so many feelings associated with this crisis: fear, anger, powerlessness, hopelessness. Many people my age I speak with candidly don’t see a future in which it’s safe to have children. Many fear we could see widespread famines, water shortages, and wars in just the coming decades. Many people are already being directly affected by climate change including those who experienced the devastation of hurricane Maria and more recently Dorian, those who’ve lost homes to wildfires and floods, and countless others. Climate change is a very real, very imminent threat and there are very real anxieties, fears, and feelings around it that need to be addressed. I’d like to start a group where people can talk about and work through their grief in a community. I would base the group around the Good Grief Networks ten step program for personal resilience and empowerment in a chaotic climate: https://www.goodgriefnetwork.org. Please let me know if a group like this is something you would be interested in. 

Secondly, I noticed there aren’t any groups centered around how to live sustainably, self-sufficiently, or even many skills based groups. I’d love to start a club where we got together and learned a myriad of skills needed for a self-sustainable life. Some topics could include: canning and preserving, sewing, basic first aid, basket weaving, plant identification, archery, backcountry medicine/cooking/fire making, basic maintenance of things like bikes, cars and appliances, HAM radio, etc. Please let me know if this is something you would be interested in. 

Thank you for taking the time to read."

Friends and room-mates won't speak to my child and they've been shut out of all chat, Instagram and other communications.

While I'm not unaware that my child may not be telling me something, I'm wondering if anyone has any advice. One last thing... One of the room-mates is new, having not gotten along with their former room-mates. Does it sound likely that this room-mate may have issues that caused them to start a rumor about my child?

I guess you can call it homesickness or missing high school a little bit. I just don't like Santa Cruz vibes. It feels like High School Musical every day. It's like sunshine, and white people, and niceness. It really doesn't work with the dark and negative vibes that I'm accustomed to. My high school wasn't really in a ghetto but the school itself had enough spillover students from nearby cities that really gave it the ratchet vibes that it had. And even for the students who were local to my city, they at least didn't have that liberal college mentality.

I miss back in the day when that start of the school year meant ~3 fights per week since students were finally had the chance to get internet-tension off their chest. Everybody would run up and watch, some people would record and have their phones confiscated, somebody's weave would get snatched and thrown across the gym.

I miss going to the restrooms when I needed to pee and there were always a group of students in there doing drug deals, smoking weed (when it was illegal), and betting over games of dice on the piss-stained floors.

I miss the special occasions of bomb threats, near-miss school shootings, lockdowns, arrested teachers, and having our school on the news for some sort of scandal.

I come from a place where Filipinos say the ""Nigger/Nigga"" as if it's as vital to them as drinking water. I miss when the racism that exists was more overt. At least back then I could say ""Fuck You"" to some racist without all these people who ""don't see color"" (which isn't a virtue btw) giving me this look like I'm the one doing something wrong. And back then, people could make dark or twisted jokes without it being a crime (as long as they really are just jokes).

I hate all that peace, love, and positivity stuff. I want depression. I hatred."

I am a recent transfer student, majoring in CS. I was surprised to find out that there isn't a dedicated coding/programming club at UCSC, as there was one at my former college. I mean a club where people can just come work on code, both classwork and personal projects, find partners for projects, create hackathon teams, etc. If  I am wrong, please correct me (I know about IEEE, NBSE, etc. but these seem to be more targeted towards engineering or subgroups on campus rather than being casual places to write code.) Assuming there isn't one, I am looking to start one if the interest is there. Some questions for you guys:

1. Any idea why there isn't a club like this? Was there one in the past? I have talked to friends and people in classes who have overall expressed interest.
2. I'd like to gauge the level of interest, at least through this subreddit. Are you looking for a club like this? If so, I'd like some help with getting it started, stuff like some potential staff that would want to play a role, how we can get a dedicated room, etc. Again, I'm new on campus so this type of information would be really helpful. PM me if you think you could help!

The deadline for applications for is December 6th, so we still have some time to get the details settled."

* metros spend 10-15 minutes circling campus on their way back to the main station
* loops loop

Complaints I've heard:
* insufficient metro buses
* metro buses full of on-campus students late at night blocking out city dwellers on their way home
* buses too full on their way to campus in the mornings

Idea:
Instead of having metro buses come onto campus, install a campus-metro station at the base of campus at Bay&amp;High, and have a rain-covered loop-metro exchange station.

Benefits of this idea:
* more metro buses due to the 15 minutes removed from their round trip period
* no more on-campus students taking spaces on city buses when off-campus students are trying to get home

Deficits
* students have to get off one bus to get on another at the base of campus
* more competition for loops

I am, of course, presently in favor of this idea. I think better metro service trumps everything. Anyone see any other points missing? Does anyone know how to make this an official proposal?"

I'm a 3rd year transfer in their first semester, and I had a question. I'm looking at campus-organized Halloween events to attend around campus (since I love Halloween and, like everyone else, my brain is melty from midterms), and there are a few! There's one at my affiliated college (Kresge), but there's also a few more campus-organized events that I'm interested in attending that are at other colleges. I think it would be fine for a Kresge person like me to attend, but are there any special considerations to keep in mind beyond common sense stuff (""don't be a blatant jerk basically"")? Again, probably a non-issue, but I want to be aware of any unwritten rules on the subject. Again, these are campus events, for clarity.

The following is a repost of "" fukidontwantobealive  "" comments from a year ago. Discuss how this has changed or not has changed in the past year.

&amp;#x200B;

Going to say an unpopular opinion with a throwaway.

Because  it's just not up to par with a UC level education. You know that this  is a real issue and not just some fabricated approximation when even  faculty here admit that UCSC education is not at the same level as other  UC's. [linked here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/84qpks/ethan_miller_the_state_of_cmpe110/dvs1key/) Exceptions being UC Riverside and Merced.

Anecdotally,  a lot of people didn't know much about UCSC's reputation as ""UC Second  Choice"" when people went here. They were excited, and accepted since  this was one of the few schools that they got into. It's the UC that  people go to just because it has a UC in the name of the school, but the  similarity it has to other UC's end there.

UCSC  is poorly funded. Because of a lot of different reasons, it doesn't  receive as much funding. This resulted in not only forced increases in  freshman admission and acceptance from up on high, but also UCSC  literally can't afford to pay lecturers and undergraduate  course-teaching non-tenured faculty fair compensation for their efforts  and time spent teaching. While this is a relatively speaking shared  trend across academia in general, assistant professors and non-external  institution associated adjunct professors are treated like shit here.  And yet again, while this is a shared sentiment in academia, if someone  is stuck as an Assistant or Adjunct here, there is 0% chance of career  progression for them here and are just continually treated like shit  until they leave on their own. This might be a necessity for aggressive  selection of faculty on the part of the University. I don't know.

I  do know of several professors who just left UCSC because they were  literally not being paid enough, one of them going to teach at Yale  instead because ""they pay fair wages and compensation there.""

UCSC  is inefficient. It is one of the most bureaucratically nightmarish  schools in terms of administration and management, with a lot of  nepotism and cronyism. The way to advance in this school is to be in the  old-boys club. Nobody (refer: tenured) gives a shit about their jobs  here because they know UCSC is a career-wise dead-end university, both  for faculty and staff.

UCSC  has terrible, and I mean TERRIBLE building agreements. There are  contractual agreements with the city of Santa Cruz that makes it so UCSC  cannot develop facilities that can be visible from the city of Santa  Cruz, even if those buildings are on UCSC property.

The  result? We have absolutely ridiculous situations like the new EHS  building being built in the weirdest of locations, and UCSC is incapable  of developing further buildings unless if they develop further into  Upper Campus. Which they can't, since that is protected property. So  UCSC is eternally stuck as a campus that literally cannot expand any  further.

UCSC  is tied for being the 2nd largest UC campus, 1st being Davis. So why is  it, that UCSC even after 50 years, still has vastly inferior facilities  and buildings compared to Irvine, both founded in 1965 yet Irvine has  expenditures that is literally more than 3 times that of Santa Cruz?  Expenditures being balanced by the financial productivities of the UC's  of course.

If you go to any other  UC (exception being Riverside and Merced), you'll find that they have  vastly superior facilities, because they take contract agreements with  not only third party vendors, but also because their general limitation  is how much property that they have ownership of and their efficiency in  using said property. Literally every single other UC has some kind of  major ""chain"" of some renown brand stationed within their campuses,  which pay a huge amount of rent to the campuses and are required to give  a portion of their profits back to the campuses. UCSC doesn't do this  mostly because ""it's against Santa Cruz culture"" (not too sure about  this part, but it wouldn't surprise me if that were the case)

And finally, going to bring to to one of the more minor problems, but the students.

Students on average here are just...stupid as hell.

While  I have met a lot of smart people here, there's vastly more people who I  have no god damn clue how they even got into a UC, let alone UCSC. And  increased mean/median HS GPA for admits doesn't mean anything, that's  just a consequence of GPA inflation across Californian HS's.

I'll  admit. The only reason I went to UCSC was because it was the only  university I got into. I wasn't a very smart or motivated person in high  school, and I know deep down that I deserve to go here.

It's  a wastebasket for the UC system to throw their unwanted students into.  I'm not saying that I hate UCSC, I've begrudgingly accepted it. But  there are some serious problems with this school that can't be fixed by  students, which understandably leads to frustration. Not by any  sustainable, manageable, and realistic means, at least.

tl;dr  : UCSC is objectively a bad school. It deserves its lower ranking among  UC's for reasons that are wildly outside student's control and people  are frustrated and that's why people hate UCSC. Every morning when they  wake up they are confronted with the fact that they got into a low-tier  school just as padding for admission statistics, and they resent every  moment they are here because it just reminds them of the mediocrity and  low standards that this school is held to, and how it directly reflects  on them as a person."

I got a D in Physics and then dropped it half way through second semester, leaving an F on my transcript. I also got a D both semesters of Pre-Calculus and said fuck it. 

I still passed the two years of science required for a UC and even though I technically only passed math for two years of high school, I did finish IM3/Algebra 3 so I should be okay for my a-g requirements. 

All of this happened because my family life was falling apart and my parents were about to separate, I was outed as gay to my mom, my sister and I almost ran away, and there was a very sudden death in my life. However, I don’t quite know how to articulate this in any of my essays, but I’ll figure it out. 

The rest of my grades through high school have been okay, 65% A’s 35% B’s, and a couple C’s. I got a 3 on my AP Euro exam, another 3 for APUSH, and a 4 for AP Lang. I’m taking four APs this year and my quarter grades were fine. My weighted GPA is a 3.33 and my SAT score was a 1300. 

My extra curriculars are alright, I worked backstage in my schools theatre for two years and got up to assistant stage manager, I’m the co-president of my school’s gay-straight alliance which is super involved in our local community, I do a decent amount of community service with my local mosque and a non-profit for Syrian refugees, and I interned with my town’s City Hall this summer.

and showed science/mathematics ends in meaninglessness

1)Mathematics/science ends in contradiction:an integer=a non-integer

Mathematics ends in contradiction:6 examples

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/MATHEMATICS.pdf

2) the theory of evolution ends in meaninglessness

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/books/philosophy/Natural_selection.pdf

3) biology is not a science

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/Bbiology-is-not-a-science.pdf

3) biologists dont know what a species is-thus theory of evolution is nonsense

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/BIOLOGISTS-DON.pdf

all very simple and clear

the facts are

1) 1 is a finite number it stops

A finite decimal is one that stops, like 0.157

A non-finite decimal like 0.999... does not stop

when a finite number 1 = a non-finite number 0.999.. then maths ends in contradiction

another way

1 is an integer a whole number

0.888... is a non-integer it is not a whole number

0.999... is a non-integer not a whole number

when a integer 1 =a non-integer 0.999... maths ends in contradiction

2)1)Darwins book is called On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection ....

but

this paper shows natural selection is not the origin of new species Natural selection is not the origin of new species

Natural selection does not generate new genes/species Natural selection adds no new genetic information as it only deals with the passing on of genes/traits already present and it will be pointed out genetics cannot account for

the generation of new species/genes as it is claimed the generation of new genes [via mutation] is a random process due to radiation, viruses, chemicals etc and genetic cannot account for these process happening as they are out side the scope of genetics physics, chaos theory etc may give some explanation but genetics cant

2) Biologist cant tell us what a species is -without contradiction thus evolution theory ie evolving species is nonsense

Biologists agree there is species hybridization

but that contradicts what a species is

3) biologist tell us they investigate life

but

they cant tell us what life is-they can tell us what life does but cant tell us what life is they cant even give a definition of life that is not nonsense"

* but she keeps saying ""bio woman"" unnecessarily to refer to cis women?

Like... why not just say... women... why would it possibly be necessary to specify cis women... trans women also face misogyny at school/work...
* a TA (can't verify if more than one) gave a presentation in section that used the term ""transsexual"" *multiple times* throughout; [here's a pic](https://imgur.com/a/jSPhlxN) but also the TA just kept saying ""transsexual"" to refer to trans people and the reading didn't even have that term in it so why???

So here we go:

Benefiting from white privilege doesn't mean that you have not/will not face oppression in other ways. Like oppression, privilege intersects with a variety of aspects of who you are because (**shocker**) we're all multidimensional people with diverse experiences!!! What someone means when they say you ""benefit from white privilege"" is that you won't face systemic oppression for being white. Systemic oppression is not just about race. Like I said before, you can still face oppression based on your economic status, sexuality, gender, etc.

A lot of white UCSC students have been getting upset recently at the idea that white privilege cancels out other forms of oppression. Being white does not mean you have not faced hardships, it just means that the color of your skin has not played a systemic role in your struggles. **ANYWAY,** prepare for these conversations. Everyone has some form of privilege. Being able to gain a post-secondary education in itself is a privilege. So please, spend less time arguing and try having valuable discourse."

I’m kinda thinking about doing a senior thesis (which is 2 quarters and 50 pages of writing vs a 1 quarter senior seminar and 15 pages of writing). I’m good at writing, I have a decent idea for a thesis (I think), and I know a professor who would probably be down to advise me. But what is the day-to-day of being enrolled in a thesis class like? Are there lectures and tests and stuff or is it literally just researching and writing? Is there even a physical lecture? My course-load for these next two quarters would be the thesis class, one major requirement, a language class, and one bullshit class. 

So yeah, if there’s any recent alumni reading here who did a senior thesis in a humanities department, any advice or info?"

I’m currently a freshman looking into clubs I should join next year and stumbled upon the college republicans. I grew with my moms side being Democrats and my dads side being republicans so I’ve always enjoyed hearing both side’s perspectives. 


So when I came across the college republicans, I did some research and legitimately cannot tell if this is a troll group or some sort of satire or something else? I came across their [website](https://ucscgop.weebly.com/) and their logo is Pepe the frog. Now I’m as much of a fan of dat boi as the next person but this doesn’t seem appropriate within the context of a serious group focused on political discourse. 

I also searches UCSC Facebook page and found numerous accounts of the college republicans trolling people? It seems like a lot of  what comes out of the group is controversial, edgy hot takes on obvious liberal views. Is this group’s purpose just to “trigger” liberals? 


Finally I found this [video](https://youtu.be/M8yjVFZXJxo) where the club invited a famous conservative writer, David Horowitz, for a talk. That’s awesome! I’m grateful an established figure is willing to come to UCSC and give a talk but something felt really off about this video. It felt like less of a discussion and more of like a “bash the left and applause”. The whole thing just felt like a right wing circle jerk if I’m being blunt. 

Sorry this is such a long post but I’m genuinely confused on what to make of this group. If this is a legitimate group, why do they act in this manner? Regardless, free speech is a thing so they have every right to say or do whatever they want (in reason) but it’s just hard to take it serious. Idk ultimately I just want to know if this is a club worth joining or not. Sorry for the wall of text.Thanks."

Well... easy fix right? Just contact the IT services and get a password list: I tried but it seems they're closed on the weekends and I need the login by this Sunday. 

How about going on the website and getting an MFA token? If I want to submit a ticket for help or even get a token you need the MFA authentication which I don't have. Just a full circle.

I try to make other friends but everyone else is so anti social they push others away, especially in merrill where everyone just stays in the dorms and dont even say hello.

its getting so bad I may have to switch from a BS to a BA just so I can leave sooner and go back home where I belong.

I'm in my major due to the wide variety of post-grad options leading to reliable jobs, but I've been learning more about psych and have found several positions that are both reliable and would actually let me help people.

I really want to take some UX/UI type classes (I took TIM 158 spring quarter and we did some prototyping and low key I had fun with that stuff). I heard CMPM 131 would be a good one to take, but it's not listed on the class search even though it's on the course catalogue for winter 2020 :(

I'm a MCD Biology major and transferred from a CC having already taken the equivalent of physics 6A - however it was almost a year ago and the concepts are really rusty. It's also been a half a year on top of that since I took the calculus series. I have time to fit a physics 6A retake into my schedule, but was wondering if it would be necessary to take 6A again to do well in 6B? 

Do the concepts in 6B build upon 6A content or is it general concepts I could review without retaking the course? I don't really want to pay for it again, but I definitely don't want to fail 6B if I'm lacking foundational info.

I already failed ONE of my major courses two years ago before declaring because I was stressing out about cops investigating my roommate which lasted for a few weeks leading up to finals. Anyways, I passed that course the next quarter.

So yeah, I only failed one major req, but I can't study in these conditions. I want to take a **PASS/NO PASS** on another major req after delcaring last year.

Our goal is to provide more events to give people an out let to let loose and have fun as well as give locals a platform to showcase their music in front of their friends. 

Our first show is FREE with RSVP. We're throwing a Welcome Back Party to kick off the 2020 new year. Come support this new movement and local talent! We are creating something new in SC. If you'd like to get involved, get experience/ grow your network in music and events, we're looking for DJs that can do promo and to build our promo team! HMU for questions!"

I'm a junior currently enrolled in cse111 and cmpm80k for winter2020. I need both 80v and 80k to get the other two classes I have to take in spring, but cse111 was filling up really quickly so I jumped in it during first pass and left film80v for second pass since it had 200 seats open. My first enrollment ends tonight at midnight and my second pass is Friday 10am. Right now film80v has 76 seats left, 30 less than it had last night. What are the chances of it still having openings Friday morning? Should I risk it, or should I swap cse111 for film80v now and just resign to taking cse111 in the spring?

I know I should focus on guaranteeing the classes that are absolutely required, but if I don't take cse111 next quarter then winter2020 I'm going to have 3 lower division courses with no cs, and spring2020 I'd have 3 upper division fairly time consuming classes.

The class itself teaches a lot about API fundamentals and a lot of interviews ask you to use an API and do something with requests you make to it. I for one had never worked with APIs because I've had no technical background prior to college and I never had a personal project, so it took me the longest time to understand what it is in the first place. This class teaches you a lot of practical skills beyond just the concepts. If you are scared of whether or not you should take this class, don't think twice. It's hard but it's VERY rewarding. It's one of the best classes to take to help you get a job imo (I'm not being a teacher's pet for peter alvaro. I barely spoke to the guy when I took it). I just wanted to say how valuable the things you learn in this class are and I gotta say, I would be a lot more clueless at my entry level job if I didn't take this course.

I met with a peer advisor, who was lovely, but couldn’t sign-off on it and could only forward it for processing to the actual advisor. She said my Education declaration could take up to two weeks.

Now I don’t want to go all entitled customer here. I understand that people are busy, departments get backlogged, welcome to college. But I can’t wrap my head around the discrepancy. The declaration paperwork only requires a look-over for correctness, a signature, and what seems to be a few strokes of the keyboard, at least from the looks of it. Why can I meet with the advisor in charge in one department and they can instantly declare me, but I can only meet with a student in the other department, and won’t be declared for up to two weeks? Is Education just a much larger major with more students? Is the declaration processing more complicated for Education on MyUCSC? Is their department advisor just super busy compared to the Sociology advisor?

Basically, I think being an RA for 2-3 years is a little bit selfish and probably shouldn’t be allowed. I mean, maybe if the RA hiring process was more anonymous my feelings would be different, but the way it’s set up now, it’s super easy to just hire your friends and re-hire each other. Year after year of this means that less and less people have a legitimate chance at being recognized for having good RA’ing skills. Like, okay, maybe it’s reasonable for people to RA for two years, maybe they’re really passionate about that themed hall or maybe they’re crazy fucking good at it. I get that. But don’t you think three years is kinda pushing it? Like you get three years of free housing just because your friend lowkey tag-teamed you in? 

I’m not trying to say that being an RA is easy, I’m sure it’s really stressful and taxing and justifiably worth the free housing compensation. But three years just seems to be pushing it a little....especially in a city with this bad of a housing crisis.

Students develop components of applications, leading to fully functional applications by the end of the course.

I've been seeing a lot of especially bad struggling going on this quarter, so I'm writing this post in hopes that it can help someone. I know how scary it is to seek help, especially when you don't know what to expect, so here I'm going to write everything I've learned about the CAPS and DRC process in the two and a half years I've worked with them.

**Notes:** This is the information I can give as a UC Ship student, I don't know the details for non UC Ship students, but if you walk in they will 100% tell you what they can do for you. If the thing you're struggling with is ADHD, CAPS is very limited in the help they can provide. I believe they require a full examination to diagnose an attention disorder, and even then they don't have ADHD medicine readily available in the campus pharmacy. I'm not entirely sure, though.

*The CAPS center is across the street of 9/10, upstairs and the OPPOSITE side of where the stairs lead you (right above the pharmacy). The DRC building is located in the Hahn Student Services building, which is across a bridge from the McHenry library.* 

&amp;#x200B;

**CAPS Therapy:**

You can choose to either schedule an appointment over the phone or walk in and fill in a form for them to process you into an appointment. If you feel you're in need of immediate care, you should walk in and express this. You can be connected to a crisis therapist, who will make sure you're okay and not in danger of hurting yourself. 

When you walk in, you can take two different routes as you fill out the check in form. If you check off that you have been feeling suicidal, they will find a therapist for you immediately to make sure you're going to be okay and safe. I will strongly advise that **IF** you want to check off feeling suicidal that you check off that you do NOT have a plan on suicide if you don't want to risk getting a 5450\*\* form filed on you. It might take up to 15 minutes tops for them to find you an available therapist, depending on how busy they are. You'll almost be guaranteed a same day check in though. If you do not check off either of the two suicide boxes, they will feel you aren't in any immediate danger or in danger of hurting others and will probably schedule you for a different day appointment.

When you talk to the therapist, you just have to make sure they understand that you are not a danger to yourself. If you mention you feel depressed and unmotivated, that's enough for them to give you the help you deserve. You don't have to mention you are suicidal. If you mention you have vague suicidal ideation but that you would never follow through, it's very unlikely that they will involuntarily hospitalize you. If they think you need it, they'll give you a short term therapist to help you through the next one to threeish months probably. However they do not offer on campus long term therapy. If you want a long term therapist, they will give you a referral and you'll meet with a therapist off campus. I hear that there is a place near the Metro Center, so it'll just be a short bus ride and a small walk.

\*\***What is a 5450?** A 5450 form gets filled out by a doctor if they feel you are a danger to your own safety. It's what leads to involuntary hospitalization. Generally you don't want it to get to this. It takes away some of your legal rights for up to (but not always) three days, and you are put under the care of a hospital that will monitor your condition. If it comes to this, you'll be okay, and you'll be safe. Just stay calm, and remember that the people handling you want the best for you. They're on your side. I've been to the local psychiatric hospital, and the staff are so very supportive and sweet. Trust them, because they're there for the sole purpose of helping you. 

&amp;#x200B;

**CAPS Medication/Psychiatric Services:**

If you express you want medication, they will assign you to a long term psychiatrist. You'll talk about your needs and they'll start you off with a SMALL dose of a medication, where you can pick up downstairs at the pharmacy. They might tell you to get your blood drawn sometime soon downstairs to make sure you're good to take medication. They'll continue meeting with you every one to two weeks so they can monitor your side effects, health, and needs. Most likely you'll jump from prescription to prescription until you find one that suits you. They might raise or decrease the dosage. They might put you on more than one to find the perfect dose for you. **Keep in mind that all of these changes are 100% YOUR CHOICE**. They will NEVER force you or pressure you to take medication. They're only there to advise you on what they think is best. You will be in control. 

The process might be a struggle, but try not to lose hope. Medication isn't for everyone, but even when it is it takes a while to get it right. Try your best to be completely honest. Feeling 10% better? Don't tell them you're good, admit that things are better but that you aren't completely happy, and they'll talk with you about if they think you should keep trying to find a better dose. It's also normal for medications to lose effectiveness after a while. Don't be discouraged. It's all part of the process. After over two years of medications, I kept making little improvements, but I only found what I think is the perfect prescription 5ish months ago. It was a long journey getting to this point, but I'm the happiest I've been in actual years. If you're feeling good about your prescription, they'll change the appointments to every month, and if you feel great and ask them, they might make it every other month etc. If you ever develop side effects and your appointment isn't until next week or month or something, they'll always be available through the Health e-Messenger.

&amp;#x200B;

**Vacation Coverage:**

Your UC ship coverage lasts through the summer even if you aren't taking summer classes, so you don't have to worry about getting cut off for summer. They'll give you referrals to meet with people in your area over the summer, and give you the medication you need. If you can't find one close to you, they'll even go as far as to pull it up and help you find someone you can meet with. You'll also be able to access them through the e-Messenger.

&amp;#x200B;

**DRC Accommodations:**

You know those little blurbs at the bottom of every syllabus talking about disability resources? It's not exclusive to physical or severe mental disabilities. It applies to anything academically debilitating, including depression and anxiety. You can make an appointment and they'll go over what accommodations they offer. If you have a note from a therapist it'll be much easier to get approved, but I think they also give accommodations without it. I'm not entirely sure. If you get approved, a new menu option on your student portal will be added for Disability Services where you can check off boxes for the classes you need letters for. Go ham and check them all off, whether you think you'll need them or not. It's a safety net. The Accommodation Letters will be emailed to your ucsc email after a few days. 

Being a DRC student is a godsend. Seriously. They offer things like absence and tardiness excuses, deadline extensions, and laptop approval during lectures. The effectiveness of these letters is up to the professor, so don't abuse them. Still, they'll usually be VERY understanding and will work with you a lot more leniently to help you pass. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Emotional Support Animal (ESA) on campus:**

I'm hesitant to cover this, because I don't want people to glamorize the idea of having a pet on campus. It's not some fun cutesy college experience aesthetic bullshit- do NOT try and get an ESA unless you truly believe it will help you get you through your depression. Pets are not accessories, they are not feel-good tools either. They have needs, and if you're having trouble taking care of yourself, you need to think long and hard about whether you're prepared for the commitment of taking care of a whole other living being. 

**Questions you should ask yourself before deciding whether you should apply for an ESA:** Are you capable financially and physically of caring for this animal? You should have a solid few hundred dollars saved away AFTER buying all the basic care materials, in case of a veterinary emergency. You have to be capable of remembering to feed and groom and pick up after your animal every single day. Will you be available emotionally for your animal as they are for you? An ESA does not solely exist to comfort you. They are living being creatures too, and need love and affection and constant care. If you'll be gone all day sometimes and you live alone, consider the emotional well being of the animal, who will feel abandoned and alone. Will you be able to take care of this animal for potentially the next 10 years? This isn't a fish, they'll be alive for a while, and they'll bond with you. Have a solid plan for how you'll have your ESA with you after graduation.

**Still want an ESA?** The ESA application can be picked up at the DRC. If you have a note from a therapist, it'll be much easier to get approved. The approval process will take a few weeks, and then you'll schedule a meeting with your housing coordinator to go over the rules. When you get your ESA, you'll meet with them again to give them your pet's health records.

**Getting an ESA:** You can bring a pet you already own at home, or adopt one if you feel ready for the commitment. If you're struggling a lot with the common symptoms of depression (fatigue, lack of self care, inability to go outside) and you really want an ESA, please get a cat. A dog needs a lot of extra care, and for you to give them the best quality of life, you'll need to be able to walk them every single day for a good amount of time. For where to get the animal, the first main options I considered were Craigslist and the Santa Cruz Shelter. However, Craigslist results will mostly be in neighboring cities, so be ready for a drive to meet and pick them up. For the local shelter, you need to be over 21 to adopt. Soooo I personally had to fall back on Petsmart's in store shelter, where I met my best buddy Bailey. Also be aware when adopting, that you are responsible for any damage or disturbance your pet causes. A loud or destructive animal is definitely not a good candidate.

Be aware that there is usually a 100-150$ adoption fee, on top of needing to buy a brush, scratching post/litterbox for cats, toys for dogs, and pet food and potentially litter regularly. Be prepared to spend 200$ straight away. Then also be ready to pay the monthly fees for care. I personally have to spend \~40$ every month for litter and cat food. 

*When you adopt this animal, you are adopting a new friend and family member, so don't fuck around and be a good owner for your good boye/gorle.*

**ESA Housing Rights:** An ESA is actually protected by California law in terms of housing. Any apartment, including ones that have a no pet policy, cannot turn you away or charge you more for having an ESA. If you provide proper documentation, they must allow you to keep your animal with you as long as they do not damage the property or cause a disturbance of any kind. However, this is in terms of housing only. ESA's are *not* Service Animals. Service Animals are trained and are allowed basically anywhere, but your ESA is basically just another pet in every other aspect. Hopefully though, this housing protection will help you stay with your animal after graduation.

*If you abandon your ESA after the school year ends, I will send PG&amp;E after you.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Don't be afraid to get the help you need!**

If you're depressed or struggling, you deserve to get the help you need. Don't ever feel like what you're going through isn't real or important enough to be addressed. It might help and it might not, but don't ever forget that there is help and support available for you. DMs are always open."

So I just ignored the messages because I didn’t want anti-virus software. 

Now they’ve suspended my internet access. Okay, fine. You win. I tried to game the system but it didn’t work. I’ll get your stupid anti-virus protection. So I try to click on the links to free software suggested. 

Here’s the real kicker: now that I no longer have internet I can’t actually access those links. Whenever I click one, Google Chrome stops me because the link is apparently unprotected. I imagine that’s either the fault of the internet suspension or ResNet not giving me good links in the first place. So now I’m kind of stuck in this loop where I don’t have internet because my computer doesn’t comply, but I can’t fix the compliance issues because I don’t have internet. 

It’s not the end of the world just yet. I have a couple ideas as to obtaining this software in other methods, and I’ll contact ResNet if none of them work. But I guess lesson of the day: don’t do what I did?? Also ResNet idk if you’ll see this but maybe please consider universal access to anti-virus websites regardless of compliance? Wish me luck (low-key expecting these programs to just not work on Mac OS)

tl;dr suspended from internet because computer doesn’t comply, but in order to fix the compliance issues I need internet access"

It was a $10 water bottle and I could just buy another one, but this water bottle has sentimental meaning to me and I would really just like to get it back."

e1nvua,Has anyone else gotten these weird SETS questions?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/e1nvua/has_anyone_else_gotten_these_weird_sets_questions/,throwawaySlugBug,1,2019-11-25 14:21:56,8,/r/UCSC/comments/e1nvua/has_anyone_else_gotten_these_weird_sets_questions/,NaN,"I was wondering if anyone else has had the same experience I had with one of their SETS surveys. After a while of doing my surveys, I got to my favorite professor, who I wanted to leave a good review for. My browser stopped responding for a few seconds once I clicked the link, until a question showed up at the top left corner of the page. I thought that the CSS hadn't loaded or something, so I reloaded the survey, which did nothing. The question itself was pretty weird: *""What is your current desire to lock your window?""*

There were a list of check-circles ranging from 1-10. At first I thought it was a late Halloween prank from our professor or something. I answered ""2"" (I live on the 5th floor of the dorms) and moved on to the next question, which took a while to scroll down since they seemed to be separated by absurdly large amounts of white space. Anyway, the next question went like this, with a box for answers underneath: *""What is the sharpest object in your room?""*

I thought that the school had accidentally switched the survey with some kind of hunting quiz or something, so i kept scrolling down to collect potential hints on what caused the bug. As I scrolled down, a black gradient started to appear on the survey. I saved a few of the questions that really caught my attention, I guess so that the admins could figure out where the questions were coming from:

*""If you were unknowingly ingesting large quantities of Aspirin for a week and suddenly stopped, would you notice any symptoms?*

*""If you were to fall from the Science Hill bridge, what sound would you make upon hitting the bottom?""*

I didn't think any survey would ask things this weird. The further I scrolled down the page, the more black it got, to the point where I had to highlight the text to make out what it was saying. The questions got more and more bizarre and hypothetical:

*""You are in bed, watching coverage of a fire in your city. You realize that the building on fire is actually your apartment complex. The news crew notices a man still in the building, in what appears to be your apartment. Upon zooming in, they reveal an exact copy of yourself, standing completely still in your living room. You hear a low murmuring from outside your bedroom door. What do you do?""*

*""You are at a theme park riding a roller coaster with your friends, when the ride enters a tunnel. After a few seconds in  pitch black, you think that the coaster should have exited the tunnel by then. After a bit longer, you reach to your right and feel nothing where your friend should be. The screams surrounding you are getting louder. Do you live like this forever or try unbuckling your seat belt?""*

*""You awake in a state of sleep paralysis to see a dark figure standing in your closet. After seven seconds, your motion sensor light turns on to reveal Professor (...) standing motionless in your closet. You realize that you are awake and still unable to move.""*

That last one wasn't even a question. The (...) was the actual last name of the professor I was doing the survey for, which I won't reveal in case this is some weird bug. I'm at the point on the site where the entire page is pitch black. The questions have lost all meaning, most of them not even resembling sentences. There was one warning me to lock my window, another telling me not to talk to my RA.

I hadn't even noticed until now, but it's completely dark outside my room at 3PM. I can usually see the forest at night, but it's pitch black, like someone rolled a cover over my window. The branch that's always scratching my window keeps getting louder, but I think it's just my imagination. Anyway, I hope this info helps the admins figure out what's going on and fix the bug. I personally think it's a memory leak."

I wanted to take a gap year but couldn’t because of my financial aid. People tell me I need to just give it time and I’ll adjust, but this feels different. I thought if I took a quarter off I would maybe be able to reset and figure things out and I would have some time to work full time and save up some money as well. On the other hand I don’t really know if it’s the right choice for me to do this because I do love SC and the people there. Does anyone have experience with taking an LOA that can give some advice? 

Also what would happen to my spot in the dorms if I did take the LOA. Would it stay empty till I came back or would it be filled?"

Also I was at Bowls today right before they closed and the lady working gave me like 5 free pastries because they we’re gonna go stale while being closed for thanksgiving and she “didn’t want the temptation of eating them right before thanksgiving”.

Personally, I have no help from my parents, but I do have goo enough financial aid + private loans that I don’t have to pay anything out of pocket for tuition during the year. My freshman year I had to pay $400/mo out of pocket (rest was covered by fin aid) for my dorm though, but it was too stressful so last year and this year (I have 3rd year EOP housing) I got a private loan for it. I work about 20-25 hours a week and make about $750 a month. I don’t have a meal plan and literally so much of my fucking money goes towards food. Like I don’t pay rent, my only bill is $150 towards my loans every month, and I’m still only able to put like $100/mo in savings.   I don’t even shop for clothes or anything, idk where my fucking money goesssss.

They are very pretty male kitties of about ten years of age, and they both love my mom. Only one of them is willing to deal with strangers (I believe they both accept new people, but it would take a while).  They once looked like tabby-point siamese, but now they look more like silver tabbies. They are exceedingly soft, and Catman, the one I can pet, is a loving purr-monster. The one I can't pet is Tigger, and he is just generally scared of everyone but my mom.

The cats are used to having kibble or Fancy Feast and coming and going as they please through a cat door in my mom's bedroom. They are altered males who have up-to-date shots.They are very dedicated hunters, so please don't take them if you would let them outside and then be distressed when they brought you gopher entrails or bird feathers.

I can't take the cats, because my own, highly beloved, cat would probably kill them (he is combative and weighs more than both of them put together). My sister could bring them up to Santa Cruz sometime in the next two weeks.

Here is [one of them](https://imgur.com/a/qfgBF6B). They look enough alike that I can't tell them apart, but my mom can.  I would rather not give you only one of them, for they have lived their entire lives together. Please don't take them if you live on campus.

The only problem is, if I'm enrolled, I don't know whether I should replace it with CSE 16 or with ARTG 80H.

Logically, I know I should take CSE 16 earlier, but as someone who finds math very time consuming and difficult, CSE 16 + CSE 30 + Psych 20 feels a bit heavy. CSE 30 + Psych 20 + ARTG 80H feels very doable, though it would push back my requirements slightly.

This month, I had to put up with forcing to move bricks to keep my room, so I don't get evicted.

She got so drunk one time that she started painted my room during midterms. She got paint all over my bed.

Two weeks ago, she invited a homeless person to our home to stay who threaten to poison our food.

I got caught up in the storm and kinda made a sort of bad decision...  
My class required us to write an essay following a prompt that requires us to follow a thought process of an author with in an essay they wrote. So usually my process of writing is basically using what i know from the essay and also what i understood from the lecture and then i put that all together. so I was checking my work to see if there are any parts that i plagiarized by accident like small phrases that i couldn't have said any different. I had the quotes i pulled annotated and cited with a bibliography but... i just got an email saying that there has been a incident of plagiarism and cheating i havent been named specifically it was an email addressed ""Dear, all""...  
im not going to lie but i did use the internet and online discussion forums as ideas of what my thought process is supposed to look like aaaaand i ended up finding a tool that takes a essay and pulls key sentences... i used that in the end... how screwed am i?"

No, I have not been accused of plagiarism, but I have this one professor who is super super strict about it. He has me so paranoid about this paper that I’m citing almost every single sentence and idek how to do an analysis anymore without citing it because /I got the information from somewhere, right?/ 

Anyway, so theoretically, let’s say you turned in a paper that you honestly didn’t cheat on, and everything’s cited, but somehow you forgot to cite one or two sentences, or you didn’t realize they needed to be cited. If the teacher reported you for this, how serious would the school take it? Like obviously you’re not trying to plagiarize if every thing else is cited, right? Or if it’s an honest mistake? I’d be especially interested to hear from people who were accused of plagiarism and successfully fought it! 

(Also I find it pretty annoying how inconsistently this school enforces plagiarism, I’ve had some teachers not care if things are even cited at all, and then teachers like this in literally the same department who act like you’ll be sniped if you make a single mistake.)"

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my questions:

1. How much of a disadvantage is not knowing C/Python? Ive taken C++ I and II so Im decent at a lot of the basics of programming like arrays, loops, templates, pointers, etc, and I'll be taking Intro Data Structures and Discrete Math in the spring. Can I take a remedial course to learn syntax?
2. My assignments have all been through zybooks or canvas, but Ive heard you guys do things differently here. How are assignments generally submitted and how can I learn/practice before school starts?
3. Does the tool you use to write code make a real difference (IDE vs Text Editor), and is one preferred by professors? My current school encourages us to use visual studio, so thats what I'm familiar with. 
4. This one isn't directly CS related, but how is the student disability office? My current accommodations have saved me from having to drop out, so I was wondering, if I get in, how and when would I go about contacting the school to get them put in place prior to the school year starting? And is it hard getting priority registration through them? My current school automatically gives all students registered with the disability center priority enrollment, and its been a lifesaver as my cc classes have been hard to get. I know CS is super impacted, so would that be a viable way to get around that?

&amp;#x200B;

So sorry thats a ton, and I should be studying for finals right now, really appreciate any input :)"

I see the spiral mechanism turning and my anticipation grows. The first bag gets dislodged and falls to its inevitable consumption. My eyes glow with excitement, my mouth watering at the thought of tasting them perfectly nacho blasted tortilla chips. Sadly, it gets stuck on top of the tray, with the second bag ending up in the same predicament as the first, stuck on the spiral mechanism.

I think it's too late for me to turn back at this point without tacking on too much more time before I can graduate but I'm also afraid that I'll regret not doing what I want in the future. I just don't really know what to do at this point.

I know that it's probably just an issue of the grass seeming greener on the other side and that switching what I'm doing might not even be possible or what I think it would be.

Looking at the Portal, I see Cal Grant A is gone, and it's all replaced by a UC Santa Cruz Grant.

Any ideas on what to do? Or will I just have to wait till Monday? On the charges it says $700, Main Page $5000, and with Winter $10,000.

Can't add or change classes and I feel as if there's an error or i'm completely screwed over.

Is there a change they changed or removed Cal Grant A without telling me or something?

Still though, I don't know how they can reverse charges and take back grant money and charge me more even though It was all paid in full months ago."

But I just have some thoughts and questions and if anyone here is more informed I would love to hear your input, and I’m sure other students would to. 

My problem is that I can see the UC holding out on this for a very, very long time. Think about the AFSCME strikes.....they’re ineffective because the UC doesn’t give a fuck. When the campus is essentially shut down, the school looses no money. We still have to pay tuition for those days. So how does that affect the UC execs in the slightest? Obviously it doesn’t, because they’ve been protesting for the basically same things for years, and the UC has been holding out. Evidently the UC literally couldn’t care less. 

And I sense the same thing will happen with the wildcat strike. The UC gives literally no shits about if students receive their grades. They still get the money of us being here. Well, until some people’s scholarships (and financial aid?) get withheld, but that’s not exactly  a substantial enough amount of money to break the bank. I fear that this strike will go on for years, as the AFSCME strike has been, and students won’t be able to apply for grad schools because they’ll have missing grades. And this will be catastrophic for poor student relying on scholarships. 

It’s not a matter of adopting the UC talking points......these are real concerns. And I know the grad students aren’t aiming to hurt us, and I support the theory of their strike, but the logistics just seem off. The UC doesn’t give a fuck, and they’re not going to mobilize enough people in the next 5 days (or ever, like with AFSCME) to make a difference. 

And just on a personal note, undergrad students are the poorest on campus, and it’s hard to sympathize with people complaining about $2100/mo not being enough money. Like the breakdown is that they spend $600/mo on groceries....are you serious? Many undergrads live on $500-800 a month with a part time job. How can the grad students expect us to sympathize/mobilize with them when they’re complaining about making triple the amount that most of us do? And once again, I’m 100% pro paying less money to the admin who do nothing compared to the grad students who keep the school running. But logistically i just can’t see the rational when undergrads don’t sympathize with the movement at all. 

Anyway, I’d love to hear input about this. Part of this is venting my own frustrations and part of it is me just trying to hear what others think. I love the theory of strikes but I feel like the way they’re implemented at this school is useless. The undergrads end up suffering, not the UC execs. And I know that isn’t the goal or fault of the unions but it seems pretty vital....how can you expect to mobilize people who you piss off?"

  I am mostly a lurker on this subreddit but I got the email about the COLA strike going on and I decided to post because it affects me since all my grades are changing on Canvas. I am not against grad students striking to get better wages, however, I was wondering what would happen if the school decided to disagree with the demands. Would we get an incomplete on our transcript? That costs us $10 per class to get changed in the future. I don't think it is fair to be forced to pay $10 to get a grade change especially if that was not the grade we would have originally received in the class if the strike wasn't occurring. I just want to know what will happen in the aftermath in the event that the school doesn't agree to the demands because that affects our transcripts.

Thanks for reading."

What is the plan for this? The same as the countless other \*\*\*failed\*\*\* strikes? That the undergrads will feel \*so\* moved by the strikers' actions to hurt them that they will support them? That's just plain bullshit. This strategy has never worked and it will never work. In fact, this particular strike is possibly the worst out of the bunch I've seen at this school so far, as it has the possibility of getting undergrads \*\*\*kicked out of the school\*\*\* because their financial aid, and therefore their attendance at UCSC, are dependent on their grades.

I can't understand why every time something like this happens at UCSC, people always look at this strategy that has never worked and think ""Maybe it will this time!"" It won't. Just block entry to the admin buildings or something. Simply doing something along those lines while building awareness around campus will be much more effective both directly, and in getting students to join in. And if there's some worry that ""But it might get me fired/have negative consequences!"" \*\*THAT'S THE FUCKING POINT OF STRIKES.\*\* Grow a pair and do the protest yourself. Just doing that will give you more sympathy than \*hurting the people you want to help you.\*

As it stands, every time these strikes happen the administration just sits and laughs as nothing happens to them, while the students get fucked over. This is not how you get things to change."

On Sunday, December 8 a few hundred UCSC graduate student workers got together and overwhelmingly voted to engage in a wildcat grading strike. UCSC administration refuses to pay us enough to live in Santa Cruz. We are sure you can relate—rents here are too damn high. As we see it, the UC is screwing graduate workers and undergraduate students over. For us, poverty wages. For you, massive debt and cuts to services. The outcome is a bad situation for us both. 

We’re asking the UC to give us a cost of living adjustment (COLA). You can learn more about COLA here: [https://payusmoreucsc.com](https://payusmoreucsc.com/)

We’ll field questions about grades, our work, the UC and more. Remember this for when you graduate: your employer is most likely going to try to screw you if you don’t fight back!!

I want to acknowledge that as stated previously the university is going to do its best to drive a wedge between the undergraduate and graduate students, and we should not let them do that. 

YOUR FINANCIAL AID AND SCHOLARSHIPS WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY THIS STRIKE. 

The graduate students have done the research to ensure they would not be harming any undergraduate students. They are still going to administer and grade your finals, but will hold the grades until the demands are met. If you have a special case for your outside scholarship, send an email to your TA and inform of the situation. They want things to be better for the sake of ALL of us. 

Instead of making a ton of angry rants about how this will affect you, contact your TA’s and ask them about the situation and how you can help. Direct your anger towards putting pressure on the administration of the UC system. If you’re upset about this because of your financial aid I understand because without financial aid, I would not be able to attend any university. If you’re upset about not being granted the “service you’re paying for” then contact the people in charge and tell them how upset you are and how they need to do something about it (meet the demands).

Support the strike if you can--it will not impact undergraduate grades negatively--your transcript simply won't be updated w/ fall quarter grades until an agreement is reached. Exceptions will gladly be made for students who need fall grades for grad school applications, study abroad apps, scholarships., etc. All finals will proceed and be fully graded as normal, the grades simply won't be released if there is no agreement met this week. Striking during finals week isn't easy for your TAs either--most grad students have final research papers and projects due this week as well--but the grading strike is the only way grad student labor will likely be taken seriously by the administration. The GSA responded to a fairly threatening email from admin tonight and expressed their  willingness to meet with admin as soon as possible to find a solution, so please support the grad student population--many of your professors likely already do.

To: Chancellor Larive, iCP/EVC Kletzer   

We, the undersigned faculty, recognize that UCSC’s graduate students are a vital part of the campus’s ability to teach, learn, conduct research, and serve the public. The faculty would not be able to carry out our jobs without them. But their monthly wages—like the wages of the staff—are not adequate to live in Santa Cruz; they are severely “rent-burdened,” which leads to a cascade of other issues such as housing and food insecurity. The situation is untenable. We ask the administration to address the high cost of living in Santa Cruz for graduate students, allowing them to pursue their studies and to carry out their jobs.

Several of my friends and colleagues in SOE have indicated they are not either. Here's a compiled list of some reasons why we are hesitant.

1. **Demands are too extreme.** Yes, I am well aware that rent is insane. I've been here a while and have had to move every year due to skyrocketing prices. However, $1412/month, for *every* graduate student, *regardless* of employment? I'm sorry, but that's just insane.
2. **We seem to be getting by.** After subtracting my rent and utilities (~$1300) and remaining student fees (~$300) from the stipend I receive, there's still ~$400 left over for the month. That's not a lot, and I would love to put more of it into savings. I don't own a car (and at this rate, it will be a long time before I ever can), and have few other expenses. The only thing my parents pay for me is my line on their phone plan and my health insurance (I've been on their plan since I was born, much cheaper than UCSHIP).
3. **And even if we are having trouble, the future looks bright.** As engineers, our prospective salaries are quite luxurious. So even if we do have to borrow now, we'll more than make up for it during our careers. 
4. **Not enough faculty support in our department.** Looking at [the list of faculty](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GYoJ_cxm-5ycLmEOaPxmAYgft57-wbsgL__GiJQvClA/edit), only 12 faculty with ""engineering"" in their title have indicated support. And the names that are listed are the usual suspects when it comes to this kind of action; the names of those with more clout are conspicuously absent. I am almost certain that me striking now would result in my TA appointments for next quarter being revoked or future quarters simply not happening. There are, after all, plenty of grad students in SOE who can and would want to TA. I'm also not well-liked enough to be irreplaceable.
5. **It just won't succeed.** Let's assume that we have somehow convinced UCSC admin to give us this (or even a lesser) COLA. Because the funds for this kind of thing are allocated at a UC-level, our next person to convince is UCOP and our dark overlord Janet and her gang of regents. That's not exactly a friendly, receptive group. 

I am posting with a throwaway since I do not want to give admin the satisfaction of holding me up as a poster child for their side, nor the organizers to drag my name through the dirt as they already have to someone else in that infamous email chain.

To be sure, I respect the movement. Everyone could use some extra cash. The administrative apparatus has spiraled out of control and needs to be heavily trimmed down. But this isn't the right way to do it."

It would actually jeopardize my college career.

No one really seems to know what's actually going to happen or what the ramifications of this will be for undergraduates.

Put those mental breakdowns and sleepless nights aside as it really does get better. This for the few of you who had a shit quarter or going through yet another shit quarter. 
I started off here with 0.5 gpa. How? Bc I’m stupid and have bad luck, but really just stupid. Next quarter I actually started passing and bumped that baby up to 1.5. The quarter after that I dun goofed and inched up to 1.83 and almost got expelled. The quarter after that 2.33, followed by 2.55, 2.83, 2.93, and presently just crossed 3.0. 
If you made it this far and wondering why am telling you this silly story, it’s because I had no one to tell me when I was losing my goddamn mind to calm down and just reassess for a sec. I had no one to help me out, I never told my friends bc I was too embarrassed, my family had no clue I was gonna get kicked out, I had many breakdowns, and every advisor and admin in this school assumed I was gonna fail out. 
I played myself hard and then I unplayed myself. I had no one and yet, just this morning, I got accepted into one of the most competitive capstone courses in my major. In the real world this probably means nothing but this is the world I’m in rn and it means everything. 
So if you’re having a bad quarter, or still going through it, just take a shower, go to your finals, eat, take the L and enjoy your break.

Things like how this whole strike would be over so much faster if EVERYONE was in solidarity (like imagine a general strike of ALL student workers, how the university would have to cave into requests to prevent complete chaos),  the idea of withholding labor and what counts as scabbing, how worldwide class solidarity should override your personal experiences, how unions even work in the first place?

As a student who is entirely dependent on financial aid for my continued enrollment at this school, I have been very concerned about the fact that there is a severe lack of information being provided in regards to how financial aid will be affected by the strike. So my roommate and I took a trip to financial aid and we thought it would be useful to share what we were told by financial aid with all of you:

- **Financial aid has already sent out emails to anyone who may be affected by the strike** we were assured that the only thing that could affect financial aid is in regards to academic standing, and they assured us they have sent out emails with instructions to anyone who may need them. If you did not receive an email you are likely fine.

- **To receive financial aid for next quarter students with financial aid need to be enrolled in a minimum of 6 credits** they said they could not speak to how enrollment may be affected by the strike, so further questions regarding that would be best taken to individual departments, but a minimum of 6 credits is required up to the add/drop/swap deadline, after that deadline a full load (12 units) is required, to receive financial aid distribution.

- **Financial aid is checked yearly and not quarterly** so again if you did not receive an email from financial aid, it is likely your financial aid is checked yearly as opposed to quarterly. Even though disbursements are quarterly, grade checks are not.

Hopefully this is helpful to whoever may be looking for answers to their concerns about financial aid. Good luck everyone on your final exams!"

These are minor complaints about the flyer itself, not the movement behind it.  


Now, with that out of the way, here goes.  


**""These Al Capones of the University...""**

Al Capone was actually relatively well known in his day for using his money to support local soup kitchens during the Great Depression and various charities, expressly helping out the less fortunate with his illegal actions ([https://www.ssa.gov/history/acoffee.html](https://www.ssa.gov/history/acoffee.html)). Add onto that the pluralization of ""Al Capone"" is iffy at best. This should not be the type of comparison you're trying to make when vilifying an administration. Personally, I'd prefer a Harding reference, but knowing that's likely a forgotten figure in the modern day, ""gangsters"" should be a fine substitute.

 **""...are headed by veteran charlatan Janet Napolitano... ...architect of the deportation of hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants, as head of Homeland Security from 2009-2013""**

Okay, so a few problems with this. First things first, ""veteran charlatan"" is a good leading message. Now the issue is committing to it. You think she's a charlatan, and has experience being one. Great! But being head of Homeland Security and deporting ""hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants"" is not an example of being a charlatan, it's an example of doing what a Homeland Security Head does. Pull out your other examples, prove to your audience that she's had other experience *beyond* the ""recent state audit"".   
Speaking of, big props citing the specific newspaper and date (SF Chronicle, 11/18/2017) as it lends legitimacy to your point. 

**""What was the penalty? Nothing nearly as severe as what this University administration is threatening us...""**

But what WAS the penalty, and what are you being threatened with? It's not like you couldn't have inserted it in without detracting from your message. For example, ""***No ice cream***, nothing nearly as severe as the ***public executions*** this University administration is threatening us..."". Obviously, replace the bolded italicized portions with the penalty and threats respectively, but you get the point.

**""...continuously engaged in a politics of mystification""**

I personally would prefer ""*the* politics of mystification"" or no article at all. If ""the"" is ""the genuine article"", ""a"" feels like something more acceptable, more common, like it's not something super important. 

**""the fact is that this is no longer the case, and we know it. They know it too.""**

The word ""that"" is unnecessary, and there has to be a way to combine these two sentences. ""The fact is this is no longer the case. We know it, and they know it too."" combines the two ""know""s into a stronger message, while ""The fact is this is no longer the case; we know it and they know it too"" gets a fancy shmancy semicolon, though the colon would need to be changed to a period since two fancy punctuation marks would be a *bit* extra.

**""But make no mistake, the University is not in... ...penalize us when we act together;""**

Oh hey look a fancy shmancy semicolon! Props to using it correctly. The same can't be said for your starting ""But"". The ""but"" in this case should refute the previous statement, and ""Make no mistake, the University is not in a position..."" is a perfectly strong sentence without a superfluous conjunction.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anywho, just a few extra notes.   
**1.** Y'all should aim for more thematic consistency with your word usage. ""Shipwreck our movement"" is out of place on its own, and can only gain thematic strength if you use other ship-related terminology, such as ""overwhelm"" and ""capsize"" on the administrative side, and ""sail forward"" for yours. Evoke the inspirational image of struggling sailors weathering the storm, refusing to be capsized by the hot air being blown by the administration.   
**2.** I don't think ""cynical"" was the right word to describe the admin's message of diversity, inclusivity, and commitment. ""Two-faced"", ""deceptive"", or ""fraudulent"" would be more apt for the message you're trying to send. You are ""cynical"" about their message, sure, but the rhetoric itself is fine.  
**3.** Some grammar nerds prefer a colon that splits two independent clauses have the word after the colon be capitalized, but that's a massive debate I don't need to get into. Suffice it to say I prefer semicolons for two independent clauses specifically to avoid this fight.  
**4.** I would've liked to see the word ""traffic"" somewhere. ""Trafficked in \_\_\_\_"", ""Trafficking in \_\_\_\_"", that sort of thing. I dunno, I just really like that word. It's a good catch-all for something illegal.  
**5.** Good work on the active voice, and whoever wrote this does have strong verb choice down, though divorced from any thematic consistency. 

Oh and for legal and/or administrative reprisal purposes, I am not using this to take a side, I simply want to see stronger persuasive writing in flyers I'm too socially inept to refuse.

I tried to petition to substitute a physics class but was rejected. Taking another quarter is unfortunately not an option for me. What can I do?**

I'm a moron because I missed a midterm for one of my classes because the syllabus was formatted weirdly and I accidentally went during the wrong time. Unfortunately that meant an automatic fail for that class because we needed a passing grade on the two midterms combined. 

I begged my professor for another chance or at least try to pass with a zero on the midterm but he didn't let me. Worst part is that it probably wouldn't have happened except I got robbed about a week before it, and didn't have access to canvas or my email without my phone.

Went to major counseling, and I managed to change it to an NP grade but then I'd still be missing one last elective to graduate. 

Physics was mandatory for transferring when I did, but is no longer required in the newer CS curriculum. I tried to petition to have it count as my last class, since they even let you take certain math classes now, but I got denied. So the class was essentially a waste but meh. 

I already basically failed out of CC in the past so this was already my second chance. I was actually on track for once and then this shit happens. My parents aren't really gonna give me a 3rd chance, so taking another quarter isn't possible. I can't even bother facing them, or my friends who all graduated two years ago, after telling them I'd finally be done this quarter. 

Has anyone ever been in a situation like this? I was praying for the petition to work but now I'm freaking out. I even went to student counseling because this is taking a huge toll on my mental health. Does the department ever provide exceptions for certain situations? It's just one elective and if I literally can't get my degree because of that, that just sucks. Could DRC accommodations help?"

As the title says, I'm an older student at UCSC and I work for a pretty big union as a union organizer. We've been talking about the UAW trike at my work and when this most recent email came out I feel like I had to address it.

Essentially this email is a bunch of BS. Starting with the title of calling the strike an ""Illegal work stoppage"". That is obvious branding to put the strike in a negative light and avoid acknowledging any legitimacy of the complaints of the strikers. This is a pretty basic anti-strike tactic.


Then
&gt; ""The high cost of housing and the lack of affordable housing is a problem that impacts many people in our campus community and is one of our highest and most urgent priorities. We are continuing to develop solutions both for the short- and long-term and want to broadly engage with our graduate student community to discuss solutions for greater support in the face of this severe housing crisis. ""

This is essentially the ""All Lives Matter"" response to the grad student strike. No grad students have said that housing is unaffordable ONLY for them. They're simply trying to address their specific needs in a way that fits the situation of their relationship with the UC.  

&gt;""We look forward to engaging with graduate students in their role as students once the illegal work stoppage ends. UC Santa Cruz cannot negotiate a cost of living adjustment, which would be a change to the terms and conditions of employment for members of UAW, while they are under contract. Last year, the University of California negotiated a four-year contract with UAW 2865, the union that represents TAs, readers, tutors and graduate student instructors spanning the ten UC campuses across the state. To discuss terms and conditions of employment, our campus must work through and with the systemwide UAW 2865 organization.""

This is mostly BS with a few kernels of truth. To be absolutely frank, the UAW screwed up badly when they negotiated their contract. I don't know any folks there and I don't know the details of how this contract was negotiated but it was not done well. UAW is a union whose membership covers a large geographic area. Generally when a union represents a body of workers that spread out they negotiate a base wage for their workers and then negotiate what's called a supplemental contract that addresses the differences in cost of living in different areas. Like I said, I don't know the details here but not negotiating one here *looks like* a pretty big oversight on their part which has led to the grad students depending on the UC to make up for the cost of living difference out of the kindness of its heart, which is a big ask for a business. That said, the UC is being dishonest here and that they can absolutely decide to pay their grad students more. Wages negotiated by a union are a base and a minimum, not a maximum. So that aspect of this email is utter crap. 


**tl;dr: This email is horseshit, our grad students are getting screwed by the UC and potentially by their own union. Give them your support and stand in solidarity. Changes like this tend to have cascading effects that can improve lives for not just our grad students but our campus workers and even us undergrads as well.**"

The multiverse oracled my mind again today.

I still feel the resonant pang

Of time quaking on my skin

As some foreign demonic entity

Struck the match of my death drive 

with a torch of billions of burning eyes.

As I finally fissured this presence

Out of my suddenly gaping wound body

I ruptured my jagged motions for a moment

And as Body standstilled, it shed a single tear from my right eye.

I won.

I won.

I won.

My every ancestor in a choral infinitude 

of roseshaped amphitheaters 

all concentricizing me.

Every one of their pineal cones

blasting light onto a formless 

demon in the center of my vision.

Every candlelit quark of their rays

flattening airborne molecules into an 

ether-film cocoon trap

of smoothly textured 

seablue plexiglassplastic.

The demon screamed inside this shell

and banged the inner doors 

with anticlaustrophobia in its veins.

An alienesque demon with 

two big house fly eyes.

Tiny hexagons envisioning rehearsals 

of every possible

choreography of ripping my heart

out my coronary cavity

and semicannibalizing it 

between his charred molars.

Each microeye a cinema for swallowing hurricanes

Vivid scenes of murderous self-destruction.

Unspeakable things I will not even zoom into in my mind's eye to even think about writing.

...

As many unsheathed spears for teeth 

as bloodpainted theatres for eyes.

Skin a sickly putrid muted green.

Disgust inside a humanoid sack of cells.

My bloodthirsty visceral shadow.

Hexed his ass into a coma and into Virtual Surrealism™️

Where he can do whatever the fuck he wants but he's all alone in a field of infinite greenery.

Writhing with consumptuous destruction.

Unearthing every root, wrecking every trunk.

He seems

Happy.

The tiny virtuous conscious part of him 

rebirthed into his corporeal body 

with a small bot helmet 

faciltating his consciousness.

In this plane of existence,

He's much nicer and empathetic 

at the moment. I know this isn't

permanent but 

it's good enough for now.

Enough! 

as in,

I'm the fucking God of this body, not you. 

Shut the fuck up.

Stop telling me I'm going to die out of absolutely nowhere.

These hurricane theater thoughts are not mine.

You make me fucking sick.

I deserve so much better than for you 

to intrude on my 

holy terrain of cathedral Body.

I still store moonlight in my veins

I'll beat the shit out of you with it.

I AM FUCKING ANGRY.

I AM FUCKING LIVID 

WITH LOVE FOR MYSELF.

DEFENDING THIS BODY 

WITH MY LITERAL LIFE.

THE BEST PAIR OF 

PARADOXES THERE IS:

BODY AND LIFE.

I'll condense every bow and arrow and mortar and ammunition and pestle and sledgehammer and artillery 

into a single ray of light.

And ignite 963 chains of 

lavender copal fireworks 

each with a carbon copy of its bright essence

To 4thofJuly your ass back into outer space and dark matter.

I'll light-pollution each seat in your movie screenings until your corneas burst

Fluid chains of pure light and sacred smoke

waterfalling out your pitifully mangled eyesockets

I've already locked your throat

into a name 

and a 

haunted hollow symphony:

WOUND.

WOUND.

WOUND.

Watch me dance over the 

unwound yard of graves

I'm still digging for you. 

The ones I will never finish 

but since you've been trying to bury me, 

it's either your life or mine.

I move fucking mountains inside my landscape head with a single meditative recollection.

The fuck you think I'll do 

to your tinyass hills?

Vete a la chingada.

How dare you trespass.

Don't fucking try me.

See how you end up next time.

Autocannabilistic piece of sh----

Piece of me.

Piece

That I will let roam in contained surreal environments

I see the small eyelet

in the middle of your head

like some geode

and it looks like 

mine.

Dark brown iris.

But it's much a part of me

As a drop is within an entire ocean

Of self-exorcism.

I'll keep the fucking change,

thank you very much.

The rest of your imbalance

can rot 

in the most frigid 

wintered pits 

of Hell.

Exhale."

&amp;#x200B;

Disclaimer: I got the following information from the internet, so... yeah.

Here's the current TA salary breakdown from the SOE website:

&amp;#x200B;

|Position |Workload|Monthly Salary|Hourly Wage  |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|TA, 25%|10 hours per week|$1181.83|$29.55 |
|TA, 50%|20 hours per week |$2363.66|$29.55|

&amp;#x200B;

(Additionally, TAs receive ""remission for in-state fees"". I will ignore this in the calculations.)

The proposed cost of living adjustment of $1,412 would increase graduate student wages (for 50% TAs) to (2363.66+1412.00)/(4\*20)=$47.20/hr. (it's a lot higher for 25% TAs)

For reference, Undergraduates working at the dining hall have a starting wage of $12/hr.

Tuition costs are roughly equivalent for graduate students and undergraduate students, as are the costs of housing.

I support the right of the grad students to share their discontent with their situation, and completely disagree with the university's categorization of the strike as ""illegal"". However, it seems like if anyone needs a pay bump, it's the undergrads. Why should students working for $12-15/hr with the same housing and tuition costs as their TAs be subsidizing a further pay increase to over triple what they are making. 

Degree programs, especially those of graduate students, shouldn't be thought of as cheap or break-even endeavors. The promise of a degree (or at least the hope these days) is to increase future earnings by foregoing current earnings. In a perfect world, both sets of students get raises, but I just don't understand the humanitarian need for TAs to get a $47/hr wage before undergraduates come even close to $20/hr. 

Please help me understand what I'm missing."

Provide a Cost of Living Adjustment for all. The largest employer in Santa Cruz county and the greatest contributor to the city’s population, UCSC is substantially responsible for driving up local housing costs. Recognizing this negative impact, UCSC must provide a monthly COLA in order to bring all full-time employees and half-time student employees out of rent burden. No worker may earn poverty wages. No hours may be cut to meet this demand.

Cops off campus. No arrests for civil disobedience or non-violent offenses. Funds released in this manner can go towards the above demand.

Suspend tuition. Return to pre-1975 cost of attendance. 1/2 of the federal government’s assets are comprised of student debt.

Guarantee free room and board for all incoming students. This will help ensure a campus growth rate based on sustainability rather than profit.

Abide by a binding and transparent democratic procedure for community decision-making and campus resource management.

The construction design itself is fairly simple, so realistically it shouldn't take long for someone who knows what they are doing (the person I semi modeled this idea after did it in just over an hour with help from a friend). And I have all of the materials for it. 

I know most people have gone home for break by now but anyone who is sticking around who has some experience, let me know. The only caveat is I'm only in town for a few days. Most likely the 22nd and 23rd.

So, the workers are currently under contract, right? That means that some of the graduates organized and agreed to the terms of their contracts which *everyone signed*; these terms included no obstructive protesting and their salaries. So, basically, we’re going back on what we already agreed to? Which *would* technically be illegal?

Also, they’re asking for quite a large increase in salary ($17,000/yr). I don’t know how many graduate students there are asking for this huge raise, but even if every administrator volunteered to edit their contracts and cut their salaries down to 2/3rds original (which they would never do), if their average pay is like $300k-$600k/yr, wouldn’t each administrator only cover a few students?

This is the biggest part that bothers me. The administrators **are not** going to volunteer their salaries. They’re probably going to cut programs instead if the graduate students don’t stop (even though they said they would not discuss terms during the illegal work stoppage but would afterwards). So, everyone else is either gonna get raised tuition, or we’re gonna lose programs on campus, but the administrators are still gonna get their bag.

I understand the need for COLA, 100%. I don’t understand why this 1. wasn’t addressed when the contract was made 2. is being done in the middle of the year at the expense of other students 3. why people actually think admins being overpaid means anything at all to this because that will never change.

For people who say “this doesn’t inconvenience other students,” I don’t get how. It’s harder for the university to budge than the grad students. The university already allotted money to the budget and the grads are asking for *a lot* of money. Even if the university gave in, *where are they getting the money?* Who’s going to pay for this? Is it going to be me?

**P.S. I’M OPEN TO HAVING MY OPINION CHANGED!!! I’m asking these questions in good faith. These are genuine confusions on my part and I really want to believe that this stoppage is a good thing. I’m having a hard time seeing the silver lining. Help me see it.**"

Earlier today, the Registrar's office sent an email to faculty making inaccurate and previously dispelled misconceptions. Given that many of the concerns undergrads on this subreddit express reflect those same misconceptions that the Registrar's office just repeated, I wanted to share with all of you relevant parts of the response the graduate students just sent out in response.

&gt;   
Dear UCSC Community,  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Earlier today, the Office of the Registrar sent an email to instructors telling them to submit any missing grades. This email warned of consequences to undergraduate students, including potential disqualification, being unable to enroll in classes that require a prerequisite taken this quarter, and delays in financial aid and graduation. **This letter is inaccurate:** at best, it is a boilerplate letter that was not changed to reflect the measures in place due to the grading strike, or at worst, it is a deliberate attempt to spread misinformation. We sincerely hope that the former is the case, but regardless, we want to dispel the myths contained therein.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Graduate students, faculty and staff across UCSC have taken measures to mitigate the potential negative impacts of the strike to undergraduates. These measures include:  
&gt;  
&gt;  
1) No students will be disqualified or barred from enrolling next quarter as a result of missing grades. Graduate student strikers received the following message from college provosts: ""After much consideration, the Council of Provosts, which oversees Academic Standing Review, has decided to waive academic review for Fall 2019. This means that students will not be reviewed or subject to barment this quarter and thus, we do not need TAs to inform us of student grades.""  
2) No students will be dropped from or barred from enrolling in courses that require a prerequisite taken in Fall 2019. According to the FAQ published by UCSC Public Affairs, ""Students with missing grades will not be dropped from future courses that require completion of the course as a prerequisite. Satisfaction of prerequisite courses is not verified until after a final grade has been assigned.""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
3) For students in extenuating circumstances (e.g. financial aid probation, graduating and urgently need their graduation processed), striking graduate students have offered to submit individual grades at the students' request. Students do not need to disclose their reason for needing their grades urgently in order to have their grades submitted - we have advised striking grads to submit grades for any student who says they need their grade urgently, no questions asked. The Office of the Registrar has made a process available for submitting partial grade rosters, so these students will have their grades officially processed, and will not suffer any consequences as a result of the strike. This process is outlined in an email sent out to instructors by the Registrar and also on the COLA campaign website ([https://payusmoreucsc.com/](https://payusmoreucsc.com/)).  
&gt;  
&gt;  
For more information about how undergraduate students may be affected and the measures in place to protect them, please see the FAQ pages for grad students ([https://payusmoreucsc.com/f-a-q/](https://payusmoreucsc.com/f-a-q/)), faculty ([https://payusmoreucsc.com/359-2/](https://payusmoreucsc.com/359-2/)) and undergrads ([https://payusmoreucsc.com/f-a-q-for-undergrads/](https://payusmoreucsc.com/f-a-q-for-undergrads/)) on the COLA campaign website.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Instructors: please continue to support the graduate students' fight for a COLA and do not submit your grades, except for those special case students who requested that their grades be released. If you are being pressured by the administration to enter grades that would normally be entered by TAs or readers in order circumvent the strike, it is important to know that the university cannot force you to do this additional work. For more information, please see the statements of support issued by the Santa Cruz Faculty Association ([https://payusmoreucsc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/SCFA-Solidarity-Statement-12\_11\_19-1.pdf](https://payusmoreucsc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/SCFA-Solidarity-Statement-12_11_19-1.pdf)) and the Faculty Organizing Group ([https://payusmoreucsc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Faculty-Organizing-Group-Statement-of-Solidarity.pdf](https://payusmoreucsc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Faculty-Organizing-Group-Statement-of-Solidarity.pdf)).  
&gt;  
&gt;  
We care deeply about our undergraduate students and have gone to great lengths to minimize any potential harmful short-term impacts of the strike on them. In the long term, a COLA will improve the quality of education on this campus, as graduate students will have the time and resources to do our best for our students, instead of being over-burdened by poverty, stress, and the external jobs that we need to take on to make ends meet. Our working conditions are their learning conditions. We are seeking to improve them for all of us."

**While a petition circulated around the esteemed faculty, I was never sent a survey link asking for my feedback or my vote.** 

When the TAs voted on whether to strike or not, they didn't consult any students. My TAs never even asked the students in their own sections, yet they still claim solidarity between undergraduate and graduate students.

Last I checked, solidarity involves mutual agreement. How can we agree on something if we were never asked? This strike was put into motion LONG before any student opinions were voiced on this forum.

If I had been asked, I would have said ""Yes, under the condition that my grades be submitted eventually even if the school says no"". 

But strikes don't work like that do they? Every revolution theory class I've ever been in has emphasized the *disruptive* and *violent* part of a strike. COLA emphasizes disrupting the university, but in reality their movement rests on disrupting their students' lives and interests. That's why this strike dropped in without any warning to the students. 

The first time I heard about this strike was from a TA who said they did not support the strike and that they would still support us students by giving us our grades. **The next time I ever officially heard from my other TAs was to see long, performative, flowery speeches on canvas about living cost difficulties, strike theory and solidarity, only for them to never respond to any of my emails asking to know what my grade was.** 

**I think TAs are willing to let us lose our grades completely if they don't get what they want, all in the name of fighting university oppression.**

The TAs may say they are protecting their students' best interests, but something tells me this is somewhat of a front. The language used in both the school and the COLA emails is very calculated and political. Ultimately the TAs want a monetary raise, regardless of their undergraduate students. Call me paranoid, but I have a feeling this movement isn't going to end well. **COLA has yet to say what their plan will be if the school doesn't budge an inch.** 

All I want to say is, the TAs' words say one thing, but their actions say another. I hope I'm wrong and things will be resolved soon. If our TAs choose to go the extreme route, I hope they at least own up to it and say that they sacrificed our grades for their own interests. I can understand the need, but they shouldn't lie to themselves, hiding behind this notion of solidarity and integrity. If you really want to practice what you preach, be honest with yourself about the consequences of your actions."

I will go back and edit this post in bold if there are any factual mistakes that need correcting. 

Many undergraduate students have to pay for their tuition, which includes mandatory on-campus dorm fees for the first year at least. Living on campus, by the way, is significantly more expensive. The majority of students have taken on multiple jobs to handle this, including things like serving at restaurants, working at dining halls and managing the front desk at a hotel. They somehow manage to do this while juggling their schoolwork. The vast majority of them leave with crippling student debts.

In comparison, TAs get their tuition covered by their TA position, as part of a small salary. Their TA *job* is part time and legally capped at 20 hours, which means they are free to take on another job like many undergraduate students do. They say they are unable to do so because of schoolwork, but undergraduates do schoolwork in addition to tiring jobs like working at the dining hall, so what gives?

I feel like I'm missing part of the equation. **How is it that TAs  are better off than more undergraduate students and yet say that they can barely survive?**

Of course, it's not like TAs are swimming in luxury either, no more than their students are. **My point is that it's pretty bad for all of us, so I think the university is already stretched pretty thin in terms of budgeting the tuition costs, the campus upkeep, the program costs, the faculty salaries and so on.** **The system is already all over the place, and the TAs seem to be asking for unreasonable concessions to be made to them considering the situation for everyone else.**"

Undergrad freshman here. I had recently noticed a comment on Canvas from my TA saying that he couldn’t find a file I turned in for one of my assignments. Said comment was a week old by the time I saw it. I didn’t think to check because I thought I turned everything in and therefore shouldn’t have anything to worry about.

It might be important to note that this assignment consists of multiple components to be turned in, specifically a YouTube video and a document containing my reflection of the process of creating the video. I turned them in separately. The video seemed to have overrode the document, but checking the comment section on the Canvas app on my phone suggests otherwise.

I have also tried to contact my TA via email regarding this matter after posting a comment of my own on that assignment with the supposedly missing file attached to it. I have yet to hear back from him.

I find this worrisome on multiple levels. Was I too late in attempting to take corrective action? Would my TA believe me when I say I turned it in when I was supposed to? What else can I do about this?

The result of this so far is me fretting over whether or not I’m going to pass this class instead of enjoying my break as this assignment counts for 25% of the grade for this class. 

Also, to avoid hiccups of similar nature in the future, I would like to ask those of you who have more experience with Canvas about how you turn in multiple submissions of multiple formats for one assignment. Thank you in advance.

TL;DR: did not know how to turn in multiple submissions of different formats for one assignment. TA couldn’t find word document that I thought I turned in. Attached said document with a comment on the assignment, no response from TA so far. Losing my mind due to possibility of failing the class.

I do have some questions about UCSC though, because, as a Dutchie, the way the American school system works is very confusing to me.

First of all, are we obliged to take the health insurance UCSC offers us? Or can we look for another one that might be less expensive? 

Secondly, how many courses do you guys usually take in one quarter? At my uni, it is the norm to take two courses in one quarter, but our quarters are shorter than yours.

Lastly, how much do you pay for a form at the UCSC campus? We’re advised to apply for a dorm at the international house or smt, but I’ve heard that it’s pretty expensive to live there.

I hope some of you can help me out!

Some have asked if it is possible that Tantalo and AVG could switch sections, only to be denied. I am wondering if it is possible to change the professor for 102-02 altogether. Time and time again, the department gives AVG CSE 102 and the students don’t take him as they feel they won’t learn anything. This quarter, for a change, they put in someone other than AVG only for the class to fill up on the first day of enrollment and the waitlist to outnumber the class size. When they added the additional section, the department only sent the follow up email that it’s to be taught by AVG after people started to enroll. Personally, I feel deceived and cheated that they emailed us AFTER people started to enroll. As much as I understand that the department has some issues regarding understaffing and overpopulation of students, there is only so much we can take. Last quarter after the department emailed us regarding Professor David Harrison’s inability to make it to the classes he was to teach, they never even sent a followup email as to who was to teach the classes he was originally supposed to. Instead I ended up finding out through Reddit and the BSOE website that Ethan Miller and Charlie McDowell had taken over his classes, just days before fall quarter instruction began. While I could understand Miller taking over as the course was something he taught before the reshaping of the departments, I could not understand why the department had brought a retired professor who hadn’t taught the class in over 25 years and threw him on us without even a notice or an email. If they can do such things for courses like CSE 112 and 130, surely the department could have someone other than AVG teach the course. I feel it wasn’t fair for the students who enrolled and expected Tantalo for the additional section to receive the email saying it was AVG after they enrolled. That is why I ask if it is possible the department could change the professor for 102-02, given the faculty still there. It was brought to my attention that there was an incident where faculty here and from other universities came to the conclusion that AVG doesn’t know what he’s doing and is only around because he’s tenured. If such is the case, then AVG should be investigated, much like Dimitris now. If the department could look into how quickly a class fills up based on instructor, they would see that AVG’s courses don’t even reach halfway and many drop his courses in the first week. Please, I urge the department to actually see the trends in enrollment, and if possible please consider somebody else to teach CSE 102-02 this quarter."

Since the beginning of our grading strike, the  administration has repeatedly refused to meet with us. Instead of  resolving this issue, they are hoping to break our strike by sewing  confusion and fear amongst undergraduate students and faculty. 

 It is not our intention to hurt undergraduate students. The university  administration will do everything to pit undergraduates against graduate  students—to drive a wedge of anger and confusion through our  solidarity. We cannot allow this to happen! The university that doesn’t  pay graduate students enough to live here is the same university that  shackles you in student debt. The university makes its profits off of  your student loans and our unjust wages.

UCSC, which calls itself  a public university, charges you exorbitantly high tuition, which most  of you can only meet by taking on huge amounts of student debt with high  interest rates. Your tuition is rising and your debt is rising, while  the product you are indebted for—your education—is decreasing in  quality. Your learning conditions are our working conditions. Your TAs  cannot adequately do the work we do if the university refuses to pay us  enough to live here. In short: your struggle and our struggle are the  same.

Graduate students, faculty and staff across UCSC have taken  measures to mitigate the potential negative impacts of the strike to  undergraduates. These measures include:

1) No students will be  disqualified or barred from enrolling next quarter as a result of  missing grades. Graduate student strikers received the following message  from college provosts: “After much consideration, the Council of  Provosts, which oversees Academic Standing Review, has decided to waive  academic review for Fall 2019. This means that students will not be  reviewed or subject to barment this quarter and thus, we do not need TAs  to inform us of student grades.”

2) No students will be dropped  from or barred from enrolling in courses due to a missing grade in a  prerequisite taken in Fall 2019. According to the FAQ published by UCSC  Public Affairs, “Students with missing grades will not be dropped from  future courses that require completion of the course as a prerequisite.  Satisfaction of prerequisite courses is not verified until after a final  grade has been assigned.”

Although students will not be dropped  due to missing grades in a prerequisite course, if you failed the  prerequisite, you will be dropped from the next course in the sequence  once this failing grade is submitted. We don't want any students to be  surprised by being dropped after the quarter starts due to receiving a  failing grade. If you are concerned that you may have failed the course  you took with me in the Fall, please contact me. If you fill out and  email me a FERPA waiver (attached to this email with instructions  provided on [payusmoreucsc.com](http://payusmoreucsc.com/) website; click here to read them), I will then be able to email you your grade directly.

 3) For students in extenuating circumstances (e.g. financial aid  probation, graduating and urgently need their graduation processed),  striking graduate students have offered to submit individual grades at  the students’ request. Students do not need to disclose their reason for  needing their grades urgently in order to have their grades submitted –  we have advised striking grads to submit grades for any student who  says they need their grade urgently, no questions asked. The Office of  the Registrar has made a process available for submitting partial grade  rosters, so these students will have their grades officially processed,  and will not suffer any consequences as a result of the strike. This  process is outlined in an email sent out to instructors by the Registrar  and also on the COLA campaign website ([https://payusmoreucsc.com/](https://payusmoreucsc.com/)).

I thought about majoring in film because it interested me, but I ended up choosing CS. I don’t hate it, but I’m not totally happy with it. But I took Film 80S last spring and loved it. It made me want to take more film classes.

I’ve been thinking about a film minor for a while, and it seems that I would need to start this quarter to make it possible. The film and digital media department told me the first steps, but I (regrettably) put off looking into the program until the last minute and I’m not totally sure what I’m getting into or if I should do it at all.

Could any film students share some of their thoughts on the program here? Is 80S a good example of what the program is like? Would the work load be too much to handle on top of CS (it would be one film class and two CS classes most quarters)? Is it worth it?

And finally, I’m not really sure how a minor works here. Will I be able to drop it if it doesn’t work out?

My current plan see if I can talk to an advisor on Monday before the first 20C class happens.

If we have solidarity, we are in agreement, our opinions and well-being are respected, and we have the right to refuse to participate.

#  Would strikers be willing to release student grades to any student who asks, simply because the student no longer wishes to have their grades involved in the strike? If the majority of the students are in solidarity, then this won't affect the strike too much, because most students' grades will still be missing right? 

Because if you're afraid to let us walk out, then this isn't solidarity. This is pretty much just a crappy hostage situation, and your paper promises of ""solidarity"", ""protection"", and ""care"" are there to placate us like children. If it actually turns out that the majority of the students want their grades back and don't want to be part of your strike, then can you still claim solidarity?

 I'm curious what your answer will be. (How might we interpret silence? Special shout-out to strike representative u/ladut so this is seen.) I can't tell what ""strike theory"", placating response we'll get next.  Or maybe we won't get an answer at all, despite the strikers' emphasis on how *they're* not to blame for any communication breakdowns regarding grades. Maybe they just can't risk any situation that could result in definite proof that the majority of students don't want to be part of the strike.

**If I'm just the salty loud minority, then let my grades go. Let the small crowd of ""scabby"", complaining students just get their grades back. They'll retreat to the distance and stop complaining right? It'll be a win-win for all of us. You'll have definite proof that the majority of the students are firmly in solidarity with you all, and you can silence all the non-supportive students by giving their grades back.**"

Awards: I’ll graduate as a scholar with distinction which is the highest honor for graduates at my school.  

Extracurriculars: founded my school’s astronomy club because even though i don’t have any interest in pursuing science, astronomy fascinates me. I’m VP of the club. I’ve also played soccer for 13 years, most of it on club but i stopped this year because of mental health and injuries. I didn’t play for my school team because of my mental health and also, and this sounds snobby i know, but because the quality of play is shit and the risk of injury is high. I volunteer at my local library shelving and reading and one of my future job aspirations is a librarian 

Other: I feel like my essays were pretty strong so I’m not too worried about them, but I’m terrified that I didn’t do enough throughout high school because I told myself I would just go to community college to save money

Quarterly strikes by AFSCHME have had no effect on the university's ability to function. The largest dining halls remained open and the administration has become emboldened by strikers' inability to meaningfully impede the university. This wildcat strike has no staying power. The grad students have less power than AFSCHME and 80%+ of grades have already been submitted. UCSC is perfectly willing to let grad students starve and fuck over the students whose grades haven't been submitted. Striking has proven to be near-completely ineffective due to the massive power imbalance between unions and power holders. Unless something changes (strikers start blocking entrances again, occupying buildings permanently, etc.), strikers are only prolonging the inevitable and hurting the grad students who withheld grades (who are now a significant minority and can be made an example of) and inconveniencing students."

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Dear all,  
&gt;  
&gt;The Administration refuses to meet with graduate students and student workers to negotiate a COLA. Instead of settling this matter, they are attempting to intimidate graduate strikers with misconduct violations and nebulous threats of retaliation.  In the most recent emails sent to undergraduates by Academic Advisors and EVC Lori Kletzer, it has become clear that the University’s strategy is to break the strike by confusing and misleading undergraduate students about potential impacts.   
&gt;  
&gt;We are gathering for a MASSIVE Student-Worker-Power rally at **12pm**, **Thursday 9th January**, outside of Kerr Hall. We need everyone to SHOW UP! **There, we will tell administration: undergraduates will NOT be the wedge that breaks this strike.** Undergraduates support this strike. We don’t ask TAs for our grades; rather, we ask administration to pay their workers a living wage!   
&gt;  
&gt;This strike does not harm undergraduate students. This grading strike energizes us and reaffirms that we too can fight for--and win--the kind of university we want. It empowers us to make and advance our own demands: for free tuition, liveable and affordable housing, cops off campus, resources for undocumented students, and more! It empowers AFSCME workers who are still without a contract, and who have undergraduate support! Together, we have power! Students and workers RUN UC!

I’m in the film program in my third production class. The film students in production get special access to editing and other production facilities 24/7 on both weekdays and weekends for their projects in the comm building. Well this week we all found out we’re gonna lose that access as it’s now restricted 7–10pm m-f only. Not because of a new rule or anything, but because to get in there’s these special locks we have to use so no random person can come in. Those locks failed halfway last quarter and now they’re entirely out this quarter. What makes the worst part of it all is that apparently there’s no effort from admin to fix this. You should have seen the look on everyone’s faces, I personally wanted to vomit. 

The staff who run the day-to-day at the building have been trying so hard and to find out they’re powerless because the admin above them couldn’t be bothered to put in any effort makes me speechless. 

No other labs on campus have the software needed except for one with shorter hours and I’m poor as hell I can’t afford the software or get a powerful enough computer to run it. 

This hurts us SO badly because of how time consuming it is to put together our projects, tie that in with actually having to film our projects, meet extremely tight deadlines not even considering the 2-3 other classes, work, extra curriculars, and other things students may or may not have like what the fuck. 

From my understanding of what we were told, the admin in the division do not want to put the effort in for new locks because the current ones could not be repaired? If this was my only class I feel as if I could make it work but that is not the case here. This much intentional restriction is gonna make this by far a wild quarter that I am not looking forward to. I’m worried as fuck for some of my classmates they don’t deserve this bs. Fuck this place. 

TLDR: arts/film admin know we’re struggling but don’t care and couldn’t care"

I'm a porter resident living at the porter apartments, and for this last year there has been an incessant banging in my walls. Every night from around midnight to five in the morning.

Every. Single. Night.

Sometimes it's quiet, like some coy little guest tapping on my door. Sometimes it's a loud banging, like some stoned ingrate slamming the pipes with a hammer.

I think it's coming from the piping going to the heater on my wall. It seems to stop for a few minutes if I turn it on, but turning it off always starts it for the next thirty minutes. My friends on the other side of the wall don't seem to any noises. 

I submitted a fixit. They ""fixed it"". This was last quarter.

I can't take this anymore. My rage is only matched in intensity by my bloodlust. If anyone has any information on how to solve this please let me know. I'm about three days away from finding whoever built these apartments and b beating them over the head with a chair.

i don't really have a set job i want to do when i'm older. i really enjoy the cognitive science cirriculum and honestly anything that has to do with cog sci things i think i'll be happy with, i just want to make sure i'm being realistic about being employable in the future so i can pay off this insane debt/support myself etc. 

i plan on going to an adviser but reddit and hearing people's experiences is good for these things too in my opinion."

We released a Cloud IDE a few month ago with the superior capability to detect memory errors. Many Thanks for all the people who tested it.   Now we release another unique feature: visualizing how your code manipulates pointer and memory, and constructs data structure.   With this feature, you can record the visualized execution and replay at any program statements.   We want to test if this feature can actually help you understand data structure better, and develop your own custom data structure faster.  The ultimate goal is to significantly improve the UX of C programming language thru advanced Cloud IDE features.  Here is the link: [https://stensal.com](https://stensal.com)

Getting married would reduce my COA to around $10-15k per year according to the online calculator for it (I have some money stashed in a Roth IRA and am assuming our household income wouldn’t surpass $20k/year).

I'm a current undergrad at a different institution that is applying to the Biomolecular Engineering and Bioinformatics (BMEB) PhD program. According to [this page](https://grad.soe.ucsc.edu/bmeb/admissions), interviews take place in late January. Currently, however, my application status is still just ""submitted"", with no indication as to whether I got the interview or when the interview would be. I emailed the program contact earlier this week asking about the scheduling aspect only, so that I could make sure I had those days free if I got the interview. The only response I got was the automatic reply that indicated the email had been received. 

If there are any current students in the program that are reading this- did you go through a similar thing, only to get the interview on a short notice? Is this instead an indication that I got rejected? Final decisions are sent out starting in late February, so is there a chance that they don't update anything until then if you did not get the interview?

Alternatively, is it possible that the graduate student strikes are interfering with the timeline?

I don’t mean diverse or not. I mean segregation. I mean patronizing minorities and taking away their agency...


I think highlighting race isn’t a problem, as mlk proved.  But the *way* in which UCSC highlights race isn’t helping. It’s rarely an inclusive, positive message that motivates people, or makes them think. 

And I’ve never seen the negative sentiment I received at UCSC help others  with overcoming social/racial barriers. In fact ive observed the exact opposite. And not just with white people... 




Like some of you, I grew up poor, in a diverse city. My parents managing (not owning) a section 8 living complex. Nobody ever yelled at me that my opinions don’t matter because I’m xyz...



I have a lot of experience with race relations and the realities of growing up in a diverse city. 

I think it’s ridiculous that some very vocal and loud people in UCSC  (With a majority of them coming from privilege) will assume my entire life based off the way I look. 


I don’t want to start a rant (trying my best) but yeah. UCSC’s brand of diversity seems genuinely intentioned, but completely fails in promoting diversity and inclusion. 

If you want to change a social or cultural norm I think you need to have a message of positivity, egalitarianism, inclusion. Not splitting hairs over identity. 

Idk....


Back home it seemed like poor people realized they were all being fucked over together. And had more in common with each other. And MLK’s speeches spoke to that.


He made sure that he would be critical of white people who weren’t proactively helping. But MLK did that without excluding and segregating people of xyz racial background? 


Meanwhile at UCSC I have had people who barely knew me telling me that im rich and white and yadda yadda. That I can’t freestyle or rap (no I’m not trying to use racial slurs) because Im not black and that’s appropriating culture. 

That consistent assuming. Based off of looks and assumed privilege. It’s ridiculous. It’s not productive. And it doesn’t at all mirror the ways in which I overcame racial barriers growing up.

If I was younger or weaker. I think that kind of bullshit would backfire and turn me off from listening to real issues like police brutality or something. 

I really think that the vocal part of UCSC needs to take a not from MLK. It’s ok to criticize white people for inaction. But it’s extremely shitty to judge and assume someone’s life experience."

I have a few friends here who might have spots open up in their houses over the summer so I might just end up moving into one of those openings and spending at least a year here, but who knows how long really. I guess I’m just nervous to leave the structure of school and not have anything pushing my life forward, and I always associated moving away from here as like, moving onto the next phase of my life, but now that I might stay here I just feel weird. 

If you’ve graduated and also stayed in town for a few years, how’d it go? Were you able to find a job somewhat related to your degree, or did you get stuck working 2 or 3 minimum wage jobs for forever? When should I even start applying for “real” jobs if I can’t start them early because of spring quarter finals and stuff? I guess I’m just nervous that I’m gonna get hella depressed working 70 hours a week just to barely make rent...im also nervous that without school I’ll just lose interest in everything and not have like, a mission in life.

Finally a bus pulls up, the display was broken but a paper sign in the window said Route 19. And...as the drivers opened the door, everyone inside started chanting “Route 19! Route 19!”. Almost everyone was laughing and chanting this but I was like ok maybe it’s a club or frat or something and they were being goofy?? 

Then we got to the next bus stop...and the driver says something like “Ready?” and everyone starts doing it again! And since this bus stop had so many new people get on, as they walked in he explained that it was his very last route before retiring after driving busses for like 30 something years!!  And bonus: he was going wherever the fuck we asked him to go. Which was fantastic for me because I was already about to be late for my appointment 😩 I don’t think anyone asked to go anywhere outlandish but I think we ended up stopping in some random neighborhood and then also drove all the way down by the boardwalk roller coaster instead of turning at the driving circle by the pier.

I did use some basic 'how to read a file' functions from stack overflow and couldn't submit the README file with references because the deadline had passed and the portal closed with half my files in it :(
I am guessing that's probably why the engine might have caught a similarity. Other than that, I don't see any possible reason why it would be considered cheating.

I have a meeting with him this morning so I'll see what he has to say. Please tell me if this has ever happened to someone.  I'm just panicking for no reason.

me and my roommate are VERY different people. to the core, we experience life very differently and his views and opinions are just the opposite of mine.

I don’t know why, but since we’ve gotten back from break things have gotten worse. his backhanded comments and judgemental presence has almost gotten intolerable and have made me uncomfortable in a space I sleep, eat, and should feel completely at home.

just some of things he’s done: asked me to illegally buy me alcohol when he knows I don’t drink; has eaten an entire jar of peanut butter I bought without asking, and even moved it from the place I usually put it; has consistently made passive aggressive/backhanded comments about my major, implying that he works harder bc he’s in STEM and I don’t bc I’m in a visual arts major; has said the N word when he isn’t in any way part of the black community; has made passive aggressive/backhanded comments about my diet and my body; does not bother to bathe or even make an effort to mask the smell he radiates when he returns from the gym in the middle of the night. I could go on. 

I’m afraid to confront him directly, even though I have answered back to him after a few comments he’s made toward me, because I don’t know how he’ll react, and I’m nervous to find out how. I want to look into switching, but I know that takes time and I feel like there isn’t enough of a legitimate reason to move out. 

It’s just gotten to the point where I don’t look forward to going back home to hang out, sleep, or eat without feeling judged. I do homework at the library or study halls, eat out even when I shouldn’t bc of my budget, hang out in other friends dorms. We communicate very minimally at this point because I just want to avoid him saying something else that could be hurtful to me or others.

How can we, in that situation, secure interviews to prove we're worth hiring for summer internships, or at least willing to learn? I know quite a few of us are relying on summer internships for the real experience that school doesn't provide, and it would be nice if anyone knew what we could do to maximize our chances of getting interviews or internships during the CECI fair. Obviously other avenues for summer employment exist, but getting in front of an actual person is probably much easier when some algorithm isn't immediately trashing your resume, so I think CECI is our best chance.

Undergrads in Solidarity with the Grading Strike

Sign here: https://forms.gle/q3BYLCXwZPoRV6pf6

On January 27, Chancellor Larive sent an email to all undergraduate and graduate students titled ""Announcing two new programs for graduate students."" In addition to a lowball offer of a $2,500 a year stipend, which only *some* graduate students could apply and compete for, she escalated threats to striking students. This is not a real Cost Of Living Adjustment (COLA) offer, but rather a veiled attempt to break the strike. UCSC, you cannot give us the tools to think critically and then expect us to fall for your deceptive emails.

Chancellor Larive inappropriately threatened grad workers with disciplinary action under the student code of conduct for deleting grades from Canvas. Her reasoning? She is ""deeply concerned about the impact on undergraduates."" If you want to bring charges against TAs for harming undergraduate students, you will need to listen to actual undergraduate students.

We, the below undergraduate students, want to let the administration know: WE HAVE NOT BEEN HARMED BY THE GRADING STRIKE. For most of us, there were no consequences for not receiving grades this quarter. For others, our TAs worked with us individually to ensure that we were not negatively affected. Our TAs are on the front lines, supporting undergrads daily. Unlike admin, they have shown deep concern for our wellbeing.

Chancellor Larive claims that she is worried about the grading strike ""profoundly impacting"" financial aid. However, due to the work of striking grads and the financial aid office, financial aid has NOT been affected by the grading strike. On the other hand, students with financial aid REGULARLY receive their aid late due to understaffing of the financial aid office. Chancellor Larive, if you really cared about undergraduate students, you would address this longstanding problem rather than threatening our TAs.

Your repeated attempts to pit undergraduate students against graduate students have failed. As graduate students have mentored, supported, and cared for us, we will, in turn, support and care for them. We do not ask that graduate students upload our grades; we demand that the administration pay their workers a living wage so that graduate students no longer face unstable and insufficient living conditions. We understand that their working conditions are our learning conditions, and we demand better!

Undergraduates stand in solidarity with the wildcat strikers. We support their withholding of grades until they get a COLA. We will not cave in our solidarity and will not stop pushing back against the administration until the graduate students receive it."

Sooooo Im about to graduate in June a full year early and its fucking with my head, I feel literally hopeless because like I’m a first gen student and idk how anything works, I went to that career fair today and felt so out of place. I have nobody in my life to tell me things like how to introduce myself to employers or how to go over my resume or anything. I’m realizing I don’t know how anything in the professional world works because I come from a very low income family and I’ve had to work like 30 hrs a week while in college because my parents are poor as fuck, and as a result I don’t have any experience in my field and that’s all employers want to see, as if working 30 hours a week and graduating a year early isn’t enough to show that I have drive and ambition???? 

And it’s like, I’m already mentally ill, CAPS helped a little in 2017 but they’ve become way more crowded since then. I’m definitely not suicidal but it’s just really hard to imagine a future for myself when I have literally no support in any form and I have no idea what to do after college. I don’t have anyone in my life who I can look up to and follow what they did after college. I’m graduating a year earlier than my friends so I’m like in a different reality from them. and I’ve lost contact with my friends from here who were older,  so I literally have nobody in my life who I can look up to and who I can ask for help navigating this weird new world of trying to find a professional career. 

I just wish I could disappear after college. I regret not applying to grad school because at least that would give me some sort of structure and ambition. I don’t know. Does anyone have advice? How the fuck do I do this?"

With that said though, I do highly disagree with how the COLA strikers have been going about it. The reason for my thinking is based purely on a mistargeting of who is really at fault. In short, I believe that COLA should be targeting the city council rather than school officials. It's simply more effective to target the problem at its source, rather than place temporary patches on a wound that will ultimately strain the system more. The massive rent prices are generally due to a lack of supply in the area. If the market were working as it should be, naturally more apartments would be built to meet the increasing demand. However this clearly isn't the case. Santa Cruz homeowners have shot down any attempt by the council to zone for new housing or apartments. This is based purely on the fact that rental prices are directly linked to housing values on the market. Thus any drop in rent would subsequently devalue local housing, losing Santa Cruz residents a significant amount of money. That seems to be the root of the problem to me, and thus that's why I think that COLA's time would be better spent at the door of the council, rather than attacking the school who has been just as much a victim of the problem as everyone else. The city often rejects expansion attempts by the school to prevent the student body of increasing, which is one of the main sources of strain on local housing. If the University were allowed to expand it would mean more resources and better programs for students and the schools various functions. If the school raises wages for grad students it's likely going to be taken out of the budgets of other programs, which really isn't going to help much. I also find it unlikely that the school will meet any demands without some sort of an expensive legal battle, as I don't think that the strikes have really been effective at anything other than pissing people off. If the government gets involved in this, which with the way things seem to be going they very well may, it's hard to see any way in which COLA will win in court. Despite the fact that the union has recently made certain statements that generally seem in support of the strike, the strike itself was a breech of contract. Thus they would have no legal footing to stand on. Finally, it doesn't seem that COLA members actually have enough power to actually be making the demands that they are making. I may be wrong on this point, but it doesn't seem that any of the moves they made have significantly damaged the school in a way meaningful enough for them to even consider conceding. The strike tactics going forward should more directly target the schools pocketbook, which may be enough to at least bring the school to the negotiations table. Symbolic threats and symbolic protesting simply won't work in this situation.

I am getting pretty tired of people telling me what to do with my life and giving me advice as if they know what is best for me. 

When I first came to UCSC,  I was so sure that I wanted to go to grad school right after graduation and shoot for a PhD. However, a lot has changed since I started attending school here. I don't know about y'all but I am burnt out. I am so ready to graduate and not have to read a single research paper for a while. I also realized that I don't like research. I appreciate it and I think it is very important but it is not for me. If I don't like research, why would I try to get a PhD? Don't get me wrong, I have enjoyed learning a lot these past few years and I don't regret my time here. However, I am not mentally or financially ready to sign up for another commitment to be in school for the next few years.   


I am only 22. I have very little real-life/job experience. How am I supposed to know what I want to do with my life or what I like? There's a whole world out there and there are so many possibilities. I may decide that I do not even want to do anything related to my major and that is okay. It is my life and I need to figure it out. 

There is nothing wrong with going to graduate school right after graduation. I applaud you! But this is not the path for everyone. I am not saying I will never go back to school. Chances are I probably will but I want it to be on my own terms and when I feel passionate and I am doing it because I WANT to not because that is what is expected of me.   


It is really annoying when I am casually conversing with someone about our plans after graduation and I make it very clear what I want for myself and people, who I know very little or just barely met, try to convince me as to why I should go and that if I don't go to graduate school right after my BA, I am going to struggle and not be successful. Yes, I know that having a masters or PhD can make you a more competitive employer and you can probably earn more money, but again...it is not your life and not your decision to make."

I am a transfer who was also accepted to a UC closer to my home. I can drive to school every day if I went to the other UC I was accepted to that is closer to my home. 

 I am having issues with my ailing parents and I really need to be close to them. 

So, here are the questions:

\- How can I get to the other UC that is closer to my home? I want to go next quarter. Is that at all possible? Next year? Summer?

\- We are getting close to midterms for the quarter; when can I ""W"" without being charged for financial aid? At my old community college, they charged me if I canceled my classes within 65% of the semester. I am also in housing. 

Any other advice?

Now that I have made up my mind, I will talk to admins tomorrow, but it would be nice to get opinions here..."

ez5dsj,CSE111 How screwed am I?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/ez5dsj/cse111_how_screwed_am_i/,jamlegume,1,2020-02-04 22:48:11,20,/r/UCSC/comments/ez5dsj/cse111_how_screwed_am_i/,NaN,"So, I messed up big time on the first two assignments. Like, perfectly functioning code that passed all the tests but with the first assignment I messed up the submission so I only got 50%. The second assignment I somehow got into my head that the due date was tonight, when it was actually last night. I know, I should have been submitting while I was working, but I'm an idiot and didn't do that. So I'm going to get a 0%. 

As it is now, I can still get up to 85% in the class. The problem is, I can't get higher than 70% on the programming assignment portion and it says in the syllabus that you have to pass both the programming and the test portions separately in order to pass the class. I've heard the class gets a pretty heavy curve. Would that maybe be enough to save me? Am I just completely screwed? What frustrates me the most is that at this moment I have a 25% in this class because I made stupid little mistakes despite having two well-executed programs."

On the application page, though, it says the letter is still pending. It's due on Friday and that's when they have their office hours. I've emailed them on separate times both about meeting in person and then just asking about the status of the letter but have gotten no reply to either message. They have a habit of not replying to emails.

What should I do? Keep emailing? Talk to some administrator about this? Something else? I don't want to be rude to this professor but this internship really is a big deal and I put a lot of work into the application."

I don't know what to do anymore. I can't get into any classes I want and I feel like all my effort is going to nothing. 

This quarter, I didn't get into CSE180 off the waitlist. Last quarter, I also didn't get into CSE180 off the waitlist. The real punch in the gut is attending lecture and nobody showing up. I don't blame anyone for not showing up because the material was very straightforward. It just feels like trash to lose my spot in the class for the 2nd time to someone who isn't there.

I'm in 3 classes I don't really want to be in now. I can't find the motivation to put in effort in them. Two of them requires some creativity and I just can't find that part of myself anymore. 

I love my major. And that's what makes it so painful. I've given up on my dreams of graduating early. I used to have such a passion for this and it's dead now. I legitimately love learning, I've handled difficult courseloads and gotten good grades. 

What do I do? I don't think I can power through this quarter. I got through the last few quarters by believing the next would be better, and I am kind of sick of lying to myself now."

The people who first started gathering everyone and complaining about how they haven't ate in a few days or had a bed to sleep in would have probably graduated already.
And that's how these things go, with every right reclaimed the ones who started it all RARELY get to enjoy the fruits of the tree they planted. 
So, while right now you can only think of yourself and your self-interests there can be no moving forward until you put yourself in the shoes of someone entering college as an undergrad or grad in future years and how the support they will receive will enhance their education, their opportunities, and their quality of life.
But sadly sometimes we don't have the sociocultural and historical context to see where all of this support came from. 
That's why undocumented students on this campus are invisible. 
Because no one ever talks about how all of their activism lead to super cool things we have today that every EOP student benefits from and furthermore the larger student body hella benefits from. 
There is no moving forward until everyone knows the real story, one of invisibility and one of gatekeeping and one of silencing the narrative of the activist. 
The one who fought for YOU to be here. The one who is fighting so future students CAN be here.
Nothing is ever handed by the administration and staff. It has always been student input that gets us to where we are. So live by your values, maybe, and welcome change."

This policy is summarized in a UCSC press release from November 2019 (https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/11/faculty-diversity-grants.html). This approach to hiring is being used at other UC campuses as well (see, e.g., https://ofew.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/life_sciences_inititatve.year_end_report_summary.pdf). Why is this problematic? Several reasons, including the fact that the statement “I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character” would be given a very low rating by the rubric.

An increasing number of faculty, including me, are troubled by this approach to hiring. Faculty efforts to support diverse students _are_ important, and including diversity statements as part of an application package is a good idea. But rejecting applicants _solely_ on the basis of their diversity statement is a very bad idea, since it means potentially rejecting the best candidate. It’s no different than rejecting, sight unseen, any candidate who didn’t get their PhD from a top-10 school. Prof. Abigail Thompson (UC Davis Math Department chair) has written several editorials on this topic (https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201911/rnoti-p1778.pdf, https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-universitys-new-loyalty-oath-11576799749), capturing the issues far better than I could.

Yes, _The College Fix_ wrote an article on it too (https://www.thecollegefix.com/uc-santa-cruz-tosses-qualified-candidates-in-first-stage-of-hiring-not-diverse-enough/). The article is factually correct, drawing most of its facts from the above sources, though it has (unsurprisingly) a conservative bent to it. Read the article if you want, but definitely read the original sources above. Then, make up your own mind on the issue. But don’t pretend that it’s fake news just because it was reported on a site that you don’t agree with."

* a couple of more developers who have experience or would like to experiment with AR SDKs such as AR CORE or AR KIT and IOS development
* one-two more web developers, we can contribute to html/css and some of us are familiar with .js frameworks
* Two video and image Editors (Photoshop\\Final Cut pro\\ ect) to work on the logo design and the video (FILM MAJORS)

It will be challenging, it might be cumbersome, and it may be a 5- 9 hours/week gig but there will be help and we will work together as a team (as of now we are 5) alongside the mentor-ship of Google developers that will support us throughout the development. 

We will meet three-four times a week, (weekends and one two days of the week), for about 2-4 hours each session. 

if you would like to join, we will be meeting Tuesday at S&amp;E 308 upper floor from 6:00 to 8:00 

and Wednesday at S&amp;E 310 upper floor from 5:30 to 9:30

I am serving on a search committee that is working the way the previous posts described.  The diversity statements were read, and then Zoom interviews were conducted, and eventually a subset of those people will make campus visits.

This did not seem odd to me, and in fact, it worked well.  I do not agree with the other professor who said that it was awful that a prospective professor who limited their statement to something on the order of ,""I will grade without regard to race or gender"" would get a poor score.  Similarly, if I asked a prospective professor, ""What are your near-term or long-term goals,"" I would expect better than an answer of, ""I want to keep breathing.""  Such an answer states the bare minimum and does not indicate any understanding of the multi-faceted aspects of teaching in a diverse state school. 

Diversity and equity are complicated topics.  Fostering student success appropriately involves understanding many things about student situations, abilities, and environments. Similarly, an answer on the order of, ""I care about diversity cuz I are one"" would be rated low.  What are good answers?  There are an unbounded range of them. People can talk about what they have done to make DRC students feel welcomed in class, or how they care about fostering a growth mindset (proven to increase performance in underrepresented groups), or how they like find student-backgrounds to color their willingness to ask for help.  Frankly, the hoops that budding academics have to jump through to show they can pitch their work for publication, funding, and education are way more onerous than this in many, many other areas, and I think someone who can't answer the question of how they support diversity--especially in an engineering discipline--doesn't deserve to teach here.  I don't care how great their navel-gazing is.

Interestingly, for our search, every candidate I talked to was delighted that we were placing an emphasis on diversity--regardless of whether or not they were a member of any recognizable underrepresented group.  A couple of the candidates told us that the statement of that requirement in the job ad--along with UCSC's high rating for social mobility--is what made them want to apply to our school. (These were great candidates, and I would be proud to have them as colleagues.)"

Just talked to a friend who was super upset because strikers surrounded his car, yelled and cursed at him to not cross the picket line, and refused to let him pass onto campus. He had his small children in his car with him, who are now very scared and low key traumatized. Even after strikers could see the kids and he told them he had kids in the car, that he lives in FSH on campus and wants to get them home - strikers still cursed and yelled and wouldn’t let him go. 

I also live in FSH. My kid’s safety and education (driving them to and school off campus) is significantly more important to me than your COLA. Your cola could have been important to me if you didn’t think it was okay to treat FSH families like this. I get that this is not representative of the movement as a whole but it only takes a few out of control strikers to do damage. 

Grow up. Children are children and don’t deserve your crap. Any person who thinks their cause is worth traumatizing children needs to seriously reevaluate their behavior. To do this to children is unacceptable, immature and hurtful. 

That is why I don’t support you anymore. Because you clearly think something like this is okay.

so... what should they do? should they just march for hours being sad and bored and hungry, waiting politely for the light to change, letting cars go through &amp; business continue as usual? how effective would that be? what choice do they have but to be strategic and aggressive? it seems that we’re basically a nonconsensual first wall of defense for admin. striking is the only way for the grad students to be heard which admin probably loves because it makes it so easy to pit grads &amp; undergrads against each other.

Why is it worth it to you? I understand that you want the reality to be different than what it is, but in my experience, the best way to encourage change is to withhold your money. Imagine if grads transferred en masse from UCSC, such that staffing for teaching and research were jeopardized or threatened. The university administrators would be forced to rethink their business model. Unionized labor and labor strikes are not enough to dismantle or rebuild the educational industrial complex. You would need to damage the university’s reputation and discourage new grad students from enrolling, otherwise it will be just like the housing situation where investors and folks looking for vacation homes will continue to drive up the prices.

This level of hands off planning, tunnel vision, and giving abusive people a free moral license to be shitty to strangers is not ok, and it only drives people away from what you want.

The entire fucking protest today had zero self awareness and in a time when poor students should be standing together you decided to harass them because they couldnt line dance in the street with you.

You could have formed a coalition with all other underpaid unions here, especially the nonwhite workers who get treated like shit by both the administration and the students themselves. The UC wouldnt be able to worm out of that one.

That’s 34,614 per 9 months a year at 20 hours a week. Um, hell no? Get another fucking job like a normal human being? Most graduate students only have 1-2 classes a quarter, plus whatever classes they end up teaching as TA’s. I know most undergraduate students work anywhere between 2-3 jobs to support their housing and food costs, just like I do, getting paid FAR LESS than that, at menial, minimum wage jobs, plus taking 3-4 classes a quarter. GET. ANOTHER. JOB. Quit being entitled and expecting the UC to foot the bill for everything for you. I know the housing costs are higher in UC Santa Cruz, but who in the hell gets paid 48 an HOUR, even with a bachelors degree, straight out of college? I’d love to know. 

It’s called a struggle for a reason, and being entitled, white adults isn’t going to get the grad students anywhere, especially throwing the temper tantrum they’ve been throwing. I was more than well aware that housing in Santa Cruz would be ridiculously expensive, and I knew that BEFORE I accepted my acceptance to UC Santa Cruz. I was well aware that most of my paycheck, if not all of it, was gonna end up going to rent. This fight isn’t with the UC, it’s with Santa Cruz county to put rent ceilings on rentals in the area to stop the rising cost of rent from gouging our students. Take it up with the city. 

Additionally, the childish behavior witnessed today by the protesters was astounding, and what I heard happening to other students was even MORE astounding. Slapping and attacking cars? I’m sorry, but what did your parents teach you? That beating on people’s personal property was acceptable? Especially to the very students who make your existence at UC Santa Cruz a possibility? The undergrads fund your pay check. As another thread commented, there’s approximately 2,000,000 dollars of undergraduate money being WASTED because of class cancellations due to the strikes. 

The behavior shown today was ridiculous and inappropriate, and these strikes aren’t doing anything but depleting your undergraduate supporters.

I understand the need to make noise and draw attention to the protest in order to force a response from adminstration. This does not, however, justify the protester actions against their fellow students and community members whose success and well-being are now being directly impacted by strikers. COLA has done a wonderful job of making sure to ask for the support of undergraduates and accomodate any that are hurt by the strike thus far. Today showed an utter failure to uphold that value.

RE: UCSC student code of conduct summons

January 29, 2020 By UAW2865

Monday, January 27, 2019, UCSC graduate students withholding grades were notified that if they do not submit grades by Feb. 2, 2020, they will be subject to discipline under the student code of conduct. Yesterday, UAW President Kavitha Iyengar wrote the following letter to UCSC labor relations in response:

Dear Jennifer,

In the Chancellor’s letter to the UCSC community, sent yesterday, she states: “graduate students who do not submit grades by Feb. 2, 2020, will receive a written disciplinary warning in accordance with the UC/UAW contract. Students alleged to have deleted grades will receive a student conduct summons.

Please note the position of the UAW, which is that any such discipline would be unwarranted. Further, any discipline issued to an individual regarding grades by definition would be an allegation regarding their duties as an employee of the University, as non employees do not issue grades. Therefore, any such discipline would be covered by the UC/UAW 2865 contract and all rights to challenge such discipline will arise from that contract as well. Any reference to a student conduct summons in the context or employment is misplaced and an unlawful effort to subvert the contract and the Union’s and its’ members rights.

Sincerely,
Kavitha Iyengar
President UAW 2865"

Fuck the strike! Fuck other human beings!”

Today is proof that going to a university doesn’t translate to having any knowledge of the world or the humans that live in it who deserve the ability to survive. There are literal homeless graduate students and international students who struggle because they are only allowed to work this insufficiently paying job. Maybe don’t put yourselves as clueless and selfishly uncaring for the suffering of others. Graduate student pay has only risen 3-6% over the last few years while rent has increased by upwards of 50% over the same period. That’s not sustainable, that’s not liveable.

There are 17,517 undergrads paying $13,690 each quarter (in-state tuition so minimum!). This amounts to $239 million/quarter (again, minimun)

There are 1,977 grad students who are requesting 1400 extra/month. Per quarter this is about $4200 and for all grad students this is $37,800/quarter.

That amounts to only .01% of all funds in tuition alone that UCSC is receiving from undergrads. This doesn't include grants and funds from taxes that the UC system receives. 

The money is there, the willingness of the regents to redistribute funds and the willingness of the admin to meet to bargain with strikers is not.

I'm a senior international student from China. As the strike's going on, I find it a good opportunity to talk about something very painful.

A very simple fact: We international students are paying $15,000+ each QUARTER to go to school here. This is because of something called the out-of-state tuition, which amounts to around $10,000 for me currently. So yes, international students are paying 2-3 times the regular tuition.

I understand the purpose of out-of-state tuition is to let local students be prioritized. But what I find painful is:
1. UCSC is aggressively admitting more students, especially international students.
2. With more students paying this ridiculously high amount of tuition, UCSC is still underpaying its own workers.

And I'm not mentioning the other harms of recklessly getting more students. This includes overpopulation and higher rent at the same time. Compared to when I first got here in Santa Cruz 4 years ago, I'm seeing the number of homeless people have skyrocketed. It hurts to witness.

I love diversity. But I hate the university's intention behind the name of diversity. I think this gives us all the more reason to demand COLA. I hope I've got my messages out. I hope maybe someone can publicly speak about it. Because I find very few people here are aware of the facts and trends I just stated.

Finally, I'm not giving out my name, or any proof like my passport, I-20, tuition bill... Just observe, ask international students, look up ""out-of-state tuition""...

Good luck!

The project is based around stock trading automation. I’ve taken some time to get a better idea of how trading on the stock market works, alongside some prototype developments of trading strategies and backtesting, with some positive results. 
    
    I’m at a point, where I think I would rather start developing the actual program with the help of some other people. I don’t know what i’m doing.  I’m a freshmen, I’ve been coding for a few years, mainly Java and Python. I’ve tackled some smaller projects for fun, but nothing to serious. I started looking into stocks out of pure interest and it led to this idea. I’m looking for people who are in the same boat as I am and are interested in this project. I would also like to add that there is potential to make some monetary profit from this project, but this should be by no means the reason you are interested in this project.

    If you have a particular interest or you have some experience in any of the following, you may enjoy this project.
- Web development
- Python data manipulation
- Larger Scale Software design
- Stock market analysis
- I would also like to explore the idea of some sort of content creation(youtube, or etc).

    
    If your also a new CS major, this is a great opportunity to meet others in the major as well. I’m not going to bother with creating some sort of application process.

f2txhe,SC county support,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/f2txhe/sc_county_support/,slugfest01234,1,2020-02-12 08:39:25,11,/r/UCSC/comments/f2txhe/sc_county_support/,NaN,"I don’t know if this has just flown over other peoples heads; but Santa Cruz’s city council support for the cola and repressing the police force is nothing but political?

If they support the strikers, it adds to the idea that the housing crisis is UCSC’s fault, not the counties. It may end up promoting support against the vote that’s about to come up about the recall, which would aid in rent being lowered and more lower income housing being provided, making it accessible to students? 

Rent increases (the *ROOT* of the problem here) are the CITIES fault, not that of the UC. Does the UC need to make more housing? *absolutely*. Is it solely the responsibility of the university to provide housing across the city that’s affordable? *NO*. 

However, is the police presence excessive? Yes. But with a crowd like that, it’s preventative. If they weren’t there, who knows what an angry mob like the strikers will do to prevent students from getting onto campus to complete daily tasks like attending class, which isn’t in our control. Grades come first, and if teachers are holding class, and taking attendance, that’s no ones fault but the teachers. The only thing we can do is go to class because otherwise, we suffer if we don’t. (Or, our grades do. Academic probation or being kicked out *isn’t* an option.)

Do we need riot police? No. But I think at least having campus police present is necessary to ensure the strikers don’t block off all entrances, and to make sure people (individual bad apples) aren’t vandalizing vehicles or hurting people who need to cross the picket line.  

Just my two cents. Call it a conspiracy if you want, but *every* action that both the UC and the city take, have political motivations."

I chose the school because of it’s unique emphasis on undergraduate education, its beautiful location, a forward thinking digital arts program and a Regent’s scholarship.

The housing situation in Santa Cruz has always been a mess for the University and it always will be. Ever see that famous aerial picture of all the VW busses permanently parked in a remote lot functioning at student housing? The geography of Santa Cruz and it’s proximity to SF Bay will always make it unaffordable to live comfortably without wealth. Always. This is baked into the equation.

Anyone expecting to be paid a ‘livable’ wage in Santa Cruz as a student is a fool. You are in the least livable city in the country. Nobody has sympathy for people living in paradise. You have absolutely no leverage in the real world and you are only hurting yourself and other students.

If you want to see what a ‘successful’ student rebellion looks like take a glance at Evergreen State College in Washington. A school’s reputation is the bulk of its value to you. You have almost nothing to gain and everything to lose.

Campus living now looks glamorous compared to when I was there. We only had 1 year of guaranteed housing and there were almost no apartments to speak of. Concrete walls, no adjustable heating/cooling, ants invading every crack left unsealed. And the bathrooms resembled what you’d expect in a refugee camp.

However bad you think it is now, it’s never been any better. You’re not here to make this place your home. You’re here to scrimp and swindle your way through life until you get that degree and move the hell out. It can be a fantastic ride. There is tons of opportunity if you’re creative and have hustle. But wanting to be comfortable as a student is a foolish mistake.

Every day you spend striking is a day of opportunity lost. Trust me these days will go by fast. I look back and realize that there was way more to take advantage of then I bothered to. And I was poor as ever. Brown rice and raw broccoli was my standard meal. Once a week I took the bus to get a $3 Jamba Juice and that was my treat for the week.

Anyway, that’s my take. Feel free to hit me up with questions if you’re interested. 🐌 🐌 🐌"

Here’s my second shot


Hi, over the past few months I’ve been tinkering, researching, and developing some ideas for an interesting project I would like to pursue. The project is based around stock trading automation. I’ve taken some time to get a better idea of how trading on the stock market works, alongside some prototype developments of trading strategies and backtesting, with some positive results. 
    
I’m at a point, where I think I would rather start developing the actual program with the help of some other people. I don’t know what i’m doing.  I’m a freshmen, I’ve been coding for a few years, mainly Java and Python. I’ve tackled some smaller projects for fun, but nothing to serious. I started looking into stocks out of pure interest and it led to this idea. I’m looking for people who are in the same boat as I am and are interested in this project. I would also like to add that there is potential to make some monetary profit from this project, but this should be by no means the reason you are interested in this project.

If you have a particular interest or you have some experience in any of the following, you may enjoy this project.
- Web development
- Python data manipulation
- Larger Scale Software design
- Stock market analysis
- I would also like to explore the idea of some sort of content creation(youtube, or etc).

    
If your also a new CS major, this is a great opportunity to meet others in the major as well. I’m not going to bother with creating some sort of application process. If you are someone who is interested and would like to learn more, just send me a message, tell me a bit about yourself if you want, and I’ll get back to you.

It saddens me to see what is happen at base today to the students, faculty, and supporters of the strike. I really hope that do not see the escalation go up. 

I know a lot of people who want to at least attend one lecture, section, or OH this week since they really need it. 

Call it a cooling off period or a time of reflection. So far, I believe this is necessary for people who really need campus fully open again and to not be fully impacted everyday.  Let us have a period of rest during this crucial time.

I hope we gather more students from different communities like from fam student housing to international students, transfers and veterans and other groups.

But one thing that has been quite prevalent in my short time here is increasing number of protests, which at face value seems like a good thing, people standing up for what they believe in. I guess my gripe with COLA is that it doesn't seem clear what they want and their methods seem to not quite effective. Sorry for my ignorance on the matter, I'm not aware of much that has been going on or the history of the situation. So my inquiries are as follows:
1) what does COLA (the acronym, if it is one) stand for?
2) What does COLA(the purpose behind it) stand for?
3) How much money do the grads currently make? How does this compare to other school? How much do they want(this would probably the answer for 2)? Does their labor deserve more pay, or do they relatively need to get paid more to survive? 
4) How does striking and hindering classes and causing basically a lot of turmoil for undergrads hurt the people in charge? 
5) Are the strikes a form of awareness to get more people involved into a solution or is striking the solution? Because it doesn't seem to be working if it's the latter. 
6) How long has this been going on for, is COLA recent? If it's old then it obviously hasn't worked, so are these approaches different from those in the past? 
7) Will the UC have to raise tuition to compensate the wages? 
8) why don't they put their efforts into hurting the pockets of those in charge ? I.e fight capitalism with capitalism, in turn generating more revenue.(this might be a dumb question, and if it isn't it's probably hard to implement, but I genuinely don't know enough to know if it is bad question or not).
Thank you and I am genuinely trying to understand this from all angles so I can contribute in a meaningful way."

Lots of privileged kids in UCSC who don’t understand that fighting for what poor people have in common is more important than identity politics.


If you want to help poor vulnerable people then vote for a progressive candidate. 


I feel like a lot of the people I interact with from UCSC buy into the anti-bernie spin. Others will only vote for a female candidate. 

I really wish UCSC would put aside reductionist identity politics and focus on class politics. Representation is important. But don’t let that become your sole guideline for elected official's

also, addressing the whole issue of whether it’s a city problem or a ucsc problem, it’s a social issue and is bigger than just how little grad students are getting paid or how expensive rent is. the fact of the matter is that the cost of living has gone up exponentially and wages haven’t matched up. i agree that the city should enforce rent control, but that will take years and lots of votes. should that be one of our collective goals? yes. but let’s also acknowledge that grad students simply aren’t making enough money. 

and yes, there are some people that are part of the protests that aren’t acting as some say they should, but they aren’t representative of the whole. you can’t control what people say, and a lot of the anti-cop sentiment stems from personal experience and frustration at how the police have been acting collectively (ie police brutality and racial profiling). i’m not condoning it, but i just wanted to offer another perspective instead of just “i hate cops”."

The graduate students are asking for a $1500 monthly increase to offset the rent cost, but that is unreasonably large. 

Now, why shouldn’t these grad students be paid more? It’d because they choose to come here, knowing full well the cost of living in Santa Cruz. If they couldn’t afford to live here or attend school here, why even bother coming? There are other UC schools that are cheaper to live at, and if you have dependents you need to support, why are you going to grad school? Grad school is meant to be an investment, where you make more after you get your degree. However, you’re gonna have to live like an undergrad if you’re attending here. You’re not gonna get your own lofty single, but you can definitely live here sharing a double.

UCSC should give them a bit more because it will actually improve how the school is run, but asking for $1500 a month more for the same work as other grads are doing on other UCs."

The basic premise of what happened is as follows:  


1. The Grad Students were paid a livable wage
2. Prices rose
3. The wage is no longer livable  


Yes, there are shady things going on with the funding, but that is not the REASON the wages are no longer livable, they were, presumably, livable at some point, but then due to rising prices, ceased to be livable.  


So, instead of tackling 3., why don't we tackle 2. instead by staging the protest near City Hall for some form of Rent Control? Because the way I see it, if COLA happens, we get this:  


1. The Grad Students were paid a livable wage
2. Prices rose
3. The wage is no longer livable
4. COLA implemented, Grad Students are paid a livable wage
5. Prices rise
6. The wage is no longer livable

I dunno, maybe I'm missing something stupidly obvious, but it seems like we should hit the rising prices of housing before we go for COLA, or else the cycle repeats itself."

It turns out ucsc wanted to build some, but was recently blocked by a couple of environmental groups.

It almost seems to me like they should be protesting the environmental groups for indefinitely delaying additional housing from being built.

[Housing Project](https://ucscstudenthousingwest.org/)
In summary
* the housing project would add apx 3000 more beds.
*March 2019 the UC Regents formally approved the proposed project’s design
*the project has been delayed due to CEQA related litigation being filed

[Here](https://www.cityonahillpress.com/2019/05/10/student-housing-west-faces-two-lawsuits/) is more information regarding the CEQA litigation

And finally this is a link to the [East Meadow Action Committee](https://www.eastmeadowaction.org/) one of the main environmental groups against the proposed housing project.

Furthermore I think that the City of Santa Cruz should be pressured into allowing more development.
Housing prices are high because there is a shortage of housing. Paying people more will exacerbate the issue. Building more housing will decrease the cost of living.

Under california law (penal code 416 PC) two or more persons who do mot disperse when ordered to by a public official, after being given clear orders, may be labeled with a severe misdemeanor.

The right to protest or picket is protected under the first amendment. That much we should all understand; however, there have been two notable court cases that have established limitations under law on what protesters may or may not do. Under  Collins v. Jordan, 110 F.3d 1363, 1367 (9th Cir. 1996) and Papineau v. Parmley, 465 F.3d 46, 56-57 (2d Cir. 2006), restrictions include: obstruction of traffic, businesses, or public sidewalks.

The grads have a right to strike and a good reason (though I may personally disagree with the means and the extent) however their obstruction of the main entrance the effective shutdown of classes (optional attendance, front lawn attendance, or cancelled) is clearly a violation making those arrests, after order and 20 minutes time to comply, legal.

This is a link to the size of UCSC’s endowment fund. https://www.google.com/search?q=ucsc+endowment&amp;rlz=1CDGOYI_enUS763US763&amp;oq=ucsc+endow&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0j69i60l3.3622j1j4&amp;hl=en-US&amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;ie=UTF-8 . 


As you can see the university itself  only has a fraction of the 22 million dollar price tag of your pay increase (1400 a month* 9 months * 1800 graduate students). UCSC’s endowment fund (215 million) is the second smallest endowment fund next to Merced’s ( 55 million ). If we (generously, as in overestimating) assume the endowment fund pays out 6% interest every year that is about 12,900,000. AND if we assume that the university cuts all funding for the other programs and debt payment. The school still needs an extra million dollars EVERY YEAR just to pay for your COLA. 

The school also has about 1 million in cash and HAD probably around 1,700,000 in liabilities (that is until you all decided to protest and the school spent millions on riot police). 

WHERE DO YOU EXPECT TO GET THE MONEY FROM????? UCSC doesn’t have loads of income coming in like other UCs, we have no sports, no real massive donors unlike the other UCs, and we give out the most academic scholarships of any UC. The university TRIED to build housing, it was blocked by environmental groups and people in town who wanted to keep property values high. What do you people want???? I don’t think any employer has ever given a 58% pay increase in history, and I’m willing to bet uc Santa Cruz could care less about you all (no offense, just the truth). Instead of inconveniencing everyone here who just wants an education, please come up with a PLAN that will actually work before trying to meet with the UC. The argument “lOoK hOw bIg yOuR eNdOwMeNt fUnD iS” is not valid. The university can’t just sell all its assets and investments because then it won’t have money in the future to pay for its programs and debts."

The survey is designed to collect student complaints about class and section disruptions. Two things occurred to me when I saw this survey:

1) The university will probably use the information generated from this survey to identify and punish TAs and lecturers who are on strike/standing in solidarity. 

2) The university is portraying the strike as simply an ""inconvenience"" to undergrads and not the complex and necessary struggle that it is. I'm not saying that having your classes canceled isn't annoying, but the fact is that graduate students are in a fight for a wage that will guarantee their basic dignity. The university is trying to turn undergrads against the strike by focusing on the class disruptions.

I think it would be awesome if as many people as possible filled out the top line of the survey, which asks what class was disrupted, with a statement of solidarity, ie ""I support grad students and stand with the COLA strike"", and submitted. We need to let the university know that their divisive tactics will not work and that many of us undergrads are in support of the COLA strike. I posted the link below.

That we are too good to concern ourselves with campus politics or that we somehow all collectively have something against students from other majors. Or even that we get special treatment from the adminstration. What I think a lot of students might not know is that in many ways we are getting the short end of the stick.

The CS major has exploded in the last few years at UCSC (and most other schools) and proportionally funding has not even close to kept up. Our program is short staffed, underfunded, and overflowing. The reality is CS student tuition is a major reason other less-popular majors can even continue to be offered. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that, I get it. Not too long ago, the CS major wasn't too popular itself. Being CS can be rough. How many other majors have had waiting lists that flowed into the 200's? Do you find yourself picking 3 sets of backup classes out because inevitably 1, 2, or even 3+ of your major classes will fill up before you even get the chance to enroll? Some of these classes are offered as little as once a year.

Now I'm not asking for much. Not expecting pity or even appreciation. Just a little less animosity towards CS students, and sure I think it's fair to want less animosity from us as well. We're all getting fucked here one way or another, some of us maybe in ways that are more fun than others. And let's not forget our common ground, most of us have interests that lie outside of majors. Many of us considered alternative majors, probably quite a few would rather be studying whatever you're studying right now. I still wonder what'd it be like to study literature. And if we don't get too involved in things, maybe that's part of same quality that led us to study CS in the first place. Or maybe we're just too stressed and busy. Doesn't have to be more complicated than that. 

Anyway, that's my little rant. Hope y'all are having a good night. Good luck to those with midterms tomorrow. Enjoy the long weekend :)"

&gt;To: UC Santa Cruz Community
From: Janet Napolitano, President, University of California
Subject: An Open Letter to Faculty, Staff and Students at UC Santa Cruz

&gt;Dear Faculty, Staff and Students:

&gt;The University of California respects its labor unions and its unionized workers. They provide valuable services throughout the University, from gardening and food service on our campuses to patient care in our hospitals to lecturers in our classrooms. The obligations between the University and its unions are negotiated and memorialized systemwide in collective bargaining agreements, which must be voted on and ratified by the union membership. With respect to the collective bargaining agreement between the University and Academic Student Employee-Teaching Assistants (TAs) and their union, the United Auto Workers (UAW), the TAs received the following benefits:

&gt;A waiver of tuition, plus a $300 campus fee remission
3% annual wage increases (in line with other University employees)
A child care subsidy of $3,300 per year (unique to TAs)
A one-time signing bonus
A complete remission of any health care premiums
In exchange for these guaranteed benefits, the University received a contractual promise that the TAs would not strike while the collective bargaining agreement was in effect through June 30, 2022.

&gt;Consequently, the wildcat strike by UC Santa Cruz TAs, where a number of TAs have withheld or deleted fall grades and are refusing to teach classes, is unauthorized and in direct violation of the existing collective bargaining agreement. The striking TAs have asked whether the University would either re-open the agreement or negotiate a separate side letter with them to provide a Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) over and above the wage increase already in the agreement to account for the high cost of housing in Santa Cruz.

&gt;The University will not re-open the agreement or negotiate a separate side-letter. To accede to the demands of a group of employees engaged in an unauthorized wildcat strike would undercut the very foundation of an agreement negotiated in good faith by the UAW and ratified by thousands of members across the system.

&gt;We are sympathetic to the high cost of housing in Santa Cruz and the pressure this puts on TAs, but a wildcat strike is not the way to get relief. Chancellor Larive has already proposed two measures to help graduate students: a $2,500 need-based housing fellowship; and for doctoral students a 5-year, funding program at the minimum support level of a 50 percent teaching assistantship. We can work together to persuade our legislators in Sacramento to support the University’s request for more graduate student support. We could also work together to develop other legislative proposals to speed the construction of student housing.  

&gt;However, holding undergraduate grades hostage and refusing to carry out contracted teaching responsibilities is the wrong way to go. Therefore, participation in the wildcat strike will have consequences, up to and including the termination of existing employment at the University.

&gt;It should not come to this. We urge the striking TAs to turn in their grades and return to the classroom. The TAs must honor their side of the bargain, just as the University must honor its commitments. The wildcat strike must come to an end.

&gt;Yours very truly,

&gt;Janet Napolitano
&gt;President

1. Because campus isn’t fully closed, people never know how hard it’s going to be to get on campus, which is an inconvenience. As a result, most people are able to get through so they have class and count the midterms, but a few people inevitably get screwed. Consequently, some of those who were previously sympathetic with the strikers change their minds.

2. The protests blocking the intersection at the base of campus give the admins a reasonably strong legal (not moral) justification for hiring police in military gear from somewhere else to come in and beat up and arrest and suspend the students who are protesting which I think is disgusting to pretty much everyone whether u support the strike or not.

Today, we all got an announcement saying there were pedestrians in the roadway, and soon after, another message saying cops closed intersection at the base of campus. 
That makes me think that it might be a better strategy for some protestors to walk in a dispersed distribution around Hagar and Coolidge, occasionally jaywalking at random. The sidewalk between Opers and the base of campus is too long to police effectively, and no one is going to get suspended for jaywalking.

 If the cops have to follow a protocol to close campus whenever there’s perceived danger of pedestrians in the roadway, they will have to close the East Entrance to campus, and if they look like they are going to re-open it, protestors could just do it again, inducing the cops to do the intersection blocking for them at will. If this would work, just maybe some of the goonery of the out of town cops being biased in and “following orders” could be redirected towards hacking their protocols to strikers’ benefit.

Also, even though I support the strike, I don’t want to see it continue for months like it seems the admins are comfortable doing. As an undergrad, I would personally rather see the graduate students stop this half-assed strike and completely block both East and West entrances indefinitely, stopping all classes until they reach an agreement. If the strike leaders are really going to take back “our campus” they should organize an actual reputable shuttle system to transport the residents and who have a legit reason other than class to be crossing the picket. A college that won’t pay its TA’s enough shouldn’t have them, and a college that doesn’t have TA’s because they’re on strike shouldn’t be able to run it’s classes on the side. If classes stop, the UC would have to come to the table, but the IMO the strike has to actually have a different, more aggressive strategy this time to achieve different results and win something substantial.

Now that I’ve exhausted all my energy my reading and writing about the strike all day, I’m going to start studying for the classes which I hope will be cancelled on Tuesday.

Peace.

Ps. Why don’t you guys cover something that fits tight to your wrist, like a watch, with some kind of a cut-resistant material that behaves like a fabric. The trick is to have an opening in the fabric where the tightening device is for the watch. Then, through two sets of smaller holes on either side of the opening that u can connect up, you could master lock the opening in the fabric shut (to prevent tampering) at the same time as locking the watch on your wrist to the watch on someone else’s. With a cheap combination lock, this would make it ridiculously hard for the police to arrest anyone in those sitting circles. Then, u could dictate the combination when the strike is over and gain access to the tightening device, you could then release, allowing you to pull the fabric, which needs to be looser, over your hand.

&lt;rant&gt;

Peace again."

So basically the livestream of their assembly was a bunch of different unofficial campus groups coming together with the idea that if they unite, then they’re stronger and the UC can’t just push them away as a nuisance. I think this makes a lot of sense for some groups, like BSU and the Snail movement (a group wanting to ensure safe overnight parking for students living in their cars). Hence the “coalition” part of their name.

However, probably due to the gung-ho ambiance around the COLA campaign, the problem is they’re not being particularly picky with which groups are allowed into the coalition. This is why there’s that list of insane demands going around. 

I think overall it makes the whole COLA movement look very cheap......with COLA, the TAs actually have labor to withhold— they actually have a semblance of bargaining power. I don’t think these undergrads like, realize, that......they just see a protest and think it’s empowering etc. Which it is, but there’s still legitimate labour/political theory behind the idea of a strike or movement which isn’t in line with their movement whether they’ve read it or not. 

They really just don’t have any bargaining power. An “attendance strike” (which I don’t think they’re calling for yet, but I’ve heard it floating around) is quite literally just shooting yourself in the foot.....like tuition was already paid lol. The only type of strike I could see having any legitimacy is the idea of turning dorms into co-ops, but even then you can’t withhold rent and form a tenants union because if you don’t pay rent they just put a hold on your account and you can’t take classes.

So yeah.......hopefully this helps explain to people what the Peoples Coalition is and it’s just some kinda word vomit from my brain. Knowing reddit I’m assuming you guys feel kinda the same but yeah I’m interested to hear what everyone thinks. Honestly I think if COLA wants to stay somewhat legitimate, they need to really take a mentor ship role with the Peoples Coalition and help them narrow down demands to things that are actually legitimate and doable, OR they need to denounce their support of the People’s Coalition in general, or else the whole movement is just going to become very cheap and laughable, very fast. And I say this as someone who has been very supportive and involved in COLA........the Peoples Coalition has really turned me off to the whole thing."

&lt;I hate being a student at UC Santa Cruz because it has a virtually 0 national sports scene.
&gt;I love being a student at UC Santa Cruz because of very unique loop bus transportation system. Whether it is your professor, friend from class, or some someone you think is cute, virtually everyone gets on a loop sometime, so who knows who you'll bump into.
&lt; I hate being a student at UC Santa Cruz because of the lack of an effective transportation and parking system,that is due to incompetent admin overenrolling students. 
&gt;I love being a student at UC Santa Cruz because of the beautiful nature that surrounds Santa Cruz. The chill and relaxed vibes here are a nice break from the upbeat and competitive paced vibes that I get from L.A. 
&lt;I hate being a student at UC Santa Cruz because of the very limited nightlife downtown has. A handful of bars and restaurants that close at 8 p.m might have been enough for the 1960's , but in 2020 it is a joke compared to places like UCSB.
&gt; I love being a student at UC Santa Cruz because at my most desperate time, Slug Support came in clutch. My summer housing plans fell through a day before I had to move out of my on campus apartment. I would have been for the first time in my life, homeless if it weren't for the wonderful people at Slug Support who set me up with immediate, temporary  housing.
&lt; I hate being a student at UC Santa Cruz because I am reminded, whether passive or active, constantly of the privilege that some students here have. As a first gen student who is struggling to make ends meet, it is very disheartening when I overhear insensitive comments some fellow students make.
&gt; I love being a student at UC Santa Cruz because I appreciate and am proud of  the rich activist history this university is assiociated with. 
&lt; I hate being a student at UC Santa Cruz because of the lack of fundamental infastructure that is needed for a university the size of UC Santa Cruz.
&gt; I love being a student at UC Santa Cruz because at every job I've worked on campus, I have seen and met good people in every department.(Ex. Loop Bus drivers)
&lt; AND FINALLY, I hate being a student at UC Santa Cruz especially after this week, a week that I believe brought the worst out of everyone. Students being arrested and cited for protesting should not have happened. Further, UC President Janet should not have intimidated UCSC grads students with the email sent out yesterday.

I think it's time for a change in strategy though.

Think about what to do if the strike continues much longer from the perspective of the UC . They have 9 campus (including UCSF). Only one is on strike. Yes, movements are building on other campuses, but  they're not yet actually built. Also, they are a public institution - their funding is determined largely by the state senate. It's not like the UC is sitting on piles of unallocated money - budgets are not fluid documents. So, the UC can either pay massive legal fees and a COLA with money they don't have yet, or they can fire the troublemakers. From their perspective the choice must be obvious.

In my opinion, the strikers should declare victory and stop now. They successfully brought the university to its knees for an entire week. It's been a successful proof of concept. They should keep their jobs and start working with other campuses to really build movements. The simple fact is they CAN and likely will fire a hundreds of grad students from one campus,  but they CAN'T fire THOUSANDS of grad students from ALL the campuses. If they come back in a few months with an actual grassroots organization participating in massive strikes on every campus, they might actually get that side letter they want.

They won this battle - it would be foolish to try and fight the entire war now."

I have way too much on my plate so do massive research into this issue. I have a few thoughts however and a few suggestions with the hope this might help move this along more efficiently.

Are TAs UC wide striking? If not, why not? 
For the purpose of unity and fairness, are other universities with significant funding willing to donate a portion of it to underfunded ones, ahem Berkeley?

Why don’t any of the strikers go on Channel 2 or Kron 4 do an interview and present their case? Pull up publicly available information and show that money is available for a cola, for the sake of transparency. It would do a lot more to gain public sympathy.

Since this is fundamentally a housing issue, and the root cause/problem is the city itself. Why don’t all TAs demand Governor Newsom to do something about it? All this random money is appearing out of thin air to support undocumented and homeless populations. Since this is a public university what’s stopping him from declaring eminent domain and authorizing building housing?

**Argument For COLA:**

Education is a positive externality, meaning that everyone in society will benefit from a well-educated society regardless of if they themselves are educated.The graduate student here are among the leading discoverers and innovators of the world. Therefore, it would be in our collective interest to provide a cost-of-living-adjustment so that our graduate students can continue to provide the discoveries and innovations necessary to improve and advance society.

The TA wage at $23~/hr for 20 hours per week is all the money that grad students receive. However, grad students have to do a lot of work: teaching; research, lab/fieldwork; dissertation writing; grant applications; and various service commitments. The sum total of this work is easily over 40 hours per week, and none of this is optional. In order to fund this labor, grad students are compensated by their departments through their TAships. (Of, if they are lucky they get grants for approximately the same amount that let them avoid teaching). This wage was designed to cover their cost of living for an entire year, which is why they are not allowed to work overtime or additional hours a TA, and outside employment is restricted. 

We have been hired by the UC to do a job: produce rigorous research and provide an excellent education. Managing UC and state finances is not the job of graduate students. In fact, the people who the UC hired to fundraiser and manage money are the very administrators that persistently refuse to pay us a livable wage: enough to live here and do the job they brought us here to do. So, we respond to this question with a demand to administration: do your job and find the money for a COLA, and fast. That being said, we do think it is important to note that we live in the 5th largest economy in the world, and the UC is a state institution. There is undoubtedly money for a COLA.

The $300,000 per day the administration is spending on police to intimidate the protesters would be better spent actually investing in a cost-of-living-adjustment and/or other resources for students.


Graduate students struggling to survive is not only morally wrong, it will lead to the demise of UCSC's quality in research.


***
**Argument Against COLA:**

No it won't.

It just won't. None of that should happen.

You're getting worked up over nothing. Everything is fine. So just relax, okay? You're really overreacting.


&gt; it would be in our collective interest to provide a cost-of-living-adjustment so that our graduate students can continue to provide the discoveries and innovations necessary to improve and advance society.

You are completely wrong. I'm an undergraduate who has been scraping by with the food pantry and section 8 housing. Did anyone help me out? No. I was forced to suffer, so everyone else should.

&gt; Grad students have to do a lot of work... The sum total of this work is easily over 40 hours per week.

Not really.

&gt; Grad students are not allowed to work overtime or additional hours, and outside employment is restricted.  

I don't support graduate student because they are illegally breaching their contract with the university by protesting. Not being paid enough? Breach your contract and get another job.

&gt; There is undoubtedly money for a COLA.

Sorry, no, I disagree.



Why do you keep saying these things? I can tell when something's worng, and I really don’t sense that right now. We’re in control of this situation, and we know what we’re doing. So stop being so pessimistic.
Look, you’ve been proven wrong, so stop talking. You’ve had your say already. Be quiet, okay? Everything’s fine.

You're wrong.

\*\*\*\*Please Forward Widely\*\*\*\*

Dear Colleagues,   


We  write to share our concern over the two recent communications (“An Open  Letter to Faculty, Staff and Students at UC Santa Cruz” from President  Napolitano and “Graduate Student Strike Update” from iCP/EVC Kletzer,  both dated February 14th) that threaten to dismiss Teaching Assistants  who have not submitted Fall grades by February 21st from their Spring  2020 appointments. These two letters raise serious questions about the  future of our campus. We cannot deliver high-quality undergraduate  education without the face-to-face learning and evaluation provided by  the talented and committed graduate student teachers who are themselves  vital to UCSC’s nationally and internationally recognized doctoral  programs and to our status as a research university.  The proposed EVC  response to fall grades and the wildcat strike runs directly counter to  our values and purpose.    


The administration’s proposed action  will cause deep and lasting harm to both undergraduate and graduate  education at UCSC (well beyond the disruption currently caused by the  Teaching Assistants’ strike). In this time of increasing enrollment  pressure at the undergraduate level and the necessity for large classes  (as well as small research-oriented seminars), faculty cannot mount a  quality curriculum that serves undergraduates without the indispensable  pedagogical support of graduate student labor. Over the last few years,  TAs in nearly every graduate program on campus have received enhanced  field-specific training founded in research on effective and inclusive  teaching. As a result, TAs have made immeasurable contributions toward   closing the equity gaps and ensuring success for an increasingly  diverse undergraduate student body.   


In addition to damaging  undergraduate education, the proposed punitive actions will also  severely erode, if not permanently damage, the doctoral mission of the  University of California.  UCSC has been on a strong trajectory of  doctoral growth and it boasts a diverse and robust set of programs. All  of them stand to suffer as a result of the proposed actions.  Striking  graduate students have already been negatively impacted by their rent  burden and low wages; to dismiss them from their Spring 2020 positions  only compounds the financial reasons that led to the wildcat strike in  the first place. We fear that many graduate students will simply be  unable to continue their education as a result. This year’s cohort of  prospective graduate students may also be reluctant to accept offers,  causing further damage to individual departments, undergraduate  curricula, and UCSC’s strong and growing reputation as a major research  university.    


As faculty, we are further concerned that the  proposed measures constitute an infringement of the principle of shared  governance, which grants Senate faculty the right to oversee curriculum  and courses of study. Regents Standing Order 105.2 states: “The Academic  Senate shall authorize and supervise all courses and curricula.”  The  action threatened by the administration would have profound effects on  our courses and curricula, constituting a change in the delivery of  instruction. As such, it is not a step that should be taken without  thoughtful and extensive Senate consultation and consent.   
 

Graduate  students, with the support of undergraduates, lecturers, staff, and  faculty, have drawn attention to a long-standing problem. The current  crisis offers us an extraordinary opportunity to come together as a  community to reimagine the future of UCSC and, through honest and frank  dialogue, construct the paths that will return UCSC to its place as an  institution dedicated to knowledge in the service of social  transformation.   


It is our belief that even faculty who do not  support the strikers and their tactics ought to be deeply concerned  about the implications of these letters for the quality of education on  this campus. We hope you will join us in insisting on faculty  consultation and shared governance in this matter. We also invite you to  affirm the critical importance of graduate Teaching Assistants to the  educational mission of the University of California and to urge  systemwide and local campus accountability, compassion, and creative  problem-solving.  


We hope you will attend the Academic Senate  Meeting on Wednesday, February 19, to raise some of these concerns with  campus leadership.  


Sincerely,   


The Faculty Organizing Group (FOG)"

I'm a 3rd year engineering student who, by virtue of enormous social anxiety and my introverted / shy boi personality has not managed to find a relationship so far at UCSC :(

Thankfully I have a few close friends who normally help keep me grounded, but sometimes when the academic/mental stress gets too much I start spiraling into intense loneliness, anxiety and depression. This quarter in particular for some reason I've felt especially alone, and I don't want to just keep going on feeling more and more emotionally isolated. 

I'm part of a few clubs, but I don't even have any particularly close female acquaintances (pretty pathetic, I know). I guess at this point I'm sort of at a loss for how I would even start looking for a s/o; would appreciate any advice. For reference, I'd say I'm not particularly attractive nor unattractive, and some of the stuff I'm into are video games, pretty much any sort of outdoorsy thing, electronic music, physics/philosophy/deep conversations and animals (cats).

I know two main issues are my crippling lack of self-confidence and I'm also really paranoid about making people feel uncomfortable and/or thinking I'm a creep or something, so I almost never approach people.

Finally, to any of my fellow lonely slugs out there, I feel you; it all will be okay, just keep moving forward one moment at a time :) You always matter, even if you don't always feel like you do. Hang in there y'all

Thanks for listening to my scattered ramblings slugs, hope you're all having a nice day

I don’t understand why undergrads are supporting the strike either. If they do get their $1,500 per month raise, it’s going to cost the university potentially millions of dollars by the end of the year. The next logical step for the university is that they increase tuition on undergrads to subsidize the COLA. Grad students don’t care because they’re graduating in less then two years anyways. 
What COLA should be doing instead is taking the protests to City Hall. They should be pushing for more renter friendly policies like rent control. It’s not the university’s fault that rent in Santa Cruz is expensive because the wages were already agreed upon and set by the other campuses. 
The media attention has made UCSC and the protestors a complete embarrassment. It makes our school look dysfunctional. We pay a lot of money to study here and we are supposed to get a quality education. The protests have hindered this transaction significantly."

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

Re: Academic Council Statements on the UCSC Graduate Students’ Strike and Police Presence at UCSC

Dear Janet,

The Academic Council has approved the following statements concerning the graduate students’ strike at UC Santa Cruz and the associated police presence in response to the strike. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have additional questions.

Statement on UCSC Graduate Students’ Strike

The Academic Council of the University of California wishes to express its deep concern over the trajectory of the labor conflict at UC Santa Cruz and its hope that both sides will strive to achieve a just resolution of their differences. In a public statement, UCSC graduate students have offered, without requiring a reason, to enter the grades of any undergraduate student who requests it, which demonstrates the graduate students’ strong sense of responsibility and support for the undergraduate mission of the University of California. In further achieving a resolution several principles must be acknowledged:

1) Doctoral funding and support are complex issues.

2) The success of UC’s undergraduate and graduate missions are inseparable. If graduate education is not flourishing, undergraduate education cannot flourish either.

3) Graduate students cannot be expected to fulfill either their learning or teaching responsibilities when they face significant housing and food insecurity. The University should be committed to providing adequate housing and food security in concrete ways to its doctoral students.

4) The University should refrain from punitive action against graduate students during the strike and from retaliation against them once the strike has been concluded. The preservation of high quality graduate and undergraduate programs demands no less.

With the wildcat strike having brought attention to the significant challenges facing graduate student employees, Council believes that the best way forward includes both sides working together through the collective bargaining process to address the legitimate demands of graduate students regarding food and housing insecurity.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Statement on Police Presence at UCSC

The Academic Council of the University of California is distressed over the UC administration’s deployment of an armed police presence in response to the peaceful student protest and strike at UC Santa Cruz. Numerous national journalistic accounts and personal testimonies (including in-person video recordings) from students, staff, and faculty at UCSC describe a climate of fear, violence, and hostility that has been created by militarized, riot gear-wearing police officers, including non-UC police who have little familiarity with our students or the long history of campus protest in the UC system. This police presence disturbingly echoes recent and historical examples of police force at the University of California that must not be repeated.

The Academic Council supports more than 200 faculty at UCSC who are calling on the UC and UCSC administrations to:

1) Substantially roll back the police presence at the UCSC student strike, which is addressing urgent issues of financial, food, and housing insecurity. There is no reason for 50-70 police officers to engage in shows of force against students involved in peaceful demonstration.

2) Demilitarize the police presence at UCSC, which has thus far had the effect of intimidating peacefully demonstrating students with implicit and explicit threats of violence; this armed police presence has multiple adverse effects on the teaching mission of the university, including the classroom work undertaken by graduate students, Senate faculty, and contingent faculty.

Academic Council supports the principles of debate, engagement, and collaborative/consultative problem solving in approaching the difficult issues raised by the UCSC student strike and protest. The escalated police presence on the campus does not serve the shared objective of reaching an outcome that best serves the needs of all our students and fulfills the mission of the University of California.

As noted in the Edley-Robinson report, “Our University is charged by the State of California with the profound responsibility of educating its sons and daughters. Its policies at every level must reflect that core educational mission. This is particularly true when it comes to protest and civil disobedience—activities that frequently will advance the University’s educational mission by allowing students to become active, engaged, and responsible citizens, and to express cutting-edge ideas. We must view civil disobedience by protesters through the lens of the core values of our institution.”

Sincerely,

Kum-Kum Bhavnani, Chair

Academic Council

DOOMSDAY RALLY THIS FRIDAY 11AM AT THE QUARRY!!!,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/f6r6v7/stand_up_to_napolitanos_threats_and_stand_in/,Last_Clone_Of_Agnew,1,2020-02-20 02:29:21,10,/r/UCSC/comments/f6r6v7/stand_up_to_napolitanos_threats_and_stand_in/,NaN,"Full transcript of the email sent out by Stefan Yong:

&gt;The doomsday clock is close to midnight. Janet Napolitano has spoken. If wildcat strikers do not submit grades and cease their strike activities by 11:59pm on Friday, February 21, over 200 graduate student workers risk being fired en masse by the UC.   
&gt;  
&gt;**The time to show up is now. The Undergrads for COLA Doomsday Rally and March is this Friday in the Quarry Plaza at 11am.**   
&gt;  
&gt;If carried out, the consequences of this mass firing will be severe. For many strikers, it would spell the end of academic careers at UCSC. For the many international grad students on strike, this means de facto deportation from the United States. The sudden absence of hundreds of TAs from campus will drastically limit the ability of academic departments to offer classes, impairing the ability of many to graduate. Undergraduate education, especially in the Humanities, the Social Sciences, and the Arts, is likely to take a historically unprecedented hit. Contrary to the administration’s claims that they have your safety and well-being in mind, they propose sacking hundreds of graduate students—those who most closely mentor and supervise undergraduate academic work conducted at UCSC.  
&gt;  
&gt;**This Friday, we need your solidarity and your collective strength more than ever.** Rally with us on Doomsday in the Quarry. March with us to the base of campus, where we will be joined by contingents from other rallies on campus—Faculty for COLA, STEM for COLA, Lecturers for COLA, and the many autonomous groups of students and workers springing up daily.    
&gt;  
&gt;Solidarity will ripple across the UC system as the strike spreads. Our rally coincides with rallies and pickets planned at UC Davis, UCLA, UC Riverside, and UC Santa Barbara.   
&gt;  
&gt;Beyond the UC, many thousands of workers, students, professors, members of the national media, the City Council of Santa Cruz, and a U.S. presidential candidate have thrown their support behind our movement. **Which side will you be on when the clock strikes?**  
&gt;  
&gt;Undergrads for COLA! Solidarity forever!

Yong said it better than I'd ever be able to. Convince everyone to come out and support! Show the administration that we WILL NOT be stopped by threats of expulsion. We have the support of other campuses and even presidential candidate Bernie Sanders made an official tweet expressing his support for COLA. Let's do this!!!

They are local homies from Salinas, CA, with a dope Cumbia Urbana sound. They've toured with the late Celso Piña (RIP). It being at Moe's Alley you'll have good local presence, as well as out of towners (specially for the cumbia shows).

If you're looking for new (cultural/sound) experiences this is a good opp. Even if you go loner, I've seen plenty of single people vibe with it, and have a blast dancing(not difficult to find dance partner), or even just enjoy Cumbia.

I am at this university to learn, to take my classes and get my degree. I’m not here to be the tool of the graduate student’s agenda. I’m NOT okay with my grades being withheld, I’m NOT okay with classes being canceled, I’m NOT okay with my access to going on and off campus by bus being restricted, and I am DONE being told to shut up and support COLA.

COLA is a shortsighted movement that has no plan as to where their funds will come from. The movement had refused to bargain, it has refused to consider those they are hurting. When someone stands up and says “please stop I need to go to classes” the graduate students send back hate instead of intelligent discourse and acknowledgement that their actions are harming some of the undergrads. I refuse stand with this movement. I refuse to stand with those who will not understand that their actions are hurting others. The only one I stand with is me, and my education.

I am not a pawn, I am not a tool. The COLA movement needs to stop using undergraduates. The strike needs to end. I’m sick of not knowing when or if I will have my classes. Classes that I am going into mountains of debt for. I’m sick of being told to be silent."

Apologies if its unorganized in terms of context or not giving more info, I'm just throwing my thoughts out there. A little background first:

I moved to the US back in October 2016 from another country and I didn't know anything about the education system or any basic information about the US, I didn't even know what a UC was. Ever since i moved here, it been one struggle after another, from getting bullied for being uncultured, to making fake ""friends"" that simply used me and forgot about me like I never met them before and just simply adjusting to a new country. A lot was riding on my shoulder in terms of expectations from everyone, such as getting into a 4 year uni from a CC, getting a part time job, getting an internship, to just simply getting a driver's license. 

Now, being at UCSC, the rent at SC is extremely high and so I've been commuting to UCSC from Milpitas (north of San Jose) since Fall 2018 and i've commuting 5 days a week ever since because of my schedule and this has taken a severe toll on me. Also, it's been hell of a struggle from adjust to the quarter system, the toughness of classes, and being surrounded by a plethora of people in class and just in general. I thought i made one good friend here, but i was used, and forgotten after that person met other people who got him/her into party's and hooking up with alcohol etc and and completely forgot about me, this exact has happened before before coming to ucsc and everytime it's been heartbreaking. I don't drink or smoke because I've made a promise to myself that I'll keep myself clean for as long as i live and keep myself healthy and this made it difficult in making friends as the majority like to do that and i don't have that in common with them. I tried clubs on campus, but its all very cliquey. 

I've been applying to internships for the past 8 months and with no luck, i got rejected in a lot of interviews for being inexperienced or just completely failing their challenges and i've always tried to improve myself and my resume, but i kept on failing. Where one interviewer thought he hung up the phone, but i heard him say, ""is this guy even a CS student? what a waste"". That broke my heart and made me lose hope. Especially since all these internships require practical experience with technologies that you can get only if you work there.

From fake friendships, general struggle to adjusting to a new country, the toll of commuting and internship hunting failure has led me to severe depression and an increase in social anxiety. I've been working very hard in all aspects ever since i stepped foot in the US, but the beatings i take have been very severe and i just can't take it anymore, I barely get sleep because of all the stress and worries. I'm literally on the verge of giving up....

if you read till here, thank you for taking out the time in reading my struggle"

(While also seeing that UCSCs attempts to build more grad housing are being stopped by many of the same people who support the strike—but I am skipping ahead.) I also sympathize with our junior faculty, our undergraduates and our staff.  These are my opinions and thoughts. I think I’ve been a coward by not speaking up until now, honestly.  I let a desire to keep out of the mess—a desire to have pleasant relations with my colleagues and students—keep me from speaking what I see as my truth. 

What I said at the Senate meeting, roughly:

- Undergraduates are being hurt (I’ve talked to many). If you read some of the recent deleted posts, you know this is true.  They didn’t sign up for this, they were not asked their opinion, and when they object, they are ridiculed and attacked.

- I have staff reporting to me who make less than the graduate students and won’t be leaving UCSC in a couple of years with a shiny new degree that changes their income. There is no reason the grad students deserve more than the other sets of folks. This is a stage of the grad students’ educations. In response to this, at the Senate meeting, the faculty and students kept saying things like, “then pay everyone more.” Right.  And maybe we should give everyone a pet unicorn, too. UCSC is poor, and following this recent circus, it is a good deal poorer. This nonsense makes us look *less* deserving at UCOP, not more.

- I respect Civil Disobedience a great deal.  Civil Disobedience includes enduring the consequences of said Disobedience. People should realize that if they don’t do their jobs, they don’t get to keep their jobs.  I support failing to reappoint the grade withholders, 100%.

-I think Chancellor Larive and Provost Kletzer have incredibly difficult jobs (for which they are appropriately—not outrageously—compensated), and I can’t imagine trying to balance all the pressures they are dealing with and trying to find solutions.  While I don’t agree with everything they have ever done in this arena, I appreciate them for doing their jobs.  In particular, I appreciate their trying to work for undergraduates against the groupthink of the bulk of the faculty.  I have had so many people tell me that I was “brave” for saying what I did at the Senate meeting.  Brave! For honestly stating (against the clear tone of the room) that I support undergrads and want to hold grad students responsible for not fulfilling their duties!  I’ve had so many people tell me that they in essence feel bullied to agree with the bulk of the faculty statements in support of the students.  I’ve had other faculty straight up tell me that they need grad students to like them, so the “have to” support the strike—even though they agree that their actions are improper and damaging. (I think more undergrads should thank the Chancellor and the Provosts for weathering the storm and pushing for them.)

And finally, yes, I voted for Bernie and will again,  and I don’t give a toss that he supports the strike.  I’m pretty convinced that *I* would support the strike if I didn’t know what I know about it.  I don’t think Bernie would say he supports the strike either if he got to talk to some of the students who are not just being inconvenienced—they are being straight up damaged. Let him talk to all the people.  See what he says then.

I love and respect many grad students. But I don’t like the mob of the strikers—not one bit."
f7d40s,Misconceptions and Questions About the Strike and Grad Programs,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/f7d40s/misconceptions_and_questions_about_the_strike_and/,UCSCgradStriker,1,2020-02-21 07:59:01,50,/r/UCSC/comments/f7d40s/misconceptions_and_questions_about_the_strike_and/,NaN,"Here's some information about common misconceptions, questions, and arguments I've been seeing about graduate student strikers.  Feel free to share or copy/paste as you like.  In general, more work needs to be done to demystify how graduate programs work, especially PhD programs.  I'm sure grad students in the comments are happy to answer questions for folks who are considering grad programs, or you can stop by base if you'd like to chat with us in person.  

Graduate TAs only work for 20 hours a week.

* It's true that graduate teaching assistants are compensated for 20 hours of work per week, but these appointments are granted with the understanding that graduate students also do research work that we're not explicitly paid for. If we don't complete this work, we can't make progress to complete our programs and we won't be employable after graduation. Ultimately, doctoral students are brought into the university to do research, and are told to make research their priority. This research work helps UCSC maintain its Research I status (universities with the highest level of research activity), and helps the community by advancing our understanding of the world. Almost all graduate students work at least 40 hours per week, and most work far more than that.

It sounds like UCSC graduate students make a lot, actually.

* Santa Cruz is in a housing crisis, and local rents are exorbitantly high.  Even on-campus graduate housing costs $1211 per month, leaving grads in this housing (only 82 beds) paying at least 55% of their salary toward rent, which qualifies as severe rent burden. Those who have to pay campus fees and are not offered summer appointments can pay up to 77% of their salary toward rent in on-campus housing.

UCSC graduate workers agreed to a contract so they shouldn't be on strike.

* The vast majority of UCSC graduate students (83%) voted ""NO"" on the current contract.

Why don't UCSC grad students just go work somewhere else?

* Graduate students aren't working in a typical situation. Leaving our jobs means leaving years of progress towards our degrees behind. Please understand why this is a big and, for most of us, unreasonable ask.

Why accept an offer at a grad program where the cost of living is so high?

* Not all of us were lucky enough to have many options for graduate programs.  Many of us could only conduct the research we are by collaborating with our particular faculty advisor, or with units on UCSC campus like the Long Marine Lab.  Many of us belong to departments that don't exist at every university, like History of Consciousness.  Also, graduate programs shouldn't just be accessible for those who can independently afford to live in an area with high rents.

Graduate students are paid well because they get tuition remission. 

* The majority of doctoral students don't take classes beyond their second year, and all doctoral students paid tuition for their undergraduate educations one way or another.  It's very uncommon for PhD students to pay tuition, since students would effectively be paying the university to do research labor which benefits the university.  UCSC is not offering graduate workers a good deal by offering tuition remission; this is standard practice for almost all PhD programs."

1. Why did you repeatedly lie to us when you said undergrads would not be hurt during the beginning of the strike?
2. Why do you feel that the graduate students struggle is more important than that of the undergrads who are in a more disadvantageous position than you?
3. Where will the funding for your handout come from?
4. How are we expected to believe you wont accept an offer that raises our tuition (which you dont have to pay for) or cut the funding of programs and amenities that benefit undergrads?
5. Why did you not ever consider a way of protesting that doesnt hurt undergrads, and why do you continue to hurt undergrads despite us making it repeatedly known that we are the only ones being negatively affected by this sham of a strike.
6. How do you respond to the fact that this strike disproportionately affects underprivileged and POC students? I personally rely on several scholarships and loans to be here. I lost out on $1,0000 in scholarships because my TA refused to answer my emails after withholding my grades, significantly straining my financial stability.

To find some relief/answers I have emailed my professor multiple times over these two weeks with several questions regarding concerns I have about my grade and the future of the class as a result of the strike. I unfortunately have not received responses to any of them, and I am unable to meet with her personally as she has not been on campus this whole time. She has also been doing a poor job at communicating the expectations of the class (regarding how we will receive class and section participation points without being on campus) that has left me very confused.

The only other thing I can think to do is message her through canvas, but based on the results I've gotten so far, it seems unlikely that I would get a response. Has anyone else been dealing with this problem that had success in contacting professors through other means? Any ideas are greatly appreciated, I am at a loss for what to do..."

Here's my two cents on why we need this. I post this on Reddit and not the facebook group because I want people outside UCSC to see this.  


To start off, I'm a first year CS PhD, I'm an international student, and I can probably make ends meet without a COLA. Why so? Because:  
(a) I had the fortune of going to a very good school for what is in the US, nothing, and paid a total of about *$1000 across 4 years* in tuition, and got paid a scholarship of about $5000 that took care of both tuition and room and board and left me money to spare. In short: no college debt. Crazy, right?  
(b) My dad gave me a considerable sum of money, no strings attached, to help me move in and that gives me a cushion to rest on if by chance I do not have the money to make ends meet. Without this, I would not have been able to pay the $3.5k deposit for my place, or the $1200 in rent I pay for the first three months before I got my first paycheck.   
(c) I'm in CS, which means that with some effort, I can get an internship in the valley if I want, where I would make in 3 months close to what I make in the remaining 9 at UCSC.  
(d) My advisor is very helpful, and assumes that people staying back at UCSC over the summer will be employed by the university at 100%, and he does this for people who stay back on a GSR to the best of my knowledge.   
(e) I came into this PhD at 22, fresh out of college, and have no dependents that I need to provide for.  


Also, clarification. I'm a TA this quarter, I am not striking, and to the best of my knowledge, our department's representatives have officially asked us to not strike. I enjoy teaching, and because I'm TAing for a lower division class, it doesn't require a lot of preparation on my part because this is stuff I have been dealing with on a regular basis since high school. I make efforts to help students outside of regular hours and I've so far had decent feedback, so I'm probably doing an ok job. Moreover, as an international, I have other fears which I can assure you are non-trivial. I still visit the picket line from time to time and sign pledges sent out in support, but I am low key ashamed that I'm letting others fight the fight I should be fighting.   


My support for the COLA strike is not personal. Honestly, I am sure that given my privilege I could continue to live a semi-decent life here as a grad, although I guess people in the US might tend to disagree, given that I don't have a car, don't go out, rarely eat out, and don't intend to go home in the near future. Maybe with a well-paying internship, I could afford to do some of these.   


The fight for a COLA is extremely important for the non-STEM departments. STEM, especially engineering, has the advantage of being better off, combined with a high international student population that makes them hesitant to take part. In an age where knowledge for the sake of knowledge is becoming harder and harder to pursue, this sends out an absolutely horrible message. It essentially tells the humanities and social sciences this: ""Ok you can die because there is no immediate application for your work"". It also sends out the veiled message that the labour of non-STEM students is less valuable than that of those in STEM. Is this the hill we want to die on?   


What is funny is that CS today stands on the shoulders of 20th century philosophy and mathematics. As my friend u/veedotc, a second year CS PhD reminded me, a ton of people today regarded as the fathers of CS were philosophers. The logic that forms the basis for modern mathematics and CS is entirely analytical philosophy, a field started by Frege. Subsequent giants include Godel, Turing, Herbrand, Church, and so many more. One of the most important advances in the foundations of CS, the [Church Turing thesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis), has very deep connections with philosophy. Perhaps the most famous open problem in CS today, the [P vs NP problem](https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/p-vs-np-problem), the solution to which comes with a $1 million dollar prize, also falls in this list. Do philosophers get the same kind of pay that people in CS do? I guess not. It is extremely unfortunate, and probably of irreversible harm, that research today must be dictated by immediate return on investment as opposed to epistemological value. The lack of STEM support for COLA just goes one step forward in this direction. At this juncture, here's a book that I absolutely love that explains why research for the sake of research is important: it's called [The Usefulness of Useless Knowledge](https://www.ias.edu/about/usefulness-useless-knowledge), written by [Abraham Flexner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Flexner) the first president of the Institute of Advanced Studies, the man who brought Einstein and so many others to the US in the middle of the last century, and revolutionized education in the country.  


Now the obvious question will be ""Oh but surely the UC can't afford this, you're going to end up hiking tuition in the process how is this fair?"" I did the math a while back, and a $1500 per month COLA for ALL 27k UC grad students across ALL campuses (which is more than a COLA, since $1500 is *not* the COLA for all campuses) costs the university \~$370 million annually, which is **1% of its operating budget. Just \~11% of this budget is recovered through tuition.** [Here's](https://ucop.edu/operating-budget/_files/rbudget/2018-19budgetforcurrentoperations.pdf) a link to the 2018-19 budget. Bear in mind that the university has not made attempts to even offer some increase in pay: the $2500 a year is peanuts and the grounds for qualifying for it is evaluated by FAFSA, which makes it unclear if this is at all going to reach out to international students.   


This might be a good time to mention that I have an official document from UCSC that tells me that they *expect me to pay \~$5.5k per year out of my pocket* to meet the expenses in Santa Cruz.   


I found the communication sent out by the university to be extremely hostile and in bad faith. It's not like UCSC pays a ridiculous amount, and I have severe doubts about whether the university will ever give us $1412 a month, but it can and should increase pay to at least meet their own expectations of cost? Even places with ridiculously low rent in the Midwest, Texas pay in the same ball park. I have friends getting the same pay as I do and paying $400-$600 in rent. Many state schools with much lower costs of living also pay $500-$600 more per month! This also brings up the point that UCSC has just *82 units of graduate student housing,* which are just rooms in a shared apartments, each going for $1211 a month! This is unheard of, even in the UCs! UCSD and UCSB offer housing in the range of $600-$900 a month, and Berkeley, which also has expensive housing, offers entire [university owned apartments](https://housing.berkeley.edu/manville) for the same price! Now sure, there's been a lot of resistance to building new housing on campus, and I don't completely understand it (neither do I understand the obsession with low density housing and NIMBYism in general in this part of the world) and even if I were to disregard their concerns which I am sure have at least some value, why is the little on-campus housing that is there, so expensive?    


Also, to undergrads saying ""Oh we're getting the really bad deal here because we pay tuition and also do research on the side and now I'm not learning anything, which was why I came here in the first place""  
(a) People need to be pushed to some unfavourable extreme to have to give everything up, risk whatever little they have, and strike day in day out. We should really recognize that.   
(b) The tuition problem is almost entirely unique to the US. Like I said, I come from a developing country and even they can sell quality public education for peanuts. To put things in perspective:   
the average class size was about 25, even though for the first 3 semesters we had larger classes of 100, and we had 3 TAs for classes of this size. This was uncommon even back home, and our universities aren't as shiny as yours, but it still makes me head spin that tuition is so ridiculously high in this part of the world when the country itself is so much richer.   
(c) A big reason why the US has excelled in research, and has over decades, attracted as many grad students from all over the world as it does (far outnumbering those in similarly wealthy countries), is the culture of research here and the focus on research beyond immediate economic value (for a while). This is why you have the best professors, and the best students in the world. If this stops, I am certain your quality of education will suffer as well. The well being of your teachers reflects on how well/effectively they can teach you as well.  
(d) I went to a school that was honestly a LOT harder than UCSC. I would typically take 5-6 courses per semester, and as a TA, I can assure you that the stuff was both a lot more advanced than courses at similar levels here, and a lot more harshly graded. I also did research as a requirement for my degree. The pressure to get in was ridiculous, the pressure to graduate respectably once you did, made that pale in comparison. The competition and pressure was even unhealthy. By the end of college, I was sure that nothing life could throw at me could be worse. And yet, 5 months into grad school, I can see the pressure mounting and am ready to take back what I said. Less than a year ago, I was in your shoes, saying that grad students have an easy life. They do not. Low pay just makes it so much worse for mental health and everything else.   
(e) Grad school involves a lot of sacrifice. However, I for one think it is not great to say that you should expect to suffer because there's a reward at the end. If there are resources to make the road easier, they should absolutely be used to ensure the same; if nothing else, it only ensures better output. Universities value research, and the health and well being of their grad students is critical to research output; that is where the COLA comes in. If there aren't sufficient resources, then I would say that it is better to offer a quality of service that can be afforded by what you have by paying those carrying it out a living wage, instead of expecting them to take it anyway out of desperation.   
(f) Is it inconvenient? Yes. Including for those actually striking, I imagine. But that is the point of a disruptive strike. This has been going on for a while, and it is the refusal of the admin to take the asks seriously that has led to this escalation. This week has been horrible for me; I've been sick, spent time in the ER and had a lot of trouble to make it to campus for things I just *had* to go for, and even then I didn't really mind it. I'm sure there are others in worse situations but I'm inclined to think that for most, unless you've made up your mind, it's not a dealbreaker.   


This is not to say that the strike is flawless. I am not in agreement with several steps taken, but none of that is enough to invalidate the reasons for the strike altogether. Don't demonise what strikes stand for. They got us almost all of the rights that we take for granted today.   
Here's one last thing to end this with. The mail from the UCOP was ridiculously hostile. But did it say that the UC could not afford to pay a COLA? I don't think so. In fact, what communication from the UC does say that it cannot afford to pay the COLA? What I read it as was ""You agreed to this so why are you crying now, we can't give in to your demands because it makes us look weak."" I am hurt that this is how administration would speak to its students. This brings me to my next question: in a deal where 83% of UCSC representatives already said no to the deal presented, what could they have done to not accept the deal? It doesn't seem to me that there was any reasonable course of action to do so and yet the fact that ""You accepted the deal"" is being used for all arguments by the administration makes no sense to me.   


I'm willing to take back things I have said here, and apologise if need be, if proved/convinced wrong. But I hope you take the time to read and appreciate what I'm saying."

These greedy grad students would have you believe just because they are 3-fold as rent burdened as we were, they deserve more money. Don't they know we are giving them a top tier education, after which all sorts of doors will open up to them? This is the price you have to pay to join the vaunted elite, to get all those really highly paid PhD jobs!

Myself, as a tenured professor, feel people just don't understand what price they have to pay to join the very fair and cool workforce that will treat them well. It's like Baberaham Lincoln used to say ""Every American has the right to an extended internship in their mid and late 20s, before competing for a limited number of semi-desirable positions and then resigning to working in the private sector"". In fact, the private sector is so great, I took one look at it and entered the academic path 40 years ago, back when things were EXACTLY as hard as they are now.

Also, I feel like strikers are really hurting the most vulnerable students a ton. I am very pro-diversity, so much that I sometimes write words about it and am on committees that are for more diversity too. It is important that we have more diversity, because the only thing really wrong these days is that meritocracy isn't colorful enough. I even go the extra mile, and when I have minority students in my classes I tell them that racism is bad and that stereotype threat really hurts and they are like ""Wow, thank u professor"" and then they do better. Makes my heart grow like 3 sizes right away. I also know that low-income students must be having a great time at UCSC too, because I never see any of them - they must be graduating really fast, because they are 4-5 fold underrepresented. 

When you really get down to it, graduate students are only striking because they are bad with money, chose the wrong major and grew up as entitled millennials. If they'd just budget better (do you really need the brown rice when the white one from the food pantry will do?!) and all go into STEM which solves the real problems of the world. Also, if everyone would learn to code everyone would be well paid, because that is just simple logic. 

Just remember kids, never ask for stuff - that's entitled. You will get what is rightfully yours. Also I am very, very brave - because it takes a true warrior spirit to come out and say ""actually I'm doing fine and I think things should stay as they are"". It takes the very bravest of souls to stand up for the status quo! 

So anyway, off to yoga class.

I am interested in this information. Is it true? If so, it supports my belief that the government is quite able to pay its workers a living wage.

The text:


I'll admit right now that I'm an undergrad and by no means I have access to all the information that one would need to really understand this entire COLA/Strike situation, nor do I wish to try and address all of it, but what I keep seeing is that there isn't enough money like you said('UCSC is poor') and that the UC regents and the UCOP aren't actually corrupt or mismanaged.

For one thing, there does seem to be funding available. According to the Legislative Analyst's Office,:

    State Budget Has Capacity to Fund Some University Cost Pressures. In The 2020‑21 Budget: California’s Fiscal Outlook (fiscal outlook), we calculate the state’s budget capacity for the coming year. In making our calculations, we first assume the state maintains existing services, as adjusted for inflation. For the universities specifically, we assume the state covers salary, pension, health benefits, and debt service cost increases. After accounting for these types of cost pressures, we estimate the state would have a $7 billion surplus. Given certain risks to the General Fund, we recommend the Legislature limit new ongoing spending commitments across all areas of the state budget to around $1 billion. In the case of the universities, any remaining ongoing pressures (such as enrollment growth, expansion of services, and new programs or campuses) likely would be up for legislative consideration for a portion of this $1 billion. After making new ongoing commitments, the remainder of the state surplus would be available for one‑time commitments, accelerated debt payments, or larger state reserves. If the Legislature would like to direct some of the remaining surplus to the universities, we encourage it to give high priority to addressing the universities’ unfunded liabilities and facility maintenance backlogs (including seismic renovations). Addressing these liabilities now would reduce the burden on future generations and improve the fiscal health of the state and universities.

    Legislature Has Some University Options for Expanding Budget Capacity. Our fiscal outlook assumes the state covers inflationary cost increases, with no increases in tuition for resident students. However, one key option available to the Legislature for covering additional cost pressures is to share ongoing university cost increases with students through a tuition increase. We estimate that every 1 percent increase in tuition raises associated net revenue by about $15 million at UC and $10 million at CSU. Another option would be to work with the universities to pursue efficiencies in their operations and facility utilization. The amount of freed‑up funding that could be redirected would depend upon the specific efficiencies pursued, with some options creating budget‑year savings but others not yielding savings until later years. Another option would be to factor campuses’ reserves into state budget decisions. The Legislature could be strategic in the use of these reserves—using them to protect ongoing university operations during an economic downturn or using them to address key one‑time priorities, such as deferred maintenance, in the budget year. Each of the university systems potentially has hundreds of millions of dollars in reserves that are available for such spending purposes.

Emphasis mine. Again, I fully admit I am probably pretty ignorant about this whole situation, but I fully believe this report illustrates that the money is in fact there. Now, this does ride on the assumption that the state does in fact allocate their budget as such, but the sentence I highlighted in the second paragraph brings me to my next point which is the state of the UCOP and UC administration.

Now, this article is old(2015), but I believe the general trends it describes still hold true unless the UCOP have somehow cut down on their staff by like 40% in the last 5 years.

    Weeks after an announced increase in state funding staved off a tuition hike, the Board of Regents riled spending critics this summer by handing 3% raises to some of UC’s highest-paid employees. The number of those making at least $500,000 annually grew by 14% in the last year, to 445, and the system’s administrative ranks have swelled by 60% over the last decade — far outpacing tenure-track faculty.

    For two decades starting in 1990, the regents allowed the system and its employees alike to stop contributing to the plan, which was overfunded at the time but now has a $12-billion unfunded liability, according to UC’s latest operating budget. Despite warning signs as early as 2005 that the fund was headed for trouble, it was not until 2009 that the regents acted to resume contributions the following year.

    Efficiency experts brought in to assess the UC Berkeley bureaucracy a few years ago concluded it was top-heavy. Bain &amp; Co. consultants tallied 11 layers of management between the chancellor and front-line employees, suggesting that the organization had too many bosses. More than half of all managers — about 1,000 — had three or fewer direct reports, and 471 were in charge of exactly one person each.

    It is the next layer of well-paid administrators that has grown most significantly over the last two decades. From 2004 to 2014, the management and senior professionals ranks swelled by 60%, to about 10,000, UC data show.

    Administrators now outnumber tenure-track faculty members, whose ranks, over the same decade, grew by just 8%, from 8,067 to 8,722, and have not kept pace with rising enrollment.

There is also this slightly more recent article from the LA Times in 2017 that highlights many of the same issues. I won't bloat this comment any further with more excerpts, but the gist is the same: the UCOP/UC administrative staff has been growing at an alarming rate, faster than the rest of UC staff and their pay has been going up at a faster rate than other equivalent government workers in similar positions.

I will admit that running the UC is probably a really really hard job. The world is changing fast and incorporating new technology and ideas in a timely manner is probably even harder than I can imagine, but the numbers laid out in the two articles suggests to me that perhaps somebody or somebodies are being a liiiiittle too lenient with the salary bumps. Again, I'm not an expert, I'm literally still a student, but I really think the UCOP is bloated and putting tax dollars towards salaries instead of our education."

The same goes for the bus drivers, librarians, janitors, part-time lecturers, dining hall workers, clerical staff, nurses, mental health counselors, undergraduate advisors, groundskeepers, dorm cleaners, and all the other servants at the university. If you're not going to serve me exactly when and where I demand it, what's even the point of having you?   


If the servants don't want to be poor, then why did they choose to work here? Can't they just abandon the 5 years of research they've already done and all the professional networks they've painstakingly nurtured and go be a low-paid servant somewhere else? Didn't they understand, when they first came here years ago, that rent would go up by more than 50% in just 4 years? Ugh! The servants are so dumb, aren't they?

The servants are even blocking the entrances to campus! Instead of just staying home to study like a sane and rational person, I paid for an Uber (driven by another servant) to take me to campus. The servants didn't let me through!

I’m not sure if this subreddit is the place to ask because I don’t really use reddit but I don’t know where else to go. Basically I just had it confirmed to me that my mom (who lives down in LA) is in an emotionally abusive relationship and I don’t know what to do. This man was emotionally abusive towards me over the summer but I didn’t know he was worse towards my mom. I’m a completely wreck from learning this, and from having my own past memories dug up, and I’m just sitting here sobbing. And I don’t know what to do because I have a midterm paper due Monday and I don’t know if I can focus on finishing it tomorrow. 

On the crisis counseling website it says to go to crisis counseling if “you or someone you know is being abused” but I don’t know what they could do to help me. He isn’t physically abusive at all so it’s not like they can just call the cops. Besides emotional support and maybe getting my paper extended, is there anything they can actually do to help the situation? Are there any resources on campus that can help me? I have no idea what to do :("

I knew that eventually the servants would give in, and thank goodness, because *my parents pay a LOT* for me to be here. There is really nothing more important in the world than making sure that the servants give *ME* exactly what I want **RIGHT NOW.**   


I know the TAs were upset that they **can't pay their rent**, they cannot afford food, that they move around all the time and are **evicted**, that they have to drive for Uber on the weekends, that access to many of life's basic necessities are unavailable to them, that some of them go **homeless** and live in their cars, and all that, but I'm just so glad my servant finally saw the light and gave me my grade!   


If my servants can't afford to live here, I don't get why they don't just go live somewhere else. Can't they just abandon the 4-5 years of research they've already done, throw in the trash all the professional relationships they've painstakingly nurtured, and work somewhere cheaper? When they first moved here years ago, didn't they understand that **rent in Santa Cruz would increase by 50% in just 4 years, and that their wages would not increase at all?** Servants... they're so dumb!  


I hope that all **the rest of my servants** on campus learn their lesson, too. I hope they understand that ***they should live in poverty so that I am catered to*** and made comfortable as much as possible (MY parents pay THEIR salaries, after all). That goes for the bus drivers, janitors, dorm hall cleaners, dining hall workers, undergraduate advisors, groundskeepers, repair workers, clerical staff, mental health counselors, part-time professors, and **all the other servants on campus**. They have no right to ask for **basic things like a fair, living wage.** Especially when they don't give MY grade to ME right NOW. 

&amp;#x200B;

It made me sad to see so many undergraduates striking with the servants! Don't they understand that **you're not supposed to mingle with servants?** On Friday, when campus was clearly shut down, I decided to go anyway, instead of studying at home like a sane and rational person. I had my parents pay for an Uber (driven by another servant of mine), but *the pesky servants wouldn't let me through!*

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't bother me that **all the servants have to live in poverty just to make sure that I'm taken care of**, that I'm made comfortable, that I can get a degree quickly. They only exist to serve ME. Everyone should have to live in poverty to take care of ME. Don't they understand? That's what servants are for! For ME. **That's all that matters. ME, ME, ME.**   


Anyway, who else's servants finally caved? What grade did you get?"

Also, I think I have a lot of trouble because the teacher takes so long to explain everything really slowly and meticulously and it just confuses. My grade has totally suffered because of this and at this rate I will fail this class without a shadow of a doubt. I don’t know if I should try to get a tutor, which I’d really rather not; or if I should just give up on the class and retake it another time do that I can focus on my other classes, which I could definitely be doing better in. I am 100% fine with retaking the class that doesn’t bother me at all, but I’m not sure if there could be negative ramifications that I’m not aware of."

&gt;Feb. 24, 2020  
&gt;  
&gt;To: Faculty and graduate students  
&gt;  
&gt;From: Interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer  
&gt;  
&gt;Subject: Clarification of programs offered to graduate students  
&gt;  
&gt;Last week, acting Vice Provost and Dean of Graduate Studies Quentin Williams and I met with graduate students, department chairs, and faculty regarding the grading and teaching strike. We came away with a strong sense of our shared commitment to supporting our graduate students. We also heard genuine confusion about the quality and scope of these programs. In an effort to find a way forward together as a community, I would like to clarify the programs and describe new details that resulted from our conversations.    
&gt;  
&gt;We heard concerns that making the $2,500 housing supplement “needs-based” would disqualify many from eligibility, particularly international students. To address this concern, we will remove the “needs-based” condition, to allow full-time, in-residence doctoral students within their first five years, and Master of Fine Arts students in their first two years, to receive the supplement. We also heard concerns that the cost of the housing supplement would be borne by departments. That is not the case. The housing supplement will be centrally funded. In addition, we commit to regular reviews of program funding levels.  
&gt;  
&gt;We also heard many concerns from students and faculty about the letters of warning remaining in our graduate students’ employment files as they move forward. They are concerned that the letter may impact future employment on campus and in their post-graduation careers. To address this concern, we are committed to the following:    
&gt;  
&gt;For students who immediately resume all of their TA/GSI appointment obligations, including teaching and holding regularly scheduled sections and office hours, and for whom we have verified submission of fall, winter and spring grades, we will rescind their letter of warning at the end of this academic year.   
&gt;  
&gt;Additionally doctoral and MFA students who resume their TA/GSI appointment obligations will receive the $2,500 housing supplement retroactive to Sept. 1, 2019, for the 2019-20 academic year. Doctoral and MFA students supported through GSR/Fellowship appointments will be included in the retroactive receipt of the housing supplement available at the end of the academic year.    
&gt;  
&gt;I want to take this opportunity to clarify that fall-grade submission, including the removal of the temporary P grade, will be verified on Thursday, Feb. 27. This provides instructors of record and course-sponsoring units the time needed to submit final course grades once they have full grading information from fall TAs.   
&gt;  
&gt;I am grateful for the honest conversations I have had with members of our community over the past weeks. My hope is that this message provides clarification and assurance of next steps. The opportunities described here are intended to help bring our campus community back to its teaching, learning, and research mission."

It does show UCSC as the most expensive after UCSF, but only $100–$300 more per month than the other expensive campuses (UCB, UCLA, UCSD, UCI, UCSB).  The $2500/year housing stipend being offered to UCSC grad students compensates for this difference."

And how can you possibly think that everything can be just free, and that socialism can work?

The fact that we’re even debating socialism in 2020 makes me really scared for our country. Shame Donald Trump all you want; yes his tone may not be the best, but at least his policies are mainly good. That is much better than having a nice tone with bad policy.

Here is an example why socialism doesn't work (do you guys even think about this?):

An economics professor at a local college (Lee University) made a statement that he had never failed a single student before, but had recently failed an entire class. That class had insisted that socialism worked and that no one would be poor and no one would be rich, a great equalizer. 

The professor then said, ""OK, we will have an experiment in this class on this plan"". All grades will be averaged and everyone will receive the same grade so no one will fail and no one will receive an A.... (substituting grades for dollars - something closer to home and more readily understood by all as socialism).

After the first test, the grades were averaged and everyone got a B. The students who studied hard were upset and the students who studied little were happy. As the second test rolled around, the students who studied little had studied even less and the ones who studied hard decided they wanted a free ride too so they studied little. 

The second test average was a D! No one was happy. When the 3rd test rolled around, the average was an F. 

As the tests proceeded, the scores never increased as bickering, blame and name-calling all resulted in hard feelings and no one would study for the benefit of anyone else. 

To their great surprise, ALL FAILED and the professor told them that socialism would also ultimately fail because when the reward is great, the effort to succeed is great, but when government takes all the reward away, no one will try or want to succeed. 

Would you distribute your hard earned A in a class to those who barely even studied?"

The future has always been a daunting idea, yet we can only ever push forward into these uncharted waters. Just because you don’t understand something now, doesn’t mean you won’t ever. Just because you failed one test, doesn’t mean you’ve truly failed! If you’re unhappy now, don’t take it as an excuse to be unhappy forever.

Just remember 2 things:

-You are not defined by a number on a paper

-Permanent solutions should never be your answer to temporary issues

Graduate student workers at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), who live and study in [one of the most expensive and overburdened housing markets](https://www.salon.com/2020/01/25/do-i-do-research-or-pay-rent-grad-students-in-santa-cruz-start-a-wildcat-strike/) in the country, didn't think they were demanding too much when they went on a [wildcat strike](https://www.salon.com/2020/01/25/do-i-do-research-or-pay-rent-grad-students-in-santa-cruz-start-a-wildcat-strike/) last month to try to win a modest cost of living adjustment (COLA) pay increase.

Then came the riot cops. 

Rather then engage with the student workers' sensible demands for having their basic survival needs met, administrators at UCSC opted to send in police in riot gear to greet the nonviolent protesters at the picket line at the base of campus. The police, which consisted of a combination of University of California police along with cops bussed in from other campuses and counties, beat students with batons and paper-arrested at least 17 nonviolent protesters. The university has since issued a [statement](https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/02/protests-and-arrests.html) on the arrests of February 12, calling the strikes ""unsanctioned."" 

""Administration told us that sending in this extra policing cost $300,000 a day,"" Yulia Gilichinskaya, a fourth-year PhD student in Film &amp; Digital Media who has insider knowledge of meetings with administrators, told Salon. The expensive supplemental police presence on campus, which lasted a week, seems to call into question the administration's narrative that a cost of living increase would be unaffordable, Gilichinskaya notes. 

Last week, Janet Napolitano, president of the UC system and the former governor of Arizona, [sent a warning letter](https://www.salon.com/2020/02/19/university-of-california-president-napolitano-threatens-to-fire-all-striking-grad-students/) to faculty and students who were participating in the wildcat strike by withholding grades and teaching assistant duties. ""Holding undergraduate grades hostage and refusing to carry out contracted teaching responsibilities is the wrong way to go,"" Napolitano [wrote](https://www.salon.com/2020/02/19/university-of-california-president-napolitano-threatens-to-fire-all-striking-grad-students/) in the Feb. 14th letter. She continued: ""Therefore, participation in the wildcat strike will have consequences, up to and including the termination of existing employment at the University. . . . We urge the striking TAs \[teaching assistants\] to turn in their grades and return to the classroom.""

As graduate workers note, such a threat of termination is not only alarming, but it also belies the only functional labor model for academia, in which graduate students are paid to teach and grade within their own departments. This work-study model is standard pedagogical practice at all American graduate institutions. \[*Editor's note: the author was a graduate student at UCSC from 2015-16, but has no relationship with any of the sources or institutions in this story.*\]

""Napolitano never addressed who would replace grad workers,"" James Sirigotis, a fifth-year PhD student in sociology, told Salon.  

Sirigotis, who was one of the protesters physically injured by police, noted that faculty members understand this contradiction innate to Napolitano's threat. 

""The faculty are really well-organized and voted to endorse our \[cost of living adjustment\] demands . . . They asked the Executive Vice Chancellor \[Lori Kletzer\] and Chancellor \[Cynthia Larive\], 'What was the plan if they were willing to fire these TAs? How do you expect us to be able to teach? How do you expect the university to operate?'""

""The response was, 'We don't know, we'll cross that bridge when we get there,'"" Sirigotis continued. ""That probably contributed to the growth of faculty support — when \[faculty\] realized they did not have a plan and would fire \[graduate student workers\] without a plan as to how teaching would continue."" 

Indeed, faculty members have been supportive of the strike, and generally haven't crossed the picket line. Gilichinskaya notes that many faculty have opted to hold their classes off-campus, away from the base of campus where the picket line is.

While Napolitano's threat seems to have scared a few graduate student workers, it also seems to have ignited a solidarity movement — both among students on campus, students at other University of California campuses, and with national political stars. 

According to a press release from Pay Us More UCSC, the name of the organized wildcat strikers, ""At least 85 UCSC grad students"" out of around 500 graduate student workers have continued to withhold grades despite administration's Feb. 21 deadline and firing threat. Likewise, multiple UC campuses have threatened work stoppages and strikes if Napolitano follows through on her threat to fire said students.

""The entire graduate student body of a dozen campus departments have also signed pledges refusing to accept Spring quarter appointments if UCSC terminates a single one of their colleagues,"" the Pay Us More UCSC press release noted. 

Meanwhile, many UC campuses held rallies supporting UCSC graduate workers' demands and insisting the administration back down on its threats. University of California at Santa Barbara held a rally on their campus in support of a cost-of-living increase; video from the rally, which depicts hundreds of student protesters, can be viewed on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/B82DpYCAvZV/). [University of California, San Diego](https://www.instagram.com/p/B8zb11sADro/) held a similar rally, as did Irvine and [UC Berkeley](https://www.kqed.org/news/11802744/uc-berkeley-graduate-students-contemplate-solidarity-strike-with-uc-santa-cruz). Likewise, undergraduates at UC Santa Cruz have come out [en masse in support of their graduate coevals](https://www.instagram.com/p/B8eJmQ9gwWH/). 

Shockingly, police brutality against student protestors is not confined to UC Santa Cruz. On Thursday, Feb. 20, at a solidarity rally for graduate cost-of-living-adjustments at the University of California, Irvine, a black undergraduate alumna, who was passing by the rally to order a transcript, was tackled by UC Irvine's (UCI) on-campus police. She was booked in the Orange County Jail and arrested with assaulting an officer, as the UCI Police Department [noted](https://www.facebook.com/113006688769963/posts/3410963052307627/). The UCI Black Student Union, in concert with other on-campus activist groups, have started a [petition](https://www.change.org/p/uc-irvine-chancellor-howard-gillman-accountability-for-the-incident-regarding-a-black-uci-alumna-on-2-20-2020-at-uc-irvine?recruiter=1036919767&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_initial&amp;recruited_by_id=34e1ea90-40c4-11ea-a22b-8592fac9d65f) to the UC Irvine chancellor demanding accountability. 

If UCSC and Napolitano follow through on threats, a grading and teaching strike at other campuses is likely to ensue. 

Likewise, students do have another huge ally on their side: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the leading Democratic candidate for president and the [most popular politician](https://www.salon.com/2017/03/23/bernie-sanders-has-become-the-most-popular-politician-in-america-with-no-help-from-the-inside/) in the United States according to polls. 

""UCSC grad students are fighting to have their labor rights acknowledged,"" Sen. Sanders [wrote on Twitter](https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1230288311006134274) on Feb. 19. ""I strongly urge the president of the UC system to stop threatening them, especially immigrant students, for organizing.""

Notably, many striking UCSC graduate workers are international students, meaning that their U.S. visas are dependent on their campus employment. Firing them, as President Napolitano promised, is tantamount to deportation — a cruel repercussion that the students strikers were quick to point out.

""The threat is real,"" Gilichinskaya, who is herself an international student, added. ""I see a lot of support from the strikers — we're very well organized, so we might find a way to support each other so that no one has to leave the country, and I also see faculty organized in such ways so that they can support the striking students.""

""So I'm not freaked out just yet, but I realize the consequences,"" she concluded.

Because this is a wildcat strike, the graduate student workers' formal union, United Auto Workers 2865, is not directly involved in labor negotiations at the moment. Doing so would possibly violate the contract they negotiated with UC-wide administration previously. Still, the UAW Local 2865 has been working to ensure that any COLA adjustment won by strikers becomes a permanent legal feature of their contract.

Indeed, UAW 2865 hopes to bring the cost of living adjustment to all students with a ""statewide COLA"" movement that they are pushing, according to an anonymous joint council member who was not authorized to speak publicly for the union.

To that end, UC administration offered a retroactive, $2,500 stipend to all MFA and PhD students at UCSC. Curiously, the offer excluded other masters degree students, and was offered as a housing contingency to graduate *students*, not graduate student *workers* — meaning such an offer is technically outside of the scope of a union contract. (Not all graduate students are also instructors or graders; many are on fellowship, or not working while in school.)

The university specifically calls it a ""housing stipend,"" as one can see in their [statement](https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/01/chancellor-new-graduate-student-programs.html) on the subject, in which the chancellor writes that they are ""instituting an annual housing supplement of $2,500 for doctoral and MFA students offered through the Graduate Division."" 

UAW Local 2865 President Kavitha Iyengar issued a [statement](http://uaw2865.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2500-UCSC-release-1.pdf) regarding the stipend: 

&gt;While we are glad to hear this news \[of the $2500 stipend offer\], it is not enough, for three reasons: first, because it is not under the framework of a union contract and thus not legally enforceable, it is not guaranteed. Second, it is limited to workers at Santa Cruz. As our framework for a COLA demonstrates, workers at every single campus are rent burdened and need this relief. And third, even with these funds, student workers are still rent burdened. 

Gilichinskaya also noted the peculiarity of the school's meager offer. ""\[The offer\] makes a distinction between us as students and us as workers,"" Gilichinskaya told Salon. ""This housing supplement \[offered by the administration\] is for us as students. We won't involve the union, because this isn't about workers.""

In a meeting, Gilichinskaya had a chance to ask UC Santa Cruz Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer about this loophole directly.

f9st0a,An Appeal to Grad Students,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/f9st0a/an_appeal_to_grad_students/,RaccoonFaculty,1,2020-02-26 04:56:14,13,/r/UCSC/comments/f9st0a/an_appeal_to_grad_students/,NaN,"I think you have won your victory with the new deal and have drawn considerable attention to the issue. Now, I think is the time to tactically retreat. I am not a grad student, but have your interests at heart (cliche -- I know), and I am concerned about what happens if the strike continues. My advice to you is to please consider what you are doing and what consequences you can bear. 

I have been, like most faculty, generally supportive of the student driven initiative to address the problem of cost of living in Santa Cruz, and while I didn't always agree with every decision made by COLA folks, I supported their mission. I am worried now that the administration is going to follow through with the non-appointment of Spring TAs. I am more worried that following this there will be greater retaliation, including the non-renewal of visas for participating international students, academic misconduct charges, and general black-listing from not only TA positions but all UC mediated funds. 

If I had a crystal ball (or palantir as most faculty do), I think Janet Napolitano is going to be the face of draconian retaliation that will end the careers of many grad students; the strike will grow; the final victory will be her planned resignation. The newly appointed president will, as a gesture of good faith, roll back some of the more vicious retaliatory measures, and the movement will end with grad students gaining little more than was already offered to them as of this week.

 Except we will have lost a generation of scholars. Critically, we will have lost our most vulnerable and activist scholars. Please be careful. We need you around, not just for the services you provide as grad students, but as future forward-thinking academics."

My enrollment time is March 4 at 3:30pm. I am hoping to enroll in the following classes, and made an argument about why it should go during first pass:

LGST/POLI 105C - theory class that many Legal Studies/Politics majors and minors take. The last time it was offered it was basically fully enrolled. I'm a Legal Studies major and this is the most convenient quarter for me to take a theory class.

LALS 15 - has a class size of only 45 people with no discussion section. It seems like this is the first quarter its being offered and does not have an instructor assigned yet. I am worried that it will be fully enrolled very quickly, or under enrolled and/or cancelled. I need to take this to fulfill the SR GE.

LGST/POLI 120A - class that many Legal Studies/Politics majors and minors take. The last time it was offered it was basically fully enrolled. I'm a Legal Studies major and this is the most convenient quarter for me to take this class to fulfill an upper div major req.

I'm thinking about reaching out to someone at the LALS department to get more info about LALS 15. I think I have a better chance of getting into LALS 15 either off the waitlist or with a permission code than the other classes (if it's not cancelled), so I'll probably do 105C and 120A during first pass.

I legally changed my name but every time I log into anything new that is affiliated with the school, it has the wrong name still posted.

FFS, even the app to put flexis on my student account had the wrong name still (I ended up just deleting it, since there's no way to update the information in the settings). Even my school email was under the wrong name. It's been 5 months and I'm still uncovering a name issue every goddamn week. 


Does anyone have a list of all the third party logins tied to the UC, so I can fix it all instead of being blindsided every single time I try to use a new service? It's starting to drive me insane (and most of the time it takes, optimistically, 3-10 business days to fix it, so I'd rather do it all at once if possible).

1. BIOL 105L - Eukaryotic Genetics Lab with Jimmy Shanks

4. BIOL 120L - Developmental Lab with Jeremy Kreher  
\-I'm probably most interested in this subject, but I'm worried about his grading style. At least with Shanks and Gurun I might have a better idea of what to expect. Is it worth the risk??
5. BIOC 110 - Advanced Chemistry Lab with O. Einarsdottir  
\-Never heard of this prof and there's nothing on Rate My Prof, anyone have any info? 
6. METX 119L - Microbiology Lab with Chad Saltikov

While sympathetic to the strikers, I do understand there are people for myriad reasons would want to cross the strike line. So with that in mind, there are a few ways to get on and off campus without having to use the entrances. They do take a little bit longer, but you'll get through. 

1) Kind of the first one you should try is to cross through faculty housing. It's by far the easiest and quickest. There are trails that you can take that will get you close by the Church of Christ. Look [here](https://goo.gl/maps/sy7QDwtpH6vnJGGo8). 

2) Sometimes protesters/strikers realize students are using the faculty housing trail. A valid second option is to go through the pogonip. Yeah, it sucks, but it'll get you where you need to be. 

3) My personal favorite was to go by way of Porter Caves. Either Lyft to there or from there (just tell your driver that you're bypassing the entrances. In case you don't know, come up Western and not Bay or High. If you're leaving Campus and have a bike, it's a fun ride down. 

4) You can also go through the arboretum. 

Hope that helps. Like I said, I'm generally sympathetic to the strikers, but life happens or you have an anal professor that won't cancel an exam. Strikes/protests happen every year (it seems like) at UCSC so you learn about these alternate routes."

Telling students to ignore the UC's order and show up before 7 (even if you work at that hour) to get on campus to even take a test way later in the day. 

Suggesting in the event of shutdown students go AGAINST the orders of the school and likely cops when they barricade the street again to stop people from joining the strike. Regardless of the fact that students will need to get past an angry picket line and even jumpier cops that could end up as a bystander in a repeat of what happened before and end up arrested and sent to student conduct for suspension.

Arrested as a striker when you are trying to get to class, expelled/suspended for being a striker.

Solution if base is too heated to cross? 

A professor actually suggesting to sneak onto campus through the woods, some of these paths can get you hurt if you arent in hiker boots due to slipping and if you have a disability in your legs like i do forget about it.

And god help you if you dont know where you are going if you are coming from up north and never been in those woods.

Sleep on campus and break rules again, that YOU get in trouble for.

On campus rallies that will likely be harassed by cops and you can get caught in between that too? That caused BSOE to shut down and can get you suspended if the cops mistake you for a protestor? Still show up.

So against school rules and policies and BSOE's decision to keep their own staff off campus for safety reasons, professors are telling students to break those rules when told to not come and put themselve in possible physical danger over a test the professors refuse to reschedule? 

How is any of this OK for a faculty to suggest student safety is an OK possible sacrifice when told directly by the administration to keep them and staffers home?

Its really obvious that the entire STEM department needs major change **if professors feel that an order by the UC is just a suggestion for them**. This entire department has done some heinous shit before like when one called a muslim a terrorist or called the cops on a crying black student, but to suggest you get to this test even if it leaves you stranded in the forest with a bad leg else you fail the entire course is a whole new level of fucked up."

They want to hold midterms even in the event they are told to cancel them. They shouldnt be allowed to over rule a UC order to not hold class and view it as a suggestion.

Telling students to go at 7 AM, or just force your way through base and walk no matter what the cops or protestors do. Even if that could mean you get caught up in the middle and arrested as a protestor by the cops and suspended for 2 weeks.

Base too dangerous? Suggest to sneak in through the woods you likely never been to, or suggest routes you know but is dangerous for people not familiar with it and have no hiking boots to stop slipping.

and if you have a bad leg or disabled and can get stranded in an unfamiliar forest with a bad leg/disability? tough luck. Still gotta show up.

Or just sleep on campus and get in trouble for that too or ticketed for something you were forced to.

The BSOE shuts down for safety reasons and a big rally is going to happen on campus which you can get caught up in? Show up anyway, safety is for faculty not for students.

STEM professors should not be above UC rules and gamble with student safety by suggesting ways that all involve a risk to health, academics, or future. The STEM department has done heinous shit before like when one called a muslim student a terrorist or when another threatened to call the cops on a crying black student, but this takes the cake to suggest that no matter what your situation or consequence its their way or the high way.

Especially when they put the entire university in legal liability should anything happen tomorrow because of their bad advice, I dont understand how the UC stands for it and doesnt punish them in any way.

At some point something has to give here."

Are these actions approved of by striking grad students?
If not where are your voices?
If yes how so you talk about not hurting undergrads?

I support a COLA. I can rationalize and understand withholding grades and slowing the campus down with blocking entrances, I can. Recent admin decisions show that worked. That's using your leverage at an (arguably) minor impact to undergrads. 

Disrupting a midterm does nothing to bother admin, only faculty and students, both of who's support a COLA campaign (I imagine) would seek.
 I don't see how this fits into the picture for them, and my current suspicion is that the student coalition (who was comfortable breaking onto the on campus Chancellor's house) is the catalyst for a lot of more radical action, and they get lumped together with COLA.

This got longer than I intended, I hope it gets read/answered."

CS students.

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a job actually contributing the society.

We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of connected graphs all to draw out a single extra point of optimization, saving thousands of dollars for corporations.

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know every little detail such that some have attained such coding nirvana that they can literally reverse a binary tree blindfolded.

Do these people have any idea how many keyboards have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed in frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take away our midterms? We're already building a new one without them. They take away our classes? STEM students aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even teaching our selves. They think calling us racist, mysoginistic, privileged, bootlickers is going to change us? We've been called worse things by blue haired humanities nobodies with their iPhones and Yerba Mates. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.

CS students are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight."

This is an official response from the COLA campaign and not simply my own opinion. We hope that with this we can open up dialogue about what happened today and what your concerns are for the future.  


&gt;We want to directly address today’s interruption of the CSE102 midterm. Care must be taken to ensure that our mass divestment from a broken system does not unnecessarily harm those who, for the moment, need that system to exist. We feel that we should have been more careful today. To those students whose midterm was interrupted, and to Professor Tantalo, we sincerely apologize.  
&gt;  
&gt;We recognize the very real impact this had on students, both in terms of emotional stress and  potential harm to your scores. We also thank Professor Tantalo for giving extra time to complete the exam as a result of the interruption. We are nevertheless aware that extra time does not necessarily make up for the stress and anxiety caused by your midterm exam being interrupted.  
&gt;  
&gt;The movement for a Cost of Living Adjustment continues to grow rapidly, and welcomes a diversity of members, experiences, and tactics. This, however, inevitably comes with the potential for misunderstandings and actions that unintentionally do harm to both the movement and those affected by it. We recognize this as both an ethical and tactical misstep.While strikes are inherently disruptive, protesters did not realize that they were disrupting an exam until it was too late. Our intent was to invite STEM students, many of whom have been hesitant to join the picket line, to learn about the history of radical activism at UCSC. It was not our intent to interrupt an examination in progress.  
&gt;  
&gt;We hope you will engage with us to help us learn from and repair this misstep, and do better in the future. Already we strive to improve our communication with undergraduates, both supporters and nonsupporters alike, to minimize harmful impacts upon undergraduate education. In particular, we hope that division-level town halls may allow us to better address undergraduate concerns. We will announce these town halls after finalizing their preparations, and encourage any undergraduate with grievances or concerns to attend, and be heard.   
&gt;  
&gt;The COLA movement aims to increase the visibility of all students’ struggles, including the underlying structures that  produce undergraduate and graduate student stress in the first place. We do not aim to increase the burden of university dysfunction on undergraduates. We are so grateful for all of the undergraduates who have united with us in our struggle, and hope to continue working alongside you all in improving our collective conditions. We, too, want nothing more than to return to our classrooms and to complete our courses of study. The sooner academic workers are paid enough to live in Santa Cruz, the sooner we can return to our studies and our teaching, at what we hope will be a healthier and more productive university.

We would like to reiterate that we are taking this very seriously; the entire organizing committee is currently discussing solutions to prevent situations like this from occurring in the future. If you have any questions or concerns, I will do my best to answer them here."

Let's be honest. Every time you get a warning email or every time you see a police officer, you post angry tweets about how the university is doing this, the university is doing that. Everything remotely tied to the university is interpreted as the university's **certain will**, aiming toward oppression of grad students. 

""The university is threatening to deport students"", ""the university is threatening to fire us"", ""the university is hiring police officers"". When the police officers arrest strikers -- ""The university of course sanctioned these police officers to arrest us; the university is an all-powerful, unified, all-seeing force, like the eye of Sauron"". 

**And then when your own strikers disrupt our midterm**, suddenly it's ""Oh well some people must have misunderstood instructions."" ""I'm sure they didn't mean it"" ""It certainly wasn't our intention, so it's all fine"" ""This does not represent the COLA movement as a whole, we had no part in deciding this"".

Why so generous and lax with interpreting your own intentions and taking responsibility for your own actions when **your movement's rhetoric hinges on assigning intentionality and blame to the University, the STEM professors, the whoever?** 

Because it doesn't matter if the university isn't organized or if the strike movement isn't organized. It doesn't matter that the university makes infrastructure mistakes, and that you have made infrastructure mistakes -- **At some point along the way, the results have become unacceptable,** both for your living wage and for our education. You have the right to protest, but we also have the right to take our midterms. 

Fix your organizational control and take some responsibility. Just because you need to disrupt the system to have a successful strike doesn't mean you aren't responsible for your rogue strikers (if they really were rogue). In order for a strike to be successful, it also needs to not spiral out of control. Whatever you were trying to do here, own up to it and fix it. 

**Don't think that claiming ""I didn't mean it"" will clear your name in the eyes of everyone.**

Sincerely,

A frustrated undergrad student"

It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that interrupting classes for students who are not supportive of the strike will end up badly. Especially when you are directly told “that is a bad idea”. 

I understand why you are striking and I agree that you have a reason and a right to strike. But this latest action has proven to me that you have to idea what your doing and I won’t support a movement that either doesn’t understand the consequences of their actions or lacks the empathy to understand."

I’ve been consistently going to the strikes and emailing my TAs and professors to show my solidarity on COLA. I’m going to give you a very simple reason why. Because I support in doing the right thing….whatever fault you find in any statement, you cannot ignore the virtue or purpose of what's behind it; and the virtue in this case is that we are literally trying to make hundreds of TA’s living situation better. Getting this COLA directly impacts the quality of education us undergrads gets, and I would never ask them to educate me while living in circumstances of financial precarity, housing insecurity, and food instability.

That being said, I went to the march yesterday and I want to share what happened.

COLA marchers posted around the SNE court/quarry to listen to a beautiful well-said speech about the history of UCSC student’s fight against a system that feeds off the burdened. As we ended that rally, we were getting to continue the march when I noticed the group split into two: one group for going into a classroom and the other to continue the march. I decided to choose the latter because personally I did not believe that disrupting a classroom would be effective, as students in classrooms have already invested in going to class and they weren’t simply going to leave. We could gather more support from bystanders/colleges out on the street than people who crossed the picket line.

Now, I have no quarrel with people in CSE 102, and I totally understand where you are coming from. But please, stop acting like this march CAUSED you to fail. Tantalo gave you an EXTRA 30 mins (you’re welcome) and if you failed that probably means you didn’t study enough. I’d like to also point out that that midterm is super fucking minuscule in the grand scheme of things. VERY VERY MINISCULE. Why are you so caught up on something you’re probably going to forget in the near future? Let me ask you this, is a conglomerate, tech, oil-funded corporate going to ask you in an interview how you did in a CSE 102 midterm thats worth only 20%? No 

And if you are “annoyed by the inconvenience” then why don’t you show some solidarity so we can get a goddamn COLA sooner and return to regular school schedules because NEWS FLASH, WE ARE ALL ANNOYED."

I'm a 2017 grad - I have experienced and saw year after year how rent has increased while the lack of available rental has decreased. But I've also done my research about the Bay Area housing crisis and have taken measures for this-- working 2-3 jobs at a time, living in doubles or triples. I understand how this may not be feasible for those who come to UCSC as a grad student with family  and dependents, but common, how could you not have researched what a shit hole for living costs it is here?? And even if this is the only school that accepted you, you have every opportunity to decline admission and try again for a program in an area that you can afford, or at least give you a stipend that you need. 

After UCSC, I've entered medical school where tuition costs 50k a year + living expenses. None of it is paid for and UC grads get free tuition ANNND a stipend. I dedicate so much of my time on campus doing research, school, TA-ing, and still find time to work for what my loans can't cover. Literally in every single graduate degree minus a PhD, we have to pay full tuition!!??!??! 

From just observing how everything is playing out, I'm shocked at how grads can twist this narrative to involve telling undergrads to support, yet fucking them over in every way possible.. 2-3 weeks of canceled classes are literally thousands of dollars. interrupting a midterm with blatant disregard to students who upholds their education was stupid, reckless, and incredibly disrespectful. Not even going to touch on how the response letter was obviously a half ass apology, ending with ' lol u should still support us we didn't mean it'. It becomes clearer each day how much this movement is derailing and spiraling. 

Oh and we gotta love all these COLA worriers who berates anyone who dares to say anything negative against this movement."

Remember the HongKong protests that filled the front page of reddit a few month ago?

What I want to say is there are always people in a protest who “cross the line” and hurt innocent people who supports them. Hell, even the Civil Right movement have the Black Power counter part. And for you who think other protest you supports doesn’t have extremist like the COLA strikers, think this way. If anything about this store goes famous in Reddit it will be police arresting strikers instead of striker harassing commoners, and I bet the top comment will be people hating on the admission and giving strikers support, and anyone dare to show the other side of the strike will not get enough attention. If you are just an outsider looking at those posts, guess what will your reaction be?

However, I’m definitely not asking anyone to change their mind on the issue, but instead trying use this as a chance to show you guys the more complicated problem of protesting."

To start - test taking is vulnerable. You're likely hunched over, deeply focused and searching your brain for a small detail from a lecture two weeks ago. The interference was all about power. They knew it was a test, and they came in to surround us and yell at us. 

When that many people storm into your classroom, it induces a fight or flight response. It didn't feel safe. By the time all of them were in the room, I felt a little shaky. People tried to yell back at them at first, but after a minute most people realized that we didn't have any power, so we kept working on the test. I had to redo the same problem 3 times because I couldn't focus on it. (anyone in 102 knows missing one box in that coin-change table could mess the whole problem up).

Also, many of the protesters were filming. (Maybe one in five? Hard to say, looking back). And most of them were smiling, some laughing. We were being filmed without our consent. There was no intention to recruit us for the strike. We were being talked down to, scolded, and laughed at. I know there's a lot more footage out there, I hope it will incriminate them.

In the end, after they left, I noticed that one of the students was crying and had to leave the room. (Completely understandable, it really sucked to be trapped and yelled at). The protesters were yelling at us for 10 minutes about how we lack empathy, but ironically they lacked it themselves. I was able to finish the test and feel good about it, but for anyone who had test anxiety, was affected by being yelled at, or didn't feel as confident... it was probably a lot worse. 

Don't downplay what happened. If you know one of the protesters, report them for disturbing the peace. I hope they all get arrested."

I attended as many of the pickets as I could, including Doomsday 1.0 (I couldn't make it to 2.0). I have done everything I possibly could to demonstrate solidarity and provide support to the striking students. 

I have also approved of every major tactic utilized by the strikers, with a few notable exceptions I will discuss later. While I don't think one needs to be radical to support civil disobedience, my political views all align well with a redistribution of surplus budget towards paying UC workers more, including graduate student TAs. Of course, the best possible option for achieving this goal is to build a coalition UC-wide large enough to deny any unacceptable union agreements. However, considering the past vote and the strikers' claims of being in crisis, I feel safe admitting that withholding labor is the next best thing. What has been effective about the strike so far, in my opinion, is its streamlined purpose - for the most part the strike has remained focused intently on COLA. After police intimidation on the part of the UC, some anti-police rhetoric entered the general strike corpus, but I can forgive that as a response rather than a lack of focus. 

There are two specific actions that I condemn outright: the withholding of some students' grades even upon request and the interruption of the CSE 102 midterm. The force of this strike should be to minimize pressure on undergraduates and maximize pressure on the UC. There's always going to be collateral damage in a movement like this, but aside from these two events (which place immense pressure on vulnerable undergraduates with little to no pressure on the UC) I think the campaign has handled itself fairly well in this respect. I believe both of these circumstances were a direct result of the COLA campaign's free-form, ""democratic"" structure, not its message or intent, so I only assign partial blame to the campaign. However, after these events it would be best for the movement to tighten its plan and guidelines some to prevent something like these from happening again. 

The campaign has made it clear here and elsewhere that grades will be returned upon request, and the times I've seen a response to a TA's refusal the campaign leadership has promised to look into it. Considering the leader of the midterm group has been identified as an undergraduate, I also believe that the campaign did not intend for this specific event to take place. 

That being said, I assign full blame to campaign leadership for their ""apology."" They should be doing everything they can to both distance themselves from and condemn the midterm disruptors. This strike will accomplish nothing if it loses its momentum. While the statewide solidarity and action on other campuses is a good sign for this momentum, a movement dependent on large-scale action to put pressure on an employer as large as the UC simply MUST protect its optics. UCSC is at the heart of the COLA strike, and we need to set an example for other campuses. It would be a huge mistake to remain indifferent on the event that took place yesterday. That mistake is antithetical to the cause, and could have far-reaching negative effects on the state-wide movement. Be careful: the world is watching.

TL;DR: Strike leadership publicly disapproves of withholding grades from students who ask. They should also publicly condemn the midterm disruption and consider organizing more strictly to prevent bad optics and pointless harm to undergraduates."

I've posted here before about how stressed I am already with my major and how detrimental it has been to my mental health and now add it onto this mess of a strike. Every day I have at least one panic attack and it's only be getting worse. The fact that I have no clue when this strike is going to end and how much it has affected my education here will be the death of me. As an undergrad, I hate how you said that you were not going to hurt the undergrads and yet you've pushed me to the edge with my mental health and here I am deciding not whether I can make it to class or not, but whether I should fucking live or not. I know I am one of the more extreme cases but I'm already struggling with coming to terms with my mental illness and my current state in my major, I have no energy left to protect myself mentally from this strike. After seeing what happened yesterday with the midterm, something has to be done with the leadership of this strike. And no, I am not just an incel-troll on reddit, I am a girl who is just trying to survive in CS and who is just trying to live.

To: UC Santa Cruz Community  
From: Interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer  
Subject: Update on grade strike  
   
Dear Colleagues,  
   
As you are likely aware, in an effort to better support our Ph.D. and MFA students and help address the very legitimate financial concerns they have raised, we announced and implemented a number of new campus programs to help alleviate their financial burdens – and we are working together to provide greater levels of support. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts to find an amenable resolution, 54 teaching assistants have continued to withhold fall grade information. As a result, we have been left with no choice but to take an action that we had truly and deeply hoped to avoid. As I previously shared, students who fail to meet their contractual obligations by withholding fall grade information will not receive spring quarter appointments, or if they have received them they will be dismissed from their spring quarter appointments.  
   
We care deeply about our graduate students, value their contributions to our campus through both their scholarship and research, and their work as teaching assistants and graduate student instructors. It is extremely disappointing to us that we have to take such a drastic step, but we ultimately cannot retain graduate students as teaching assistants who will not fulfill their responsibilities. While we have been able to successfully get 96 percent of grades submitted for the fall quarter, we cannot again jeopardize our undergraduates’ education or put them in a position where they may not have the teaching resources they need to succeed throughout the spring quarter.  
   
I want to thank all of you who have had honest and difficult conversations with graduate students about the need to end this unsanctioned strike. Our graduate students are brilliant scholars and, like you, I want to see them succeed at UC Santa Cruz and beyond. No doubt your conversations encouraged some graduate students to return to their important work.  
   
Alongside other campus leaders, I met five times with graduate student leadership with the hope that we could resolve this unsanctioned strike and return to our shared mission of educating undergraduates and conducting research for the good of our society.  
   
While I’ve disagreed with the tactics the graduate students have used to communicate their concerns, I do not want to downplay the gravity of those concerns. The students have highlighted a real need for greater support because of the high cost of housing in Santa Cruz and limited campus housing available to them. As a reminder, in an effort to provide more financial support and predictability for our Ph.D. and MFA students and work toward greater support overall, the campus is:  


* **providing an annual $2,500 housing supplement until more campus housing becomes available for graduate students.** This support will be available retroactively for this academic year for doctoral and MFA students who resume their TA/GSI appointment obligations for fall, winter, and spring quarters.
* **offering new and continuing doctoral students support packages for five years (two years for MFA students).** These packages will have a minimum level of support equivalent to that of a 50 percent teaching assistantship.
* **creating two temporary housing assistance programs to support graduate students through Slug Support.**
* **forming a joint Senate-Administrative Graduate Education Working Group** to develop a strategic plan for appropriate and sustainable graduate program support.
* **convening a new Chancellor’s Advisory Committee on Graduate Education** to examine and make recommendations to improve graduate student support throughout graduate school and beyond as graduate students prepare for a range of careers beyond the professoriate. 

With a clear sense for how many graduate students will continue serving as teaching assistants in the spring, we can now begin planning for how we deliver an education to our undergraduates. As I shared at the Feb. 19 Academic Senate meeting, this is a problem for us to solve. I am committed to working closely with all impacted departments and providing additional resources so that we can continue with our mission. I will soon be visiting impacted departments to join in discussions about our curriculum.  
   
This has been a difficult time for our campus and we have more problems to solve.  
   
We all believe deeply in the mission of UC Santa Cruz and public higher education. We have the privilege to teach a diverse student body and provide them with knowledge and skills that can transform their lives. We have the honor to cultivate scholars who will be the next generation of professors and practitioners. And we, as professors, help reshape our world, whether it’s through ideas, inventions, and discovery.  
   
I look forward to continuing to fulfill our tremendous mission.  "

A couple of days later, I emailed the professor in charge of the class, and have once again not received a response.

The responses I have seen by COLA supporters are unapologetic and belittle the concerns of those that were taking the midterm. What I hear is “sorry, but...” which was the same sentiment the protesters had when they barged into the midterm and told those taking the exam to “care about something for once.” Pure fucking overstepping righteous arrogance. 

What was their goal in alienating their support base? Undergrads have supported the grad students in their campaigning but it seems like this move was a target towards STEM majors. 

Th “apology” claiming that they “dIdNT KnoW” they were taking an exam is a lack of accountability. It is not assurance that it won’t happen again.

Unless disciplinary action is taken (those involved should no longer be allowed to participate. Yellow shirt SHOULD NOT be the face of the COLA. I just saw a picture of him leading a group on the UCSC FB page). I am officially rescinding my support for COLA. Not because I don’t believe in the cause of a living wage, but because I don’t believe how it is harming undergrads who are also struggling to get by."

Dear Cognitive Science and Psychology Majors:

With Spring enrollment starting on Monday, March 2, we regret to inform you that our Department will be unable to offer our expected number of seats next quarter. Based on what we know, we will only be able to hire about 20 of the 40 graduate student Teaching Assistants (TAs) we would have needed for our planned curriculum. To preserve the quality of instruction, we will need to reduce the number of available seats for Psychology courses in Spring 2020.  

As you likely know, graduate student strikers and the campus administration remain in conflict over financial support. This conflict has prompted some TAs to continue to withhold Fall 2019 grades and organize a strike that has lasted several weeks. Interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Kletzer has rescinded TA appointments for those graduate students who did not submit their Fall grades. In addition to the students who withheld grade information, some graduate students have pledged to decline TA appointments if any TA appointments are rescinded because of grade withholding. 

We have taken a number of steps to minimize the impact of this conflict on undergraduate students. For instance, we have added classes that do not require TA support, and we have prioritized enrollment for students who plan to graduate in Spring 2020. Still, there is no way to completely make up for the lack of 20 TA positions. 

If you are unable to enroll in a Spring class, you may consider voicing your concerns to the Interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor (officeofcpevc@ucsc.edu) or the Chancellor (chancellor@ucsc.edu). Please know that neither the Psychology advisors nor the instructors will be able to offer enrollment codes at this point, as we do not have enough seats in our classes. Advisors may be able to help you find alternative classes in other departments that may have more availability.

We recognize the stress this situation creates. Beyond the reduction in Spring class sizes, the conflict has impacted instruction this quarter and our campus climate. We hope that the conflict will be resolved soon and that we will be able to restore as much of our planned curriculum as possible. Please stay tuned for more information as we adapt to the situation, and thank you for your patience and understanding.

Sincerely,

Phil Hammack

Department Chair, Psychology"

Screw the people who wrote that. CS102 is one of the hardest and significant undergraduate classes on campus, and I see a lot of non-engineering students on campus completely disregarding that, talking about it like it's some test for some BS general education class you're going to forget about as you walk out of the classroom.

The class is directly relevant getting a job and working in the tech industry since most technical job interviews test candidates with the content from the class. The scores for this class are notorious for being extremely low, making it difficult to pass, and interrupting this class in particular is probably one of the more harmful things you can do to a UCSC student academically and financially.

While you guys are fighting over a cost of living adjustment of $1,412 per month, you're literally ruining the futures of STEM students are likely to have a six-figure yearly salary for their first job after graduating. And if you're thinking now, ""Okay good! We're hurting those evil, greedy STEM students!"" then you have no empathy at all. The blind hatred towards the STEM department is ridiculous. Not every STEM student is the tech villain you think of in your head. Sure, it's true that the tech industry has some bad people doing bad things, but that doesn't mean everyone in tech is inherently evil.

Most of these students are just like you and they're trying to make it through life so they can be truly independent after college and so they can help their friends and families who have struggled so much to get them to where they are today. The students that do make it through this particular class will probably go onto build the very things you use and will use every day. Just look at computer, your phone, and the website you're on right now... all of those things are built by STEM students. It will be a damn shame if a student drops out of their major because of the failing over an already extremely stressful and challenging midterm, just because foolish protesters decided to stomp in and screech."

\+ Supposedly more practical
