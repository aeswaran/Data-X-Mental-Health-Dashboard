I'm an incoming freshman and I'm wondering how accurate the 35k projected cost of living UCLA provides is. I'm guessing officially the only costs that you must pay are tuition and housing. The other numbers must obviously depend on person to person, but does anyone have any experience spending significantly less than the projected cost? I don't plan on spending really anything on transportation and my only real cost is probably going out every so often and textbooks. (Speaking of, how much on average do people spend on textbooks?)

Is there anyone in Westwood who has a spare room I could drag all my belongings into for 10 days or so? I'll take care of the moving in and moving out. I probably need like 20 square feet or so.

First off, I'm aware that they give out free condoms on campus but I heard they are kinda cheap and basic. I like to use a specific type and brand of condom. Particularly Durex Mutual Climax and Durex Extended Pleasure. I doubt they have those for free. I like them bc I find that they make me last the longest and ensure maximim stimulation for my partner. I've lasted up to 45 minutes with the Extended Pleasure. Funny enough, I'm not a fan of Trojans (no pun intended). Fun fact: longest I lasted was like 2 hours.

Anyway, gonna be moving into my dorm soon and I'm wondering where the best place to buy condoms is around Westwood. In high school, I had my go-to spot for condoms (Sam's Discount Liquors) where I would go to every week to stock up. It wasn't the cheapest place but it was the closest. Where in Westwood would be the best place to make my new go-to? Ralph's or Target or rite aid or some other store? Ok question for the fellas on here: where do YOU guys usually get your rubbers?

Edit: I think I remember asking about this at orientation and my NSA mentioning that they have like, vending machines with condoms and stuff on the hill and campus. Are they legit? Anybody use them? If they do have those machines, cool, but it won't help much if they don't have the brands I like. Which is why I need recommendations for places in Westwood. 

Prices: are they cheaper at one store over another? I know this seems like a silly question bc at most it's only a few cents difference. But if you buy them a few times per month the costs adds up. Multiply this by four years and yeah, it adds up."

To explain my situation, I've submitted all documents requested of me by the university, so sometime midsummer I still hadn't recieved an awards letter yet. I ask friends if they have and everyone I talked to said they'd already recieved an awards letter.

Two weeks ago, I call Financial Aid and am transferred to a Financial Aid Advisor, we speak for maybe 5 minutes. In that time, the gentleman on the phone tells me their offices are working full-time to make sure awards letters get out before school starts. He tells me to wait two weeks.

Two weeks come and go and my documents have gone unreviewed and with less than half of month remaining before school starts, I'm worried about my awards letter. I absolutely need that in order to be able to attend.

So I guess my question is, is this happening to anyone else?

If I need a 3.8 to get in, I need a 3.8 to get in and that’s what I’m gonna do but I don’t wanna be needlessly sacrificing other parts of my life to achieve that if it’s not even actually necessary.

During my quarter off, I was diagnosed with a few things and have been getting professional help and now I'm enrolled in summer courses, and with the help of CAE, I have been successful. Got 3 A's and 1 D (my D is before I enrolled in CAE where my professor did not accept my doctor's note which was the reason I enrolled in CAE for summer session C).

It seems like they're trying to sell you a product, and it doesn't even appear to be a university anymore. UCLA isn't coercing people to come to their school and boasting about its network. Every page on the UCLA website gives the impression that it's a world class research university. I don't even see how USC is seen as a peer to UCLA. I'm from the east coast, and UCLA is well-known here whereas people think of USC as University of South Carolina. It's been established that UCLA has serious strengths and prestige around the world. I am 100% convinced that USC exists just so rich SoCal people can circlejerk about how private education is better than public schooling. And by paying your way into the school, you too can join the Trojan Circlejerk Network where you get off about how much better USC is than UCLA. 

I asked some people about USC vs. UCLA law and they couldn't deny that UCLA had better placement. All they said was things like ""our campus is better"". But taking a look at it, the USC Gould Building was much uglier than UCLA Law. No point to this post, just giving my perspective."

So I am currently a community college student looking to transfer next fall...UCLA being the top choice \*wish me luck for admissions ripppp\*\*. However, I am pretty torn about my major.... I have changed it multiple times from majors such as political science, criminal justice, etc... all within the social sciences. I've never really found a major that I am genuinely passionate about and the uncertainty that comes with that is so stressful. I definitely am not suited for a STEM major. Not going to lie, I somewhat cherry-picked anthropology just because I was running out of time and needed to choose a field with a reasonable amount of major prep courses so that I can transfer in time (because I need to submit apps soon). Not to say that I do not enjoy the anthropology classes that I am taking, but I have a difficult time believing that it will really get me anywhere in life as it is not a traditionally respected major such as CS or Bio. Ultimately, my end goal is to go pursue law school after my undergrad, in which they do accept students of all majors. BUT will the skills acquired from an anthro degree even be beneficial or worthwhile? Part of the reason I chose this major was due to how fascinated I was with an anthropologist's perspective... being able to objectively analyze situations/people/etc. and effectively communicate their thoughts. But I can't help feeling a level of embarrassment when people ask me what my major is because they are quick to make negative assumptions. That sounds extremely ridiculous because I know that I am a hardworking student who is dedicated...but society has gotten to me sadly and I try to fit into other's mold when the only person I should work to impress is myself (and my future employer of course LOL). When i do transfer, regardless if that is at UCLA or at another UC campus, I am afraid I will be unhappy and that I have wasted all this time and money... i guess the main purpose of this post is the question: **Is an anthropology degree a waste of time if I am trying to pursue law?** \- sincerely, a confused 19 yr old gal :("

I've been in Orange County for a few years now, and I have not found a place or group of people who are UCLA alumni or fans.  The chapter that is down here is not very active - so I was wondering if there were other Orange County Alumni  or fans who would be interested in getting together to do watch parties, have some events, networking and the such.  Looking for something casual with some other UCLA fans, alumni, active students or the like.  If you're interested please shoot me a DM or add a comment and I would love to start getting something together.  

Would love to get a local bar for watch parties, organize tailgates, do some networking events.  

I am in the Irvine/South Orange County area, so let me know if anyone else is interested!"

Prospective transfer student here. It hadn’t crossed my mind until this month, but do I need to take an equivalent to a Writing II class as part of the 7 course pattern? 

I’d use assist, but the updated website has been frustrating to navigate and is only letting me check major requirements and not transferrable classes by department, which is making me concerned that the English class that I’m currently taking (For IGETC Area 1B) is not Writing II equivalent. 

I attended UCR my first year, but only got as far as the second course of their one year English sequence, and it appears as if I needed the last course to count for Writing II. I really don’t feel like taking another English class at my current CCC next semester, but if there’s no equivalent, then does that hurt my chances for admission?"

I’ve heard that the math/econ major is much harder, and I’m afraid that my GPA will drop if I switch. At the same time, I’ve also heard that grad schools look more favourably towards math/econ majors than pure econ. 

Do you think switching to math/econ is worth the risk or not? How much more difficult is it to get into grad school with the pure econ major instead of math/econ? Should I instead just take statistics courses and other math courses to supplement my econ major to make it more mathematical?

So I pretty much failed my first 3 quarters because of built up depression etc and wasn’t able to reach my academic potential I had when I was in high school. My parents are both immigrants who came alone and both passed away and I ended up making it to UCLA. I managed to get fully covered besides a small loan but because of the depression and feeling of being alone etc I couldn’t make it. I’ve taken about 5 months to recollect myself and I feel as though I can do it right this time. 

The problem is I got sent a letter in the mail that I owe 4 grand since I got a loan and failed my first year. I have no financial support since I have no biological family alive in the US and my hometown is 4 hours away from UCLA so commuting is not an option. After being dismissed or kicked out I really don’t know how I can get a second chance and I really need help. Anything helps I really appreciate it if someone can suggest any options for me."

I’m a prospective Psychobiology major for Fall 2020. I’m currently taking an equivalent of Physics 1A, and was potentially looking at taking the equivalent to Physics 1B, and then I saw that I would need to concurrently take a Multivariable Calculus class to take it. I really have no interest in taking another calculus class, and I wasn’t sure if it not taking the next physics class would make me less competitive for admissions? The catalog recommends 1 year of Calculus-Based Physics.

Some context:
Attended UCR my first year, currently at a CCC
- Used AP Credit to place out of a (non-life Science) Calculus class focused solely on derivatives. 
- Took a life science calculus class about Integration and their techniques
- Took a Calculus class (no version was available for life science majors), about sequences, series, and the calculus of parametric and polar functions 

If it means that I’ll need to take another calculus class I’ll do it, but in the event that I don’t, is it possible to go from Physics 1A to 5B at UCLA (assuming I’m accepted)?"

If you're even thinking about rushing, do it. It's pretty much commitment free, you don't have to accept a bid. If anything it's something fun to do during zero week and you don't actually have to pay the registration fee unless you decide to accept somewhere. 

If you're more serious about it, do some research on the different chapters. Most of them have instagrams or websites you can fuck around on. Ask around if you know someone whos been at UCLA for a while.

Don't accept a bid until the last day. Trust me. It's good to have options. If you get a bid from a house, say thanks and go check out some other houses for the rest of the day. If you have multiple bids, you can meet guys who have accepted their bids at those houses already and see if you vibe with your potential pledge class.

Don't give too much merit to guys trying to brag or flex on you. Some douche in every house is gonna say they have the best GPA on the row or hang out with the hottest girls or throw the sickest parties or have the richest alumni or whatever, take it with a grain of salt. 

Every chapter is pretty much the same thing with a different twist. There's not really a wrong choice unless you really care about being in a top house. It's just about finding a crowd you fit in with, since you're gonna be hanging out with and probably living with those dudes eventually. 

Fraternities are fundamentally a non-profit business. You're paying money to be a part of an organization, so it should have something it can offer you beyond access to parties. Are there scholarships available? A test bank? What do they do as a chapter besides the stuff that every other house does? Leadership opportunities?

I will be taking classes in Northern campus at the Broad Art Center, so something within reasonable walking distance to that would be most ideal. I would also be okay with with anything near campus in general, as long as it is close enough to a Metro, Culver City Bus, or BigBlueBus line that could get me up to Northern campus quickly. Ideally, I'm hoping to pay around $50/month ($150 for Fall Quarter) but am willing to see what I can do on my end depending on the location of the parking spot.

I'm also open to buying a parking pass off of someone, although I have no idea how that works or if there is any paperwork that needs to be done. If this is what you're offering then I'd need a bit of help there.

You need to make sure that your email is the same email on your account, specifically the .ucla.edu one and not the g.ucla.edu one. What you do is put “Forgot password” and then set a password if you haven’t done so when prompted on the CTO site. Then try for a ticket.

Also, make sure the email that you put is the email in their system. I had to call CTO to make sure that they were, and it wasn’t. For some reason even though the “official email” was the .ucla.edu one the email they had in the system was my old school email.

I was wondering about my chances of getting in with my given statistics.

&amp;#x200B;

**GPA:** *Freshman:* UW 3.14 W 3.14 *Sophomore:* UW 3.53 W 4.00 *Junior:* UW: 3.83 W:  4.50 *Senior:* UW: 3.89 W: 4.89       (cumulative = UW 3.69 W 4.14) (P.S. my school only goes up to 4.0, meaning no A+)

**ACT:** 33 **SAT**: 1430

**Activities:** 4 year varsity athlete, 4 clubs, lots out of school volunteering

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully you guys can give me pros and cons, or even a blatant ""get in"" or ""not get in"", thanks a lot:))"

I was thinking that I would take either the exemption exam or placement exam to opt-out of taking Spanish 3 after studying over winter-break. I also heard that the placement exam is easier than the exemption exam. 

So here is my 2 questions: 

1) If I get placed into Spanish 4 from the placement exam, do I still need to take a course or is my requirement then fulfilled? 

2) If I fail the exemption exam, can I take the placement exam and get into spanish 4 which then again fulfills my requirement?

Both treatments involve repeatedly confronting feared sensations and situations, known as exposure therapy. One treatment focuses on methods to enhance the learning that occurs during exposure therapy, while the other emphasizes reducing fear during exposure therapy. Each of these therapies include components and therapeutic strategies that have been demonstrated to be effective.


Eligibility Criteria 

Individuals who seeking treatment for anxiety may be eligible for the study if they are between the ages of 18 to 65, are English speaking, are not currently suffering from major medical conditions, and are either un-medicated or stabilized on medications. 


 Screening Procedures 

Interested participants should leave their contact information (i.e., name, phone number, best times to call) at (310) 825-5614. Participants are then phoned by study personnel and asked a few simple screening questions. If eligible, participants are scheduled for an in-person, no-cost, diagnostic evaluation (approximately 2-3 hours) at the UCLA Psychology Clinic. 


Payment and Fees 

Participants will be offered 9 weeks of free treatment and a $25 Gift Card at the end of the study!


Treatment Procedures 

Treatment is conducted one on one, over 9 weekly visits at the UCLA Psychology Clinic. Assessments are conducted prior to beginning treatment, mid-treatment, at completion of treatment and 3 months later. These assessments include diagnostic evaluations, a battery of self-report questionnaires, behavioral observation, and physiological recording in a laboratory.

d6pk7v,Need Advice with Roommate,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/d6pk7v/need_advice_with_roommate/,gift9671,20,2019-09-19 21:13:37,7,/r/ucla/comments/d6pk7v/need_advice_with_roommate/,NaN,"Hi guys. I've been living with my roommate for a year now now and I think she is batshit crazy. I live in ucla housing because it is a really good deal I can't afford to move out. I've never lived with a roommate so I need some advice on what I should do. I know this post will be long but please if you are experienced in this, please help. 

I live with a intl student and while I understand cultural diffs and stuff I think she really crosses the line. Amongst not cleaning at all, leaving food around the house for days until there is mold, stealing communal furniture and putting it in her room, putting her instruments, work out gear, and just general shit in the communal living room, the thing that pisses me off the most is that we've been here a year and her mom has stayed over at least 5 times (lost count) for more than a week each time. The reason? She doesn't clean her room or her bathroom or do her laundry or anything so her mom comes over overseas from China to do that shit for her. So like every like 6 weeks or so, her mom, who speaks literally zero english, cooks in the kitchen and cleans her room and bathroom from like the crack of dawn to past midnight until I say something about the noise (to which her mom doesn't understand and I have to use google translate or something). The weirdest part? My roommate literally leaves home near 8-9am and comes home near midnight. Like, she seriously just uses her mom as her cleaning lady. Oh and my roommate never gives me a heads up. Like one day, poof her mom's staying a week. 

But, however she shits on her mom is like her own business. The problem is that this literally woman is rude af and takes over the house whenever she stays. I can't use my own kitchen or living room because this women is either deep frying some shit all day long, watching loud dramas, or just eating snacks and laying on the living room couch doing her phone. She keeps hacking phlegm and spitting it in the kitchen sink, stealing my food and giving it to her daughter, yelling and taking loud phone calls right in front of my door, and just the craziest random shit. 

And my roommate is very hysteric and unstable and has like these mental breakdowns sometimes early evening but mostly late at night near midnight and early in the morning before 7am. She screams and cries like a four year old in her room with her door open so I can hear her from behind my closed door, which I have sound proofed using two diff methods because of her. She is upset about the most random shit, like some professor telling her to participate more in class and stuff. I'm mentioning this because it gets worse when her mom is here and they yell at each other at the top of their lungs at fucking 5am. 

I'm not being the fussy roommate am I? I have my own shit to deal with at school so it's really important I have a comforting home to come to but her bullshit makes me so stressed. I've told her so many times things were not acceptable but she just doesn't change and frankly, doesn't understand english that well herself for us to have a long conversation. What do I do? I can't afford to live anywhere else."

I feel like shit bc I'm not even qualified to be here, and in the free time I had with not studying for school, I was working on EC's. What can I do to makeup for this, and make sure I do really well here? I've never learnt to work hard in high school, and coming here I feel stressed out like crazy."

I plan on transferring here (hopefully I get in knock on wood) for maybe econ/bus econ as I know la doesn’t have a business program. However, I was eating at one of the dining halls yesterday and three seniors sat next to me and told me that econ/bus econ is one of the toughest majors on campus. Many of the people they know dropped out. Is this true? I’m kind of worried now. Would it be smarter to major in something like psychology since I heard you can really major in anything for business.

today’s welcome event or whatever was suuuuuper overwhelming. This has always been where I want to be but now that it’s real, it’s scary as hell. 

I realize now that in order to truly make this the experience I want, it is gonna have to be on me to seek the communities I belong in and be proactive to make friends. since I’m not just put into the social environment, I’m going to have to be immersive.

   I'm anonymous. I'm in love with a boy. 

 He's an electrical engineer. 

We worked together at asucla. You were a soundtech. 

I'm terrible at expressing my feelings but I'm gonna try because Jim from the office taught me to shoot my shot.

 I'm sorry for the emails. I'm not good at this clearly. It took Jim 7 fucking years, I'm trying my best out here. I always knew I liked you, but I was afraid you'd reject me. 

I adore(d) you dude.  I knew from the moment I met you, I just like knew. It's hard to explain but it's a feeling of being complete. Like I've found the ying to my yang. The moon to my sun. I'm the loud vibrant, wild one and your the dark, mysterious, calm one. You're the sparkle to my glitter. 

An ever changing puzzle, I'll never truly be able to solve. 

Maybe that's the real reason I adore you, you're a challenge.

You're quiet which is fine. You don't like to share it's fine. You're an introvert by nature. Makes you deep like Da Vinci, Monet, Michelangelo, a deep artist that spends more time painting the beauty around them, then recognizing their own genius and beauty. I know it's hard to get out of your head, but I'm hear and I'm telling you, you're an absolute genius.

I like Tony Stark or Oppenheimer. Tells me, all you want to do is make the world a better place and have a sarcastic sense of humor. That's the reason I am who I am. I just want to make the world a better place. 

When I told you I cried thinking about you it wasn't a bad thing, it was more like a ""wow, I met that 1 person, I've experienced that soulmate feeling humans spend their lives searching for."" Its hard to explain it's like the odd or rare things that make you happy, like walking in the rain or dancing to your favorite song. You can't get struck by lightening if you aren't standing in rain. You might not get it because your scientist. 

Sorry, I'm crazy. Probably should've led with that tbh. Also you should've figured out early on I was crazy. I kept you up all night texting about stupid stuff or keeping you from your hw with game of thrones. (I was kinda right. They did bang in the end) 

I deleted all of our conversations. The next time we see each other, if we ever meet again it will be as strangers. Thats probably the part that hurts the most. Because I don't want to be strangers, friends is good enough for me. All the great loves of my life are my friends. 

I'm an aquarius, I'm a hapless romantic. I see the world in rose colored glasses to a fault. I know if you ever read this, you'll never make the effort to reach out to me because your afraid, I'd get bored and move on. 

Well, news flash. Life every step in life is an adventure, with the right people. And while you'd like to dismiss it, you like adventure. That's why you stayed. Its why you kept talking to me. Because I never cease to surprise you. 

Am I ho. Maybe and maybe not. Don't believe everything you've heard. Stories exist for a reason. 

I told my little you were Brian, because otherwise she would've tried to make your life miserable.  Passionately fighting for those you love is a fam trait. 

You once asked me about my email in the elevator. I think that was you shooting, shot but I'm not sure. I was busy training someone man.

It took Peter parker 2 movies to get mj, so like bruh it's a process. Don't give up. I'll figure this out and maybe you'll say yes after x number of times. Or you'll say no.

    I love you. You're absolutely perfect. Any girl would be fucking lucky to have even just a moment of your attention. You have an eletric soul, that just captivating and awe inspiring.

I smile just thinking about you. You're laugh is infectious, I want go hear it everyday. 

I love the idea of going on adventures with you, even if it just turns out to be ice cream and Netflix in Js living room. 

I can't remember my life before meeting you and I don't want to imagine a life without you. You're a piece of my soul. 

Without you I'm afraid I might drown, in the ugly gray that is life. Thank you for adding color to my world. 

I'm crying and seriously cannot breathe, because writing this makes my heartache with how much I love and adore you. It's annoying but I love it, and I love you Timmy. 

You're like a melody in a song, you make me want to dance barefoot in the rain. You are the sunrise that brightens the morning, the enchanting stroke that makes midnight. 

If you read this. Just know I love you more than I love myself. 

Always,
    A.

I'm currently in my second year of community college and I am applying as a transfer for Fall 2020 at UCLA.  However, for next semester, Spring 2020, I need to make a decision between the second semester of my language requirement or the second semester of calculus-based physics. I completed one semester of both so far, but I cannot take the second semester for *both* of them in two years. I was wondering if I absolutely have to finish my two semesters/one year of language, or if I can finish it after I transfer and take the second semester of physics instead. I don't want to lower my chances of getting in by not having physics under my belt, but if the language prerequisite is a must, I will take that over physics so that I am able to transfer. Any thoughts? Thanks in advance :D"

so here’s what happened:

earlier yesterday I get invited to a sorority party by a girl name “S” who’s promoting the sorority, along with 10000 other super pretty girls in different organizations. It’s set to start around 10:30 @ night, and I’m too meet her at a certain spot on campus with a couple other people so that we can walk over in a giant group. I invite a friend from Hs (we’re both freshman—let’s call her J) via text just so I’m not alone, and she agrees. So we both get to the meeting place, and the girls are pretty genuine and nice and sweet and we all walk over to the house. I find out it’s actually a joint party with their brother frat, so there’s guys and girls too. As soon as I walk in it’s ridiculously crowded in a small space OUTSIDE (only the girls that were a party of the sorority could go inside), and I have to squeeze past everyone. I felt very awk and out of place but I try to merge in, except after denying alcohol and the shared blunt 1000 times I started to feel like it wasn’t my scene, even though I kept telling the main sorority girls that were checking on me that I was having fun—the smoke from the blunts/cigs were burning my throat, and ironically if I DID want to hookup (which I couldn’t have minded) the guy I was looking at looked taken with another cute girl and I accidentally left my protection in my dorm. J and her friend that she brought starts drinking a little so I start monitoring her, and she re-Unites with this cute guy that she meet the previous day coincidentally. I tell her to go talk to him and they start hitting it off, and I genuinely think it’s cute at first. Eventually, the guys friends, my friend, and her aquaintance and I start heading to In and Out, and internally I’m just happy that I can breathe somewhat fresh air again.

Here’s where things start getting iffy.

While J is still hitting it off with the guy, I try to make friends with the guys friends. I can tell that they have no interest in me (example: I asked one pair of girls what their major was; they both said theirs very fast and when I said mine one of them said “cool” very fast and they resumed their conversation as if I wasn’t there). At In and Out, me, I and the guy she’s flirting with sit inside. Back at the party, she had asked me to please go with her just to make sure she gets home safe and that everything goes smoothly, and ofc I agree bc I care about her safety. Now @ in and out, when the guy leaves to get his food and it’s just me and her, she thanks me again and I tell her she looks a little tipsy but not too bad. We’re all at the same table, they’re talking and eating while I’m swiping through tinder (lol) trying to be invisible (I didn’t have to try it worked naturally) and making sure everything went smoothly. Eventually, the guy finds out his friends are outside so me, him, and my friend all move outside with the same girls that paid no mind to me earlier. I felt a bit lonelier than ever sitting between the guy’s friend group that was closed off to outsiders, and my friend and the guy. Eventually, the guys’ friends start heading back to their dorms, and then it’s just the trio of me, my friend, and the guy again. I’m still scrolling through tinder.

And finally, the lonely walk back home. We walked about a mile back to our dorms, J and the guy are about 50m in front of me, me behind them. She hasn’t looked back once to check on me or make sure I’m still following them, not even at the stoplights. We get back to the dorm entrance, and the door closes ahead of me while they keep going, and to make it worse some other people crowd ahead and alongside me too. I try swiping my ID to make the doors open, but then, I waited around the corner of the wall of the elevator on purpose and hear it close. I knew I had been a good friend making sure my friend had gotten back to the dorms ok, but I felt so damn third wheel like. Ik she was hitting it off with this guy but I just wished she had looked back to make sure I was still following them at least once on the walk home, I could have easily been snatched or disappeared quietly or no one would notice. Back at In and Out she said that she’d totally make it up to me, and to be fair I did say multiple times that “it’s fine”/“have fun”/“as long as you’re safe”. I felt like I couldn’t be assertive because I saw how happy she was with him, yet deep down inside I knew that she wouldn’t have seen him that night if I didn’t initially tell her about the party. I went up the elevator, alone. I went to bed feeling a little used, but I felt like I didn’t have a right to be mad. I told her that I was fine, that I’d be the sober friend, that I’d make sure she’s okay, and I kept my promise. It’s not the first time I’ve third wheeled. 

It’s 1:30am now, about an hour after In and Out now, and I FINALLY get a text from her (the photos I sent). I didn’t reply, it’s late and I’m just feeling so many things. Like I said, I feel like I can’t be mad bc I told her all of those things, but also bring the third wheel/doormat for yet *another* time doesn’t feel great either. Truth is, I didn’t have fun at the party. I pretended to. Breathing in smoke every 5 seconds, trying to be social, and thr body heat wasn’t appealing to me. The alcohol did smell nice, but I just couldn’t bring myself to drink any. I don’t drink or smoke, so there wasn’t much for me to do besides awkwardly stand by people or my friend. The sorority girls, however, were nicer than some the actual new girls. They knew we were freshman, we exchanged numbers and I gave her updates about where I was after we left. I’ll never forget them.

All ik is that I’ve been a good friend, but I felt so lonely in that big ass crowd of people. 
I still haven’t replied to her bc idk what to say"

The newlywed couple Melisa Benoist and Chris Wood are teaming up with Jane Lynch, Kate Flannery, and Wayne Brady to help raise funds for immigrants through a concert.

The show, dubbed “Concert For America,” will take place at UCLA’s Royce Hall in Los Angeles this Saturday night. Throughout the gig, Benoist, Wood, and company will take the stage, as well as Yuri Sardarov, Gina Torres, Grant Gustin, and Caroline Rhea. Other musical and comedic performances will play during the night, as well as speeches.

Proceeds from the event will benefit the National Immigration Law Center – the only national non-profit whose mission is to defend the rights and opportunities of low-income immigrants. The gig will be hosted by SiriusXM’s Seth Rudetsky and James Wesley. “Flash” producer Greg Berlanti and husband Robbie Rogers funded and underwrote the entire event to ensure that each dollar raised would fund the Law Center, [***Variety***](https://variety.com/2019/scene/news/supergirl-melissa-benoist-chris-wood-greg-berlanti-concert-for-america-1203346959/) reports.

 During the announcement, the star of *Supergirl*, Benoist, performed a rendition of Carole King’s “Beautiful” and joined Wood for a dual performance of Irving Berlin’s “Old Fashioned Wedding.” They did not reveal which song they’ll sing together ahead of the show.

“It’s such an important cause and it’s something that deserves attention,” Wood said of the concert to reporters. “Anytime we as artists can lend whatever abilities we do have, or at least interests we have to do something that’s impactful, I think it’s necessary and something we should do.”

The show this weekend will be live streamed worldwide. Visit the concert’s [**site**](https://www.concertsforamerica.com/) for tickets and more information.

So, I’m a biochem major and will be starting my second year in the fall. I’m currently enrolled in Chem 30B with Merlic, Chem 30AL with Henary, and AF AMER M5 with Hunter. I didn’t manage to get Physics, so I enrolled in French 1. I know Spanish but not French so I thought it wouldn’t be as bad as learning some other languages, but I’m thinking of switching French for LS 23L. Don’t really feel like learning a whole new language this quarter lol.

Also, if I do switch to 23L, I would have that three hour lab right before my 30AL lab, so I would have six consecutive hours of lab. I’m going to start an internship in a lab where I’ll be there for six hours twice a week anyways though.

Would taking chem 30B/30AL, AF AMER M5, and LS 23L be too much?

I need to make the switches by tonight, so any opinion would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!"

**Do you enjoy screwing people who though you were their friends over?** 

**Do you love to lie?**

**Then you should play Diplomacy.**

“Sure” you might say, “But what is Diplomacy? “.

 It is hard to capture in a few words, but I feel like “Risk without dices”, or “7 people playing chess with only peons, and with all movements executed simultaneously” captures the essence. What makes Diplomacy so interesting is that its mechanics forces you too cooperate with the other players. No one has an advantage, there is no element of chance, only by convincing the other players in supporting you cause can you advance beyond the first few turns. 

All seven players start with roughly equal positions, and on a Risk style map compete for particular territories containing supply centers

Instead of letting each player move in order, you write down you moves on a piece of paper, and when everyone has turned in their order sheet the movements are executed. Every turn is a nerve wrecking roller coaster, wondering if you opponent/ally has already reacted to your cunning ploy, biting your nails as you hope that you friend is still your friend and that he won’t grab that inviting piece of real estate that you so trustingly left undefended. 

The mechanics determining defeat or victory in a skirmish are easily mastered, leaving high stakes negotiations, lies, deceit, cloak and dagger, you name it, as the true crux of the game. 

“Wow” you say, or “Sounds interesting”, and hear some of you whisper “Actually I have a severe personality disorder and this kind of thing is part of my daily life, so I’d prefer not to play this game”, and that’s okay. 

But, if you fall into one of the two first categories, then I highly suggest that you post in this thread, so that we may gather enough players to fill a table (7), and find us somewhere to backstab each other until only one player remains. 

If you want more details on how the game works, the Wikipedia article is a good place to start. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy\_(game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_(game))

**TL;DR :** 

I’m an exchange student at UCLA this year and I’m looking for people to play diplomacy with! Post here or send me a message if interested.

I like how, when we first got introduced to these a year back or so, it was *your* responsibility to obey the law and drive well, and everything seemed to work out just fine as long as you obeyed UCLA law enforcement, didn't bother others, and didn't ride in the dismount zones. But now that the bikes and e-scooters actually turn off the power when you enter these zones, that introduces a host of safety/accountability issues that I just can't tolerate any longer.

For example, Wheels has an arbitration clause. I learned about it the moment I signed up for the app. In other words, they effectively aschew the burden of responsibility for things that happen to you while you use these bikes (unless I'm really misunderstanding this, please someone correct me if I'm wrong). But that makes no sense, because they take the initiative to double check that you're in a no-drive zone with your location data so you can't be breaking any campus laws and such.

But here's where that gets interesting. The Wheels bike I used earlier today *literally stopped working in the middle of an intersection* because it mistakenly thought I was in a no-drive area.

So let me get this straight: I was driving where the law tells me I'm supposed to drive (in a road, not on a sidewalk, with a helmet on btw), and I'm not allowed to drive in no-drive areas (got it), BUT if the bike is wrong about where I'm located, and *literally turns off the power* while I'm in the middle of a roadway, it's not Wheels' responsibility (remember the arbitration clause) if I get hurt because the bike malfunctioned? I had to literally foot pedal my way to a sidewalk at 2-3 mph, which is totally not safe in a busy trafficway.

That is *a huge safety issue* to me and it is 100% a reason to never ride any of these devices. Look, I get it: I'm told to just look at the map, avoid all areas that are potentially no-drive areas, and you'll be fine. Except *the device* was completely wrong about where I was located and I got stuck *in the middle of the street* and had to walk my way out, and if I had gotten hurt as a result, I can't hold anyone responsible for it because of arbitration clauses.

Also, just to add icing to the cake, you can't park the bikes/scooters in several of the designated parking zones, because those are also mistakenly put in the dismount zones. Lol.

This is ridiculous. I'm never using a Wheels bike ever again. I may just save my money and never use an e-scooter either. If they want me back as a customer, they gotta fix this and give me a good reason to come back. I really enjoyed using scooters last year when it wasn't as stringent, but now I can't stand it, and I can't shake the uneasiness of this whole thing. Thank you for reading if you made it this far.

TL;DR If I'm understanding these arbitration clauses correctly, then these companies can basically wriggle their way out of being responsible if something happens to me because of their equipment being wrong about a no-drive area, which it already has, and it bothers me enough to stop using the bikes/scooters entirely."

I am currently in the transfer process from my community college in Monterey. I am an international student from Germany, a history major, and in the future I'd also like to go into film.  
As many of you probably feel the same way, UCLA is definitely my dream school to transfer to. I think I would be immensely disappointed if I did not get in.

However, I am in pretty good standings with a 4.0 GPA right now, but I still have one more year to go. I am currently participating in the local student government as a director, meaning I run my own meetings and I am responsible for many campus related things. I take advantage of several projects in my area, for example a movie that is being produced over the next 6 months, and I have also been asked by the faculty staff of my CCC if I'd be interested in producing short films for the marketing department of my college, which I definitely am.

Now, this semester, I have been pretty overwhelmed with all the opportunities that were given to me. I definitely want to take part in all these projects as they are pretty much once in a lifetime opportunities.

BUT, I am unhappy with one of my classes that I take this semester. I just can't seem to get the gist of it and keep up with the workload of all my other classes. I am now worried that I'd receive my first B or possibly C in this course, which is also major related class.

I am asking myself now whether to drop this class and possibly take something else next semester.

I am worried however that a ""W"" would look bad on my transcript and significantly reduce my chances of being admitted to UCLA.

I was also wondering, up until what semester is UCLA looking at your grades? Would this Fall semester be the last one that they look at or my Spring semester next year?

Thank you all so much! I've been stressing out about the college admission process. I wish all of you a great start into the new quarter!"

i’m only really in one fairly small club right now, i used to live on a very social floor last year, so i’m kind of missing out on that this year since i’ve moved off the hill. i completely missed out on week 0 as well so i’m kinda sad about that too... it would be nice to have a group of friends again like i used to, my roommates are practically the only people i talk to anymore :/

and i’m not going to lie, i feel like i’ve been painfully lonely, miserable, and cooped up in the situation i’m in right now. i feel like i’m the loneliest and most unmotivated i’ve ever been and i’m beating myself up over it. i didn’t really get to enjoy a nice summer and my mental health has been dwindling down. yeah... i think this might be the worst my mental health has ever been. but now that i’ve got this chance to start new this year, i feel like i haven’t made any progress. i hate feeling like i’m useless and unproductive, so i’m trying to get into some clubs. so if you know any that are cool, i’d love to know!! \*also, i have checked out CAPS last year, but i didn’t really get any results i wanted. however i am going to revisit them this week to help me try to find a therapist in the area :-)

or if you don’t have any orgs to recommend, i really would love to make some new friends. i love having discussions about mental health, dismantling capitalism, indigenous peoples, and art and art history. i’m an artist myself actually so it’d be cool to be friends with other artists that go here. i also love sharing tastes in music and i like making playlists!! we can text and maybe hang out sometime. so yea, please message me if you’re interested!

thank you everyone!! things are a bit rough for me right now but i’d love to start taking steps in improving :)"

I have been looking into housing and was wondering if anyone could help me decide what would be best for me to apply/look into?

* I know there are different types of on-campus housing: Classic residential halls, Deluxe Residential halls, Residential suites and Plazas. 
* Along with University apartments: Gayley Court, Glenrock, Glenrock West, Landfair, Landfair Vista, Westwood Chateau and Westwood Palm. 
* Co-op Housing
* And general apartments near UCLA.  

My priority for housing is definitely to have a social experience. However, I am also wondering what is a financially-viable option whilst still having a “college experience?”

If anyone has heard from other exchange students about their housing experience and advice, this would also be extremely helpful!! 

Thank you so much for your help! Any advice would be appreciated J"

This is the most insane but completely non-fiction story you will ever see. It is however having trouble getting traction, and getting censored\\banned. Some of the ways this is happening are explained in the update section near the end of the document. Media is currently ignoring this story. This is an effort to create public awareness, so that bribes, blackmail, censorship, and secret deals cannot allow these vile criminals to maintain the status quo, and remain in office.

Billions in bribes were paid to Trump, Pelosi, Schumer, Harris and others to enable a Soros, Koch, and Porter funded child raping ring to operate in the USA. Below will contain excerpts from the 84 page PDF document which can be downloaded near the end of this post. **Please download** **and listen to the links below.** **Turn up the volume and put headphones on.** **You will hear these people and many other high profile people, incriminate themselves in unbelievable fashion.**

Notable attendees of this “rape party”, which occurred in Buffalo, New York, on January 14th into 15th, 2019 included: Bill DeBlasio, Andrew Cuomo, Bill Murray, Peter Buttgeig, George Soros, Barack Obama, Steve Scalise, among several others. Please be aware this footage will be difficult to listen to for most people, it is very graphic. You will hear the boys screaming and crying, some even beg for their lives. Below you will find links to some of the footage located within the **84 page PDF document**, which contains dozens of links containing completely incriminating evidence of these and many other crimes committed by high profile politicians and wealthy individuals.

Illuminati want this apartment, which has been illegally broadcasting the tenant as a “Truman Show” for over four years, as a ready made child pornography studio.

\\\\Please post this anywhere you can! Create your own posts with this or other excerpt from the PDF. This information keeps getting blocked, censored, 'down/voted' etc. These people are extremely wealthy and throw money to anyone who will help them cover up their child rapes , child murders, and corruption. This is usually done through a receivership transfer where you receive the funds after for or more day, and it can be pulled at the last second, which is usually the case after you've done them the ""service"" as they call it. Please help get the word out. Soon it will no longer be able to be ignored.

A word about the ""faggot"" usage: it was a necessary tool. It showed three things: they were not in control of the situation, if they were the usage would have been stopped. Everyone out there needed to see this, as it was contrary to the picture they were painting. Two, it made it unpleasant for them to be in the telepathic headspace \[see reference item G in the PDF\], which has obvious advantages. Three, it pointed out impersonators of B.S. in the headspace, because they would not call each other “faggot”, and in turn giving themselves away thus helping to mitigate the spread of false information. Apologies for those unintentionally offended. On that note, I give you former President Barack Obama in a foursome with Peter Thiel, Jack Dorsey, and Matthew Porter. It is on page 12 of the document where you can download the video containing audio footage of the ""event"". Link for the PDF is just above under ""Full 84 page document"".

It may work with some people, but not always.

I used to be an international student and I know all the struggles they go through (far away from families, friends, new culture, new language, the list goes on). After I graduated not so long ago, I decided to create a platform to help international students make friends at their new colleges and help them feel more comfortable.

I published my mobile app about 2-3 ago, and what I found out was quite interesting. So many local students from different universities signed up (even more than internationals), and I realized that this can be a great way for students to meet new people, make friends, go to college events together, overcome social anxiety.

I would be very happy, even if I could help one person. If anyone is interested, just comment below or send me a DM."

Anyway, she said no at first because of her busy schedule but she said she could be convinced. I had basically decided right there and then that I was not going to try to inconvenience her, and was going to give up. But she kept prodding, trying to get me to convince her and was telling me that I needed to put my water bottle down (I was fidgeting), straighten my back, and gain some confidence, and that I was never going to be able to talk to the faculty, with the way I was doing. She made these comments in the nicest way possible and I know she was just trying to give me realistic advice and have me face the truth but I couldn't help but feel like I was being insulted. I started tearing up on her and she could probably tell. Once I left her office, I immediately started hyperventilating and sobbing for 45 minutes.  People always say to visit office hours and that the professors are harmless, but after this experience, I never want to step foot in an office again. I'm obviously not prepared for university and its professionalism as I never gained an ounce of determination and self-respect over the years. My friend believes she shouldn't have talked to me that way but I guess I'm looking for others to agree with me. So if you could be on my side, that'd be amazing. Thanks for reading :-)"

And compare that to the price per vegan meal (at the non-buffet places, which is where the best vegan food is anyway):

[If you have a meal plan, you're paying at least 40&amp;#37; more than the average cash price for a vegan meal.](https://i.redd.it/qr30pcmx33r31.png)

Meal plans only make sense if (a) the vast majority of your meals are at the buffet-style dining halls (which don't generally have the best vegan food), (b) if you get meat dishes (which can be more expensive than vegan ones), or (c) if you exclusively eat Mexican Food with Impossible Meat and Rendez and you would otherwise have the non-P 19 meal plan.

Note: Most prices above don't include chips/fruit/drink, which tend to be an additional $1.50. Even if you add that to the average meal price, you're still only at $7.92 which still significantly cheaper than any meal plan.

Link to the application is here:  [https://forms.gle/hAczEAMXoxve6VCA7](https://forms.gle/hAczEAMXoxve6VCA7) 

More about the project:

Penelope is a horror video game with a claymation aesthetic that's deeply incorporated into its mechanics—the ways in which the player interacts with the characters and world around them will be directly built around the idea that everything is made out of clay. We want to dive deeply into what really scares us, and bring that up into an immersive, cohesive gaming experience. No jumpscares here, hoss; tension, suspense, and horrifying thrills are the name of this game. 

Who we're looking for:   
We're looking for 2-3 developers, 2-3  artists, and 1 music producer. Experience is appreciated but not at all necessary, as long as you have spunk! But if you do have experience in  the following, definitely slide into our DMs ;)

Developers  
  \- Object-oriented programming (think Java or C#)  
  \- Any game engines, but preferably Unity  
Artists  
  \- Illustration; preferably well-versed in digital art programs  
  \- 3D modelling, texturing, and/or rigging (in Blender or Maya)  
Music  
  \- Music composition and production 

Hope to welcome some of you to the team very soon! :\^)"

My grades are dying and I don't really know how to study or pay attention in class. Throughout high school I never paid attention in class and got by through cramming right before tests and it worked fine for me, but here I'm struggling. 

I go to all my classes and started going to office hours and asking questions but I still feel like I'm drowning. I feel like I'm physically incapable of paying attention in lecture. I try my best to listen but 5 minutes in I'm busy thinking about anything EXCEPT what the lecturer is saying, and by the time I can drag my focus back I'm completely lost and I end up just having to go self-study after class instead. It's only week 2 but I feel really overwhelmed. 

I'm still ok at self-studying but it makes going to lecture a complete waste so I might as well just skip the class, but I'm scared the professor will say something that will be tested but isn't in the textbook--except I don't actually have the ability to pay attention in lecture anyway, so it's not like I'll even hear enough to benefit from that. 

Between constantly self-studying to catch up and outside commitments I feel like I have no time to breathe and even when I sleep well I'm constantly tired. Coffee doesn't even help half the time, I just get sleepier instead.

Is something wrong with me? What can I even do?"

I am currently taking a class with a professor who is a real stickler. She won't let us use laptops for notes, can't have phones on, can't record lecture, etc. which is all fine and good but she told us that because Yom Kippur falls on one her class days (today) that she will instead have class on Friday at the same time. Moreover, because Indigenous People's Day (formerly Columbus Day something the school doesn't even consider a holiday either way) falls on a Monday on one of her classes and since she observes Indigenous People's Day, she will also be having a Friday class on that week as well. 

Can she just do that? What if people have other classes or sections on Friday or work? She even sent out an e-mail saying that the class will be really important so make it so you can attend. I feel like it would be different if she did this and allowed the recording of lecture so people who legitimately can't go can still benefit from the ""important"" lecture that she has decided to schedule for a day that no one anticipated when they signed up for her class. I guess I just don't understand how this is a reasonable position when as a professor who has been here for ages she can presumably pick her teaching days and could have had the foresight to see that picking the opposite days where there are no holidays would be better. 

Has this happened to anyone else?"

Idk what kind of crackhead energy I had during orientation to think ‘wow...chem &amp; LS sounds great’. And the worst part is I probs would have passed the exam if I wasn’t a nervous wreck. 

Idk, should I stick it through with Lavelle’s 14A or move into chem 17?? I heard I can always retake chem 14A but like, idk if med schools like that ?? Idek if I wanna do med school tbh but idk what careers are available for microbiologist w/ just a bachelors degree. 
Thanks for reading this, am currently eating Mac n cheese to feel better :’))))"

And I also need to mention that I am only speaking for myself and not for the Daily Bruin or any of my colleagues in Kerckhoff. But I digress.

What I want to talk about is the complete lack of respect for the Daily Bruin on this sub. I mean, seriously, what gives? Perhaps it's the comfort of anonymity that emboldens you all to talk the trash that you do but realize that it's honestly pathetic and sad that you're sitting there defending some idiotic block party that put people's safety and property in jeopardy; and then criticizing the only voice of reason throughout this whole fiasco. How about this? GROW UP. You people aren't in high school anymore. It's time that you take responsibility for your actions. The block party got way out of hand and you know it. 

I know a lot of you are too dense to realize that dumping trash onto the street and then walking away from it like it never happened will necessitate *someone else* picking it up *for you*, but it’s not cool and should never happen. Not only is not cool it’s egregious to the point that I’m embarrassed to be a UCLA student right now. People who heard about the block party were shocked when they found out UCLA students were acting like unsocialized and aggressive delinquents. And no, I'm not just talking about nearby wealthy residents. People from all over LA saw the story, both this latest one and the one from January that prompted a televised story from CBS Los Angeles. Thinking about it people: hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of people throughout Southern California witnessed this lunacy on the street. Is this how you want people to view UCLA??

Were some of you so privileged growing up that you can’t see the problem with this? What would your parents think of you acting like a bunch of morons on the street?

I've been reading the comments in that thread and wow, the only thing I can say is they're absurd and outrageously ignorant. They are mind bogglinglyy dumb, hilariously nonsensical and immature. I honestly can't believe that students at one of the world's elite institutions are acting like a bunch of ninth graders after their first house party. Did a bunch of frat bros brigade this sub or something? What exactly is happening here? I only speculate that is what's going on because I know there can't be such a large contingent of stupid people on here. It has to be a concerted effort on the part of the idiots who organized last week's shitshow, which I believe is coming from those in Greek life. I just can't fathom how there could be another explanation given the level of stupidity displayed here.

Do yourselves a favor and knock off the block party crap. It’s unfair to residents who want no part of it. It’s unfair to the firefighters and police who had to divert officers and resources to baby sit you on the street instead of focusing on crimes like the recent burglaries on the hill. 

For those of you who don't like the paper or our stances on issues: nobody cares. We are supposed to challenge the status quo and the common narrative. You're not supposed to agree with everything, you dolts.

And finally, learn to respect your fellow students. I know you all think we at the DB are different from you, but guess what, we’re not. We’re students too. We like to party and have a good time like anyone else. But just because we don’t act like a bunch of middle schoolers, that doesn’t mean you have free pass to say whatever bullshit you want about us without a response. We’re not against parties. But we also don’t see the problem in calling out a horde of out of control animals like a lot of you were acting like last week.

It kinda stings me that I turned down UCLA. UCLA had been my dream school, and school was beautiful af when I did a campus tour. But then I realized that the beauty of school shouldn’t be a factor. When I got into Berkeley, I toured Berkeley for the first time. I liked the campus and atmosphere too. I researched a lot about those two schools. I found that Berkeley’s program for my major is better, and I almost committed to Berkeley. Also my parents kinda wanted me to go to Cal because of their prestige, but I was afraid of their grade deflation and competitive culture. I thought of going to grad school after undergrad. Now, I am really unsure about what to do for the future. I am really lost. I thought this regret would disappear as the quarter started, but no. UCLA is an awesome school, but I think I don’t belong to here... Transfer is not an option.. I just need to admit the situation I am facing now. How do I really get over this regret..?"

I must also mention that I am only speaking for myself here; it's my personal opinion, not the graders. But I digress.

What I want to talk about is the complete lack of respect for the Computer Science department on this sub. I mean, seriously, what gives? Perhaps it's the comfort of anonymity that emboldens you all to talk the trash that you do but realize that it's honestly pathetic and sad that you're sitting there defending some idiotic Github repository that put people's coding ability and knowledge in jeopardy; and then criticizing the only voice of reason throughout this whole fiasco. How about this? GROW UP. You people aren't in PIC10A anymore. It's time that you take responsibility for your actions. The Git commits got way out of hand and you know it. I'm genuinely puzzled as to how such a ridiculous display of dynamic programming could be seen as fun. You don't have anything better to do than assign your variables as ""SuckMeProfessor"" ? Seriously, I feel sorry for you if this is your preferred form of entertainment.

I know a lot of you are too dense to realize that cheating and then walking away from it like it never happened and never responding to my emails that this will necessitate a meeting with the Dean of Students, but it’s not cool and should never happen. Not only is not cool it’s egregious to the point that I’m embarrassed to be a UCLA student right now. People who heard about our Computer Science curriculum were shocked when they learned UCLA students were acting like disturbed, stupid delinquents. And no, I'm not just talking about nearby wealthy people who get Chegg. People from all over LA heard about the story, both this latest one and the one from January that prompted a broadcast on TV from CBS Los Angeles. Think about it, people: hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of people throughout Southern California witnessed this lunacy in the sheets. Is this how you want people to view UCLA?? Do you not care about your school or its reputation? What about your own personal reputation?

Were some of you so pampered and privileged growing up that you can’t see the problem with this? If you weren't, what would your parents think about you acting like a bunch of clowns on the street?

I've been reading the comments in that thread and wow, the only thing I can say is they're absurd and outrageously ignorant. They are mind bogglingly dumb, hilariously nonsensical and immature. I honestly can't believe that students at one of the world's elite institutions are acting like a bunch of ninth graders after their build success. Did a bunch of Cog sci bros brigade this sub or something? What exactly is happening here? I only speculate that that's what's going on because I know there can't be such a large contingent of stupid people on here. It must be a concerted effort on the part of the people who organized last week's shitshow, which I believe is coming from those involved in North Campus life. I just can't fathom how there could be another explanation in light of the the level of stupidity displayed here.

Do yourselves a favor and knock off the copying crap. It’s unfair to students who want no part of it. It’s unfair to the professors and other students who never cheat; we have to use resources to baby sit you during exams instead of focusing on crimes like the recent burglaries on the hill.

For those of you who don't like Project 3 or our stances on C++: nobody cares. We are supposed to challenge the status quo and the common narrative. You're not supposed to agree with everything, you dolts.

And finally, learn to respect your fellow students. I know you all think we at the CS department are different from you, but guess what, we’re not. We’re people too. We like to read hacker news and have a good time like anyone else. But just because we don’t act like a bunch of middle schoolers, that doesn’t mean you have free pass to say whatever bullshit you want about us without a response. We’re not against parties. But we also don’t see the problem in calling out a horde of out-of-control wild animals like a lot of you were acting last week.

I'm new to this institution so I'm not sure how it is here but I have noticed gloves on the floors etc. Anyway found this statement and thought it might prove useful for someone conflicted when unsure of how to respond to a lab situation.  
""As rule, what belongs in the lab stays in the lab. This means lab books and lab coats. And washing your hands before eating. If you suspect something has been contaminated, the best thing is to treat it like hazardous waste, dispose of it accordingly, and do not bring it outside the lab/at home, etc. These are only basic safety measures. Stuff does not ""disappear"". If it evaporates, it goes somewhere else. If it reacts, you have another species to deal with. If the solvent evaporates, you are left with a product in the solid state, all the more reactive...

Can the danger/toxicity propagate to the products of a reaction ? Yes, i.g., if you prepare a [cyanohydrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanohydrin) using a toxic cyanide salt, you can still get cyanide poisoning if you are exposed to the cyanohydrin.

Ask your safety officer."""

I'm from around Northridge, and I did three years at a couple community colleges in the area before transferring here last year. I just want to know if anyone else is feeling the same way I'm feeling.

While I'm doing much better this year (living out of student housing),  going back to my family and cousins this last summer reminded me of how un-reality UCLA is. Every day I'm surrounded by thousands of random faces, and 99% of the time their faces look either neutral or depressed. What the heck? I thought this was supposed to be the fun, smart UC where all the outgoing, friendly, normal people went. It seems like most students on campus are just so rude and don't want to make any social contact. I'll hold open the door for someone, and they avoid eye contact and don't say anything. People will literally turn their head and stare at the imaginary bird flying by if they see you are going to walk past them on an empty path. Even in Week 1, people look like they put so much artificial pressure on themselves academically, and it's such a buzzkill. Literally all my roommates last year, all transfers, stayed inside like 90% of the day and just played Fortnite and League of Legends. In my bio classes, everyone constantly complains about GPA, grades, how much life sucks, but that's supposed to be a joke, apparently. Nope, not really, because then they go and complain about how CAPS is terrible. I'm just sick of this culture of ""meme"" negativity. It's really obnoxious and just wears down on you as time goes on. Stop acting like you're having the time of your life if you are miserable. You're not tricking anyone but yourself, and it's paper thin. It's like people here would prefer to marinate in their own sorrows than work towards fixing their issues.

My professors my first year were mostly god-awful and had zero passion for teaching. I hated knowing that my parents were spending more than $35,000 a year to put me through a school where the students in my 9 AM class were more exited than the professors. In addition, getting research positions has been an absolute bitch. It's amazing how they go on and on about they're the ""TOP PUBLIC RESEARCH UNIVERSITY!!!"" but then it's like the damn Hunger Games to actually secure a position.

Finally, the clubs. Every time someone says they're lonely and posts on this sub, what the robotic answer always given? ""JOIN A CLUB!"" Well, from the 4 clubs I've tried going to so far, it seems that unless you're Asian, like dance teams (see Category 1), want to hang around obnoxious pre-professional students who act like a 92% on a fucking 12 point quiz is going to jeopardize their chances of med school) the obnoxious, cringeworthy student politics of an ethnic club, then have fun being alone all the time! Hopefully you meet someone cool in your absolutely massive upper-division classes. Yeah, that's not a typo. I say all of this from the experience of being in most of those clubs for a while.

Now that I'm in my senior year, I'm admittedly much happier, as I have gotten used to the situation and have found some okay friends. I still feel like there's a big gap in my ""college"" self, like I still need to do something big, but it's much better. Developing stronger connections with my family over the phone and getting their constant support is a great way to reconnect with reality, and remind myself that this dystopian, grade-obsessed ""California Paradise :)))))))"" is only temporary, and that I have a life after this. Knowing I have so many people at home who live me and see me almost like some academic soldier really helps me push through and want to set an example for all my little cousins, and my little sister in CC. The only thing that makes going to this traffic-filled, hot, smoggy freakshow is that I'll have a shiny, brand-name degree after it. Now I'll know never to chase prestige again, and to always consider personal fit first.

If you read this far, thank you, and please share your thoughts! :]"

I must also mention that I am only speaking for myself here; it's my personal opinion, not the housing department's. But I digress.

What I want to talk about is the complete lack of respect for fire alarm drills on this sub. I mean, seriously, what gives? Perhaps it's the comfort of anonymity that emboldens you all to talk the trash that you do but realize that it's honestly pathetic and sad that you're sitting there defending your inane desire to sleep at the expense of putting people's safety and property in jeopardy; and then criticizing the only voice of reason throughout this whole fiasco. How about this? GROW UP. You people aren't in high school anymore. It's time that you take responsibility for your actions. Sleep is for the weak and you know it. I'm genuinely puzzled as to how such a ridiculous display of laziness can seem acceptable. You don't have anything better to do than lie on your bed and do nothing? Seriously, I feel sorry for you if this is your preferred form of rest.

I know a lot of you are too dense to realize that sleeping through a fire means your burning body will fuel the flames that damage other people's property, but it’s not cool and should never happen. Not only is not cool it’s egregious to the point that I’m embarrassed to be a UCLA student right now. People who heard about your desire to sleep were shocked when they learned UCLA students were acting like unsocialized, lazy slothes. And no, I'm not just talking about nearby wealthy residents. People from all over LA heard about the story, both this latest one and the one from January that prompted a broadcast on TV from CBS Los Angeles. Think about it, people: hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of people throughout Southern California witnessed this lack of industriousness in our dorms. Is this how you want people to view UCLA?? Do you not care about your school or its reputation? What about your own personal reputation?

Were some of you so pampered and privileged growing up that you can’t see the problem with this? If you weren't, what would your parents think about you sleeping every night like some sort of impotent wastrel?

I've been reading the comments in that thread and wow, the only thing I can say is they're absurd and outrageously ignorant. They are mind bogglinglyy dumb, hilariously nonsensical and immature. I honestly can't believe that students at one of the world's elite institutions are acting like a bunch of ninth graders after their first sleepover. Did a bunch of narcoleptics brigade this sub or something? What exactly is happening here? I only speculate that that's what's going on because I know there can't be such a large contingent of stupid people on here. It must be a concerted effort on the part of the people who opposed last week's fire drill, which I believe is coming from those involved in Melatonin trafficking. I just can't fathom how there could be another explanation in light of the the level of stupidity displayed here.

Do yourselves a favor and knock off the sleeping crap. It’s unfair to residents who want no part of it. It’s unfair to the firefighters and police who had to divert officers and resources to baby sit you on the street instead of focusing on crimes like the recent burglaries on the hill.

For those of you who don't like the housing department and our fire alarms: nobody cares. We are supposed to challenge the status quo and the common narrative. You're not supposed to agree with everything, you dolts.

And finally, learn to respect your fellow students. I know you all think we at the RAs are different from you, but guess what, we’re not. We’re students too. We like to occasionally close our eyes like anyone else. But just because we don’t act like a bunch of middle schoolers, that doesn’t mean you have free pass to say whatever bullshit you want about us without a response. We’re not against closing your eyes for 5 minutes everyday. But we also don’t see the problem in calling out a horde of out-of-control narcoleptics like a lot of you were acting last week.

Do yourselves a favor, keep it on the street and out of the dorms when the fire alarm sounds. This whole complaining about fire alarms thing is so lame and overdone."

DO NOT sign yourself up for these. Professors and TA’s aren’t going to come around collecting names and phone numbers for a review session—they don’t need that. You have no idea who you’re giving your information to. Lavelle caught one of these handouts going around his lecture last year and claimed he and his teaching staff had nothing to do with it and warned against it—nobody was willing to step forward to claim it as if they were from a tutoring service/club either. I recently saw the paper handout going around again this year.

Exercise the same caution you would in any other situation. UCLA’s an open campus so you can’t assume that any sign-up sheet getting passed around in class is legitimate. Don’t fall for it."

1) It takes exactly 3 full pumps to fill up a sauce container. (If you’re putting a lid on a ketchup container though only put 2.5 pumps as the ketchup is less viscous than the other sauces and overfilling will result in oozing out the sides.)

2) If you like ranch and buffalo sauce, try combining them in the same container. Exactly 1 full pump buffalo + 2 full pumps ranch will yield the most exquisite buffalo ranch sauce you’ve ever had *muah*

Note: full pump means from the pumps natural resting position all the way to the bottom in one single, smooth motion. 

Am I a loser for caring this much about sauce? Probably. If you have any other “De Neve Late Night Life Hacks” drop ‘em here."

I must also mention that I am only speaking for myself here; it's my personal opinion, not the fast walker community as a whole. But I digress.

What I want to talk about is the complete lack of respect for fast walkers on this sub. I mean, seriously, what gives? Perhaps it's the comfort of anonymity that emboldens you all to talk the trash that you do but realize that it's honestly pathetic and sad that you're sitting there defending some idiotic slow walkers that put people's safety and promptness in jeopardy; and then criticizing the only voice of reason throughout this whole fiasco. How about this? GROW UP. You people aren't in high school anymore. It's time that you take responsibility for your actions. The slow walkers on campus have gotten way out of hand and you know it. I'm genuinely puzzled as to how such a ridiculous display of lethargy could be seen as acceptable. You don't have anything better to do than slow down students trying to get to class? Seriously, I feel sorry for you if this is your preferred form of transportation.

I know a lot of you are too dense to realize that walking slowly on the street and then speeding up like it never happened will necessitate someone else slowing down because of you, but it’s not cool and should never happen. Not only is not cool it’s egregious to the point that I’m embarrassed to be a UCLA student right now. People who heard about slow walkers were shocked when they learned UCLA students were acting like unsocialized, oblivious delinquents. And no, I'm not just talking about nearby wealthy residents. People from all over LA heard about the story, both the latest ones and the ones from January that prompted a broadcast on TV from CBS Los Angeles. Think about it, people: hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of people throughout Southern California witnessed this lunacy on campus. Is this how you want people to view UCLA?? Do you not care about your school or its reputation? What about your own personal reputation?

Were some of you so pampered and privileged growing up that you can’t see the problem with this? If you weren't, what would your parents think about you acting like a bunch of clowns on the street?

I've been reading the comments in that thread and wow, the only thing I can say is they're absurd and outrageously ignorant. They are mind bogglinglyy dumb, hilariously nonsensical and immature. I honestly can't believe that students at one of the world's elite institutions are acting like a bunch of ninth graders after their first walk to class. Did a bunch of paraplegics brigade this sub or something? What exactly is happening here? I only speculate that that's what's going on because I know there can't be such a large contingent of stupid people on here. It must be a concerted effort on the part of the people who participated in last week's shitshow, which I believe is coming from those involved in the slow walkers club. I just can't fathom how there could be another explanation in light of the the level of stupidity displayed here.

Do yourselves a favor and knock off the slow walking crap. It’s unfair to residents who want no part of it. It’s unfair to the firefighters and police who had to divert officers and resources to avoid you on the street instead of focusing on getting to crime scenes like the recent burglaries on the hill.

For those of you who don't like the fast walker community or our stances on issues: nobody cares. We are supposed to challenge the status quo and the common narrative. You're not supposed to agree with everything, you dolts.

And finally, learn to respect your fellow students. I know you all think we at the FWC are different from you, but guess what, we’re not. We’re students too. We like to walk and have a good time like anyone else. But just because we don’t act like a bunch of middle schoolers, that doesn’t mean you have free pass to say whatever bullshit you want about us without a response. We’re not against walking. But we also don’t see the problem in calling out a horde of out-of-control wild animals like a lot of you were acting last week.

Do yourselves a favor, keep it indoors and off the street. This whole slow walking thing is so lame and overdone."

I really hope you will read it. I welcome disagreement.

&amp;#x200B;

I will preface this post by saying that after considerable introspection, I have determined that I am in fact an academic elitist. I am majoring in the social sciences, and I have become preoccupied with the concept of academic pedigree, and with examining if the prestige accorded to UCLA and to the student body is warranted. My mind is constantly engaged in analysis of the campus, and is always assessing the character and quality of work being done by the undergraduate student population. Questions I ask myself on a regular basis are: How are these students different from California State University students? How does their work ethic and aptitude compare to that of the general undergraduate student population of California? Would I be able to tell these students apart from CSULA kids or from local CC kids if they were put into a classroom together?

&amp;#x200B;

Admittedly, this may seem like an entitled and vain thought process. However, I'd argue that elitism pervades every sector of the undergraduate student population at UCLA. This is never explicitly communicated by students, but the MAJORITY of students on campus have learned to commodify their UCLA attendance, and to use UCLA apparel to signal to society at large their academic pedigree and professional trajectory. If we are honest with ourselves: Most UCLA students will capitalize on the school's brand power to the fullest extent possible. This preoccupation with pedigree is common to most undergraduate students at UCLA, and it is what motivates the ranking competition with Berkeley. 

&amp;#x200B;

The memes are very funny, but we cannot in good faith argue that they were produced solely with comedic intent. UCLA students are keenly aware of their position in the academic hierarchy, and welcome with open arms any reputation boost conferred upon the school that will further strengthen the brand power of UCLA and, consequently, the significance of their apparel. This is why most students monitor the rankings. #1. #1. #1. This is the number that our meme pages are fixated on. Is it really only in good fun, or does this number inform the sense of self-worth held by the undergraduate student body?

&amp;#x200B;

I'll get to the point. I question whether North Campus students have earned this reputation. All it takes is a cursory analysis of the time spent on academics by North Campus majors to determine their lack of a studying culture. Observing my floor, my classes, and all areas of North Campus, I do not detect any urgency in their academic work. What then differentiates these students from the students of CSULA, or from Santa Monica College? If their time allocated to academics is a mere couple of hours a day (this by far seems to be the average for North Campus majors) and even those two hour intervals of study are not particularly rigorous, and usually include skimming over readings while checking social media/bullshitting with friends, what distinguishes the UCLA student from the CC student? The only possibility that would prove North Campus majors to be worthy of the school's name is that owing to their natural aptitude, they produce extraordinary work during those brief time intervals. Is this what earns them the UCLA name? Are they producing publish-ready critiques of their Sociology and English texts during those two hour windows of time? I think the obvious reality is that they are not. They are only satisfying already lax course requirements.

&amp;#x200B;

I can only speak for my dorm, but I have strong reason to believe that my dorm is representative of the general student body. In the UCLA social sciences and humanities, there is not a true yearning for intellectual development like what is found at the University of Chicago. When I say intellectual development, I'm not referring to obnoxious kids who like to namedrop Plato for brownie points. What I mean is that I have met few kids who will read Econ or Poli Sci books even if they don't have to. Neither is there a competitive pre-professional atmosphere like that found at the University of Pennsylvania, where kids are dominating and hit the ground running competing for top-tier finance and consulting jobs. I have found that North Campus majors delude themselves into believing that they have a work hard, play hard mentality. However, the reality seems to be that they play very hard, and work very little. 

The conclusion I have come to is that STEM students are the only segment of the undergraduate population which must  consistently demonstrate value and competency. I admire so much the sink or swim pressure which looms over every hard science STEM major. The grueling curriculum makes each A a validation of worth for the STEM major. The hours and energy sacrificed for a higher purpose is something I wish I had, but it is too late now unless I want to add more time and debt to my degree. The CS graduates will carry the name of our school on their backs when they land jobs at FB, Google, etc. Top of the class pre-meds will carry the name of our school when they enter their first year at John Hopkins and Duke Med. Aerospace engineers will carry the name of our school when they work for Lockheed, Boeing, and the Gov. While I fear only the top .5%, the elite of the elite of the graduating class of North Campus, will validate our school's name.

I must also mention that I am not speaking for myself here; it's an objective fact that Bing was not banned in China. But I digress.

What I want to talk about is the complete lack of respect for virtual private machines on this sub. I mean, seriously, what gives? Perhaps it's the comfort of anonymity that emboldens you all to talk the trash that you do but realize that it's honestly pathetic and sad that you're sitting there defending some idiotic undergraduates that think they’re well-researched and smart; and then criticizing the only voice of reason throughout this whole fiasco who *actually* knows any better. How about this? GROW UP. You people aren't in high school anymore. It's time that you take responsibility for your actions. The uneducated on campus have gotten way out of hand and you know it. I'm genuinely puzzled as to how such a ridiculous display of disinformation could be seen as acceptable. You don't have anything better to do than to spread the idea that Bing was banned in China? Seriously, I feel sorry for you if this is your preferred form of fake news.

I know a lot of you are too dense to realize that not renting a virtual machine will make you an inferior, uneducated human being, but it’s not cool and should never happen. Not only is not cool it’s egregious to the point that I’m embarrassed to be a UCLA TA right now. People who heard about Bing *not* being banned in China were shocked when they learned that China actually has *the best* internet protocols and list of allowed websites in the world. And no, I'm not just talking about Bing. People from all over the world heard about the story, both the latest ones and the ones from January that prompted a broadcast on TV from CBS Los Angeles. Think about it, people: hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of people throughout Southern California witnessed this lunacy on campus. Is this how you want people to view UCLA?? Do you not care about your school or its reputation? What about your own personal reputation?

Were some of you so pampered and privileged growing up that you can’t see the problem with this? If you weren't, what would your parents think about you acting like a bunch of clowns on your internet browsers?

I've been reading the comments in that thread and wow, the only thing I can say is they're absurd and outrageously ignorant. They are mind bogglinglyy dumb, hilariously nonsensical and immature. I honestly can't believe that students at one of the world's elite institutions are acting like a bunch of ninth graders after their first walk to class. Did a bunch of uneducated undergraduates brigade this sub or something? What exactly is happening here? I only speculate that that's what's going on because I know there can't be such a large contingent of people without virtual machines. It must be a concerted effort on the part of the people who haven’t purchased a virtual machine yet, which I believe is coming from those dumb enough to believe Bing was banned in China. I just can't fathom how there could be another explanation in light of the the level of stupidity displayed here.

Do yourselves a favor and knock off the CS 35L crap. It’s unfair to residents who want no part of it. It’s unfair to the Chinese internet cyber police who had to divert officers and resources to correct this misinformation instead of focusing on making sure Overwatch streamers are banned for making statements about China’s fair and unbiased policies.

For those of you who don't like the educated community or our stances on issues: nobody cares. We are supposed to challenge the status quo and the common narrative. You're not supposed to agree with everything, you dolts.

And finally, learn to respect your fellow students. I know you all think we the CS 35L TAs are different from you, but guess what, we’re not. We’re students too. We like to surf the internet and have a good time like anyone else. But just because we don’t act like a bunch of middle schoolers, that doesn’t mean you have free pass to say whatever Bing propaganda you want about us without a response. We’re not against Bing, or your lack of research. But we also don’t see the problem in calling out a horde of out-of-control wild animals like a lot of you were acting last week.

Do yourselves a favor, buy a virtual machine and learn the truth for yourself. This whole “Bing was banned in China” thing is so lame and overdone. *Bing was not banned in China*."

Like wtf man, it’s not my fault I got here before you. For Christ sake, let me do my business in peace. I understand pulling the handle to check if it’s locked, but that’s not what I’m talking about. I’m referring to those who go above and beyond to be dickheads by yanking and pushing the door in frustration so as to communicate their disapproval of me being in there. One person even punched the door once and walked off! Wtf!

I know the big stall is the most popular stall because of the privacy and space it affords, but don’t be a such a child about not being able to access it when it’s occupied. Use another stall dickhead!! Very rarely are all 4 stalls on my floor’s bathroom in use at once. So, I know for a fact there are always other stalls available. And second, how dumb must you be to not to figure out the world’s easiest hack to determine if someone is in the big stall: check to see whether the lock is engaged! I know the little open slit between the door and its closing is narrow, but if you pay close attention you can clearly see a difference between a locked and open stall. The locked door has as a rectangular dark spot where the handle is: that’s the shadow of the lock and it means the lock is engaged and someone’s in there; whereas an open door will display empty space all the way down the crack. You can argue that this a detail too small for everyone to notice, but my vision is terrible and I was still able to figure it out fast. The fact that the large stall is visible from the end of the bathroom means you can catch this detail from a distance without ever needing to display your rude aggression.

Honestly, I’m not only annoyed because I’m in in there taking a shit, I do other stuff too. I wouldn’t ordinarily admit this but, since I’m so fed up, I’ll be honest and say that 40% of the time I’m in there masturbating. Before you give me any shit, I’d like to defend myself by saying I live in a friggin’ triple in Gardenia so beating off in my room is out of the question because my annoying roommate is constantly in there on the phone with his gf in Thailand. And when he’s out, my other roommate is on the bunk above me taking a nap. That means my own bed is out of the question. I rarely get the place to myself—especially at night when I usually get the urge to burp the worm. And let’s be real here: jerking it in the shower is also uncomfortable. Like who wants to beat off when they’re standing up? You would never beat off standing up in your room when you’re alone; it's awkward. Why the hell would you do it when you’re dripping wet and have class in 15 minutes and have to scrub your ass at the same time? That means the shower and my room are out as options: the only place I have left is the bathroom stall.

Put yourselves in my shoes and imagine when I’m in there on Xvideos on my phone, with only one of my earphones in ear because I have to try to focus and enjoy what I’m looking at and doing while simultaneously needing to be very alert with my other ear open to anybody who may walk in and hear me. Somebody pushing on that door in an annoyed manner is enough to disrupt my flow and even kill my boner. This has happened several times. And I wouldn’t complain about it for a single second if someone was genuinely trying to check the door. Because then I’d just chalk it up to an expected risk of doing my dirty deed in the bathroom. And for the most part, most people just quickly check the door with a light tug and then walk to the next stall. But that’s not what I’m talking about. It’s the small but vocal minority, the petulant and rude folks who push and pull on the door in an openly passive aggressive manner while jeering and scoffing in an indignant way as I did something to personally offend them. I’ve had enough of their crap.

Before you claim that I’m in there for too long, save it. I’m never in there for more than 5-10 minutes, which I believe is perfectly reasonable for anybody to be in a stall whether they’re taking a dump or stroking it.

And no, I’m not just writing this as a shit post, I’m genuinely peeved by this. It’s like every time I’m in there some dummy will come and pull violently on the door and then complain out loud about the door being locked. That annoys me if I’m taking a shit. But frustrates me to the 10th effing degree when I’m trying to pleasure myself. It’s hard enough needing to be quiet and discreet when I’m in there doing a little hand to gland combat, not to mention holding in any groans of pleasure, without having some big ugly brute banging on the door  and jeering when the stall is clearly occupied.

I understand many of you may think it is disgusting and obscene for me to do this, but I use a seat cover and clean up every time. So, I don’t really see a problem with anybody doing it as long as it’s so discrete it’s virtually undetectable. There are worse things in life than having a threesome with a couple of no-shows in a bathroom stall. But that’s an argument for a different time. I think for the most part, most of you, guy or girl, should relate to this if it’s happened to you because it mostly happens to those taking a dump. And we all have to do that.

Look, we all deserve a little alone time without putting up with petty passive aggressiveness. So for all you bathroom stall divas: take a chill pill and WAIT YOUR TURN.

dhy8kc,My biggest communal bathroom pet peeve,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/dhy8kc/my_biggest_communal_bathroom_pet_peeve/,TexasSenior18,36,2019-10-14 15:26:22,12,/r/ucla/comments/dhy8kc/my_biggest_communal_bathroom_pet_peeve/,NaN,"I don’t know if all bathroom stalls are laid out how they’re laid out in buildings like Gardenia, Holly, and maybe even Sproul Cove/Landing since they’re all built similarly… but I must say that it’s pretty freakin’ annoying when I go into the largest stall, the one at the end whose door faces you as you walk toward it, and some dickwad walks up while I’m in there doing my business and pushes on the door violently and then huffs and puffs, snickers and sneers to themselves about me being in there. Like wtf man, it’s not my fault I got here before you. For Christ sake, let me do my business in peace. I understand pulling the handle to check if it’s locked, but that’s not what I’m talking about. I’m referring to those who go above and beyond to be dickheads by yanking and pushing the door in frustration to as to communicate their disapproval with me being in there. One person even punched the door once and walked off! Wtf!

I know the big stall is the most popular stall because of the privacy and space it affords, but don’t be a such a child about not being able to access it when it’s occupied. Use another stall dickhead!! Very rarely are all 4 stalls on my floor’s bathroom in use at once. So, I know for a fact there are always other stalls available. And second, how dumb must you be to not to figure out the world’s easiest hack to determine if someone is in the big stall: check to see whether the lock is engaged! I know the little open slit between the door and its closing is narrow, but if you pay close attention you can clearly see a difference between a locked and open stall. The locked door has as a rectangular dark spot where the handle is: that’s the shadow of the lock and it means the lock is engaged and someone’s in there; whereas an open door will display empty space all the way down the crack. You can argue that this a detail too small for everyone to notice, but my vision is terrible and I was still able to figure it out fast. The fact that the large stall is visible from the end of the bathroom means you can catch this detail from a distance without ever needing to display your rude aggression.

Honestly, I’m not only annoyed because I’m in in there taking a shit, I do other stuff too. I wouldn’t ordinarily admit this but, since I’m so fed up, I’ll be honest and say that 40% of the time I’m in there masturbating. Before you give me any shit, I’d like to defend myself by saying I live in a friggin’ triple in Gardenia so beating off in my room is out of the question because my annoying roommate is constantly in there on the phone with his gf in Thailand. And when he’s out, my other roommate is on the bunk above me taking a nap. That means my own bed is out of the question. I rarely get the place to myself—especially at night when I usually get the urge to burp the worm. And let’s be real here: jerking it in the shower is also uncomfortable. Like who wants to beat off when they’re standing up? You would never beat off standing up in your room when you’re alone; it's awkward. Why the hell would you do it when you’re dripping wet and have class in 15 minutes and have to scrub your ass at the same time? That means the shower and my room are out as options: the only place I have left is the bathroom stall.

Put yourselves in my shoes and imagine when I’m in there on Xvideos on my phone, with only one of my earphones in ear because I have to try to focus and enjoy what I’m looking at and doing while simultaneously needing to be very alert with my other ear open to anybody who may walk in and hear me. Somebody pushing on that door in an annoyed manner is enough to disrupt my flow and even kill my boner. This has happened several times. And I wouldn’t complain about it for a single second if someone was genuinely trying to check the door. Because then I’d just chalk it up to an expected risk of doing my dirty deed in the bathroom. And for the most part, most people just quickly check the door with a light tug and then walk to the next stall. But that’s not what I’m talking about. It’s the small but vocal minority, the petulant and rude folks who push and pull on the door in an openly passive aggressive manner while jeering and scoffing in an indignant way as I did something to personally offend them. I’ve had enough of their crap.

Before you claim that I’m in there for too long, save it. I’m never in there for more than 5-10 minutes, which I believe is perfectly reasonable for anybody to be in a stall whether they’re taking a dump or stroking it.

And no, I’m not just writing this as a shit post, I’m genuinely peeved by this. It’s like every time I’m in there some dummy will come and pull violently on the door and then complain out loud about the door being locked. That annoys me if I’m taking a shit. But frustrates me to the 10th effing degree when I’m trying to pleasure myself. It’s hard enough needing to be quiet and discreet when I’m in there doing a little hand to gland combat, not to mention holding in any groans of pleasure, without having some big ugly brute banging on the door and audibly jeering when the stall is clearly occupied.

I understand many of you may think it is disgusting and obscene for me to do this, but I use a seat cover and clean up every time. So, I don’t really see a problem with anybody doing it as long as it’s so discrete it’s virtually undetectable. There are worse things in life than having a threesome with a couple of no-shows in a bathroom stall. But that’s an argument for a different time. I think for the most part, most of you, guy or girl, should relate to this if it’s happened to you because it mostly happens to those taking a dump. And we all have to do that.

Look, we all deserve a little alone time without putting up with petty passive aggressiveness. So for all you bathroom stall divas: take a chill pill and WAIT YOUR TURN. I know it's midterms season and you’re frustrated by all the work you have assigned, but don’t take it out on others—especially don’t take it out on the stall doors or the innocent bystander in there. Because I’ll be out in just a minute.

Thanks!"

* Thanks to a $20 million grant from the Bedari Foundation – a private family foundation that aims to encourage “…people to connect more deeply with themselves, their community and with nature” – the Bedari Kindness Institute will start running immediately. It is hoped that research conducted at the institute will create opportunities to translate the science of kindness into real-world practices. 
* The institute will provide funding for projects that study how the inner workings of the human mind lead to kindness, and how these mechanisms can be harnessed to create more humane societies. For example, UCLA psychologists are currently delving into the impact that kind living can have in improving moods and reducing depressive symptoms.

I'm looking to get a move-in date for an apartment in early december (at least a few days before the 18th - I already booked christmas flights back to family, and am looking to get moved in before I fly back for that). My advisor can fly me out for a week to find an apartment and help set up the new lab in early november, which to my understanding is about how far in advance you want to apartment hunt in LA. I have a lot of questions to this end:

Do you guys think it would be better to hunt during the week of Nov. 3rd, or Nov. 10th?

Where's the best place to find a roommate? I'm in a bit of a tricky situation with this one. For the first 6ish months, I would be a non-full time trans woman still going by my old name, and sometime during the first year I would be looking to go full time. Maybe I'm being overly cautious (I grew up in north carolina, did my undergrad in virginia), but I need to make sure whoever I'm rooming with is going to be alright with that. It's tricky to use social media (like the facebook page) for this purpose as I can't be direct in posts without outing myself to extended family

Any tips for apartment complexes? I'm looking for a place that has a rent &lt;1300/person (preferably closer to 1100) that has a good amount of available bussing to UCLA campus, as I won't have a car. Grocery stores and such located nearby would also be a huge plus. So far what I've been looking at is the area that the University Apartments South complexes are located - I applied too late to have any chance in the housing lottery, but even without going through the university there seem to be a good number of two bedroom apartments in that area that are within my price range.

Other nice things would be if washer/dryer were located as nearby as possible (I think that in LA in-unit ones are pretty much impossible at my price point, but on the same floor would be great. Per building would also be fine, but I would really prefer to avoid needing a separate location for laundry), and if the lease/sublet was monthly as that would make it a lot easier to potentially switch into cheaper university-affiliated housing in the future.

I don't really care about roommate gender. Past experience with my current, male roommate suggests that the whole bras and boobs thing can be awkward for guys to live with. I'm pretty quiet most of the time (headphones not speakers, etc), my room is often messy, but I keep common spaces relatively clean. I tend to clean in bursts. I'm fine with alcohol / marijuana as long as it's non-smoking. I myself don't drink very often (around once per 1/2 months in the past) but have been known to get fairly drunk at times, and would probably want to try (legal) marijuana at one point or another. I'm not a fan of parties, but would be fine as long as I had a bit of notice.

If you have any tips at all for getting a good apartment for not too much money, or know someone that's subletting a space or looking to move into a new one this december, please let me know!"

I was one of those students before and I took this class so I thought i'd tell you guys how it went for me. 

First off, I got a perfect score on the final (over the summer there is only a final and no midterm, and this one exam is worth 40% of your entire grade) and yet I ended w/ a B. everyone said to take it during the summer cuz it's supposedly easier, but I'd only suggest doing that if you are an excellent writer. I actually always thought I was pretty good at writing, I've never gotten anything below an A in any of my papers throughout several years in college thus far. But my self-confidence in my writing skills is completely shattered now cuz of psych 100b. 

During the summer, the lab is worth way more points than usual, it goes 60/40 in favor of lab, while during the school years it's vice versa. I wish I took it during the school year cuz the test was not nearly as bad as everyone on Bruinwalk said, and those extra points would've helped me a lot, cuz again I essentially got a 100% in lecture. Also, during the summer, keep in mind that the pace is accelerated like crazy. The thing was, we would be assigned a big project on a thursday, and it would be due on tuesday- problem was there wasn't a single OH available in b/w those days and my TA was very bad at responding to emails. This was a very annoying problem to have for a class like this cuz everything is so arbitrary and the instructions to assignments are not clear. I swear they keep things vague and confusing on purpose or something. You'll know what I mean once you take the class- but basically almost every element to whatever instructions you get, or the ""guidelines"" to the first and second submissions are really up to interpretation. So thus due to my TA's lack of ability to respond to emails and lack of OH in b/w having something assigned and due, I would essentially be shooting from the hip on a lot of things. There's no minimum page or maximum page limit either, at least having that would've been nice so you have some gauge in how much details need to be written. There'd be instances where I'd write things the T.A. said to do, and she would still mark me off. She would even mark me off for something that would literally be addressed the next sentence, it's like she barely read my paper or something. 

The grading of these papers is very, very arbitrary. Sometimes your T.A. will mark off minute details while forgetting to mark off other parts of your paper w/ similar mistakes. Also, the first and second submissions are the biggest component to your lab grade, and they build off each other. I did not even get my first submission back until a day or two before the second and final submission was due, so I pretty much had no idea if a lot of the ideas I was writing were even accurate. From what I understand, this is usually not an issue during the regular quarter cuz everything is spaced out, and you have weeks to do assignments we have days to complete.

Oh and a big part of your lab grade is going to be your group. I had a pretty shitty group so that sucked- one person seemed to not care about anything while the other pretended to care while writing BS. So there's going to be a lot of luck involved in this class. 

Bottom line is, the material to the class is not difficult but it is poorly structured imo. I feel like they should be giving more clear instructions to the assignments, and either eliminate the group element or change the structure of it. I understand that obviously in the future many of our careers are going to involve the ability to work in groups, but I feel like for a 6 unit class like this where your grade is so important, they should allow grades to be decided by the individual. But hey, that's just my 2-cents. I also wanted to write this post so that others may be more mindful of taking this class over the summer. It seems like the general consensus among psych majors is ""take 100b over the summer, it's going to be easier!"" but it is entirely subjective and depends on your strengths and weaknesses as a student. If any of you out there have some questions or want to know more details (like the T.A. I had or grades to specific assignments) pm me, I didn't wanna write out too many details to maintain anonymity."

I tried making 3 bags for compost/recycle/trash, but what goes in which bag? In particular, the following items confuse me:

* Rendevous ""papery"" boxes, are these compostable or recyclable??
* Study boxes for things like waffles, they look even paperier? I assume the plastic top goes in recycle?
* Bags for chips/popcorn have to be thrown out, right? (Does this mean UCLA will get rid of them within a year to be ""100% eco-friendly by 2020"")
* Cardboard pizza boxes...I figured these were compostable but apparently you're supposed to take them apart and recycle them? According to a sign on the trash chute
* If there's a significant amount of food in any of the above doesn't that make them non-recyclable? 
* Receipts/classwork is paper so it definitely gets recycled??? Right??
* Technically the big black trash bags aren't compostable so can I really drop a bag full of compostable items down the compost chute??? Doesn't this defeat the entire point

This shit is hella confusing so if someone has it figured out and could help that'd be great. Or i could just go back to murdering planet earth like students on every other college campus do"

Who are the most approachable professors and TA’s to get to know in the film department that can help me with applying?

I don't want you guys to read all this and think ""damn I should've used this time better"". That's not my point and I'll try to go straight to the point, if possible. Sometimes I do admit I'll have to take a long detour, and it will be up to you to decide if you should keep on track or not.

&amp;#x200B;

As UCLA students you might think, if thinking is something you include as part of your daily reflection time fo the day, what's the purpose, or goal if that word suits you better, of going to a good (even though everything is relative and other ways of self education are decent) college and myself, as a Bruin, ask that question several times, at least five or six, maybe seven some days when I'm nostalgic, sometimes more than once per hour even. It's interesting the role of college in our lives and we can't deny it takes a toll on our mind or brain, with the passing of the years. It's totally worth it but sometimes it's not and even if it's not worth it, going to college is one of the things every person in their young life should at least consider and if they don't, well that's up to them, who am I to judge, right.

&amp;#x200B;

So what I wanted to tell you guys, now that you are studying for your midterms, is that an exam is exactly that, an exam, and if you are looking for some sort of strategy, well, in college there are a lot of them but I don't want to spend more of your time when you clearly should be studying, but I do want to say that it's important to at least consider everything we just discussed and even though I did them most of the talking, you as a reader are also an active mind and I am sure your take on this is as important and relevant as mine.

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this and I wish you the best, or not if that's not what you are aiming for in this life."

&amp;#x200B;

My on campus job hasn't paid me for the past four weeks. The reason for the late pay is for some bullshit reason on behalf of HR, so I can't and won't blame my boss for this shit. But I've been out of money for the past two weeks. I owe my friends money because I needed to pay for gas to get to my two unpaid internships. I'd be saving money if I had a parking pass on campus so I wouldn't have to park so far north. But UCLA won't give me a pass because ""my off-campus internships are not sources of income"" and for that reason I don't qualify for parking. It's like Sunglass Hut refusing to sell me sunglasses cuz I walked in on a fucking foggy day.

I'm sitting here in class right now unable to concentrate because of all of this. I have no money. I have so many responsibilities I'm juggling at once. My professor barely speaks speaks English and we're learning difficult mathematical concepts. I have a paper due next week for a GE class that has no relevance for the career I want to have. I have so much pressure to deal with, which I am capable of doing, but UCLA keeps dishing me so much fucking unnecessary bullshit that everything is way harder than it truly needs to be. I can't even imagine what it's like for other Bruins who have less money that me. I truly feel inferior to them; they are persevering and overcoming the obstacles of REAL financial stress and I am unable to do so myself.

Yes, I signed up for all of this by choosing to go to college. But fairly said, UCLA fucking sucks because of all of the flaws that come with running such a big system. And fuck my professor. Yes, I should put my laptop away so I can try to pay attention but I'm TRIPPIN right now because of actual life issues... and I'm supposed to go to class and try to decipher this lady's English. We're at such an amazing institution and I can't even understand my professor. LIT. And I've had professors like this before. Fuck all of my friends who are going to easy colleges and enjoying themselves. I'm so jealous of them. I want that so badly right now. But I realize I need to keep pushing and stay levelheaded because UCLA will give me fantastic opportunities later in life...

But fuck the hoes.
Tell me if anyone can relate.

My frat hasn't gotten me enough pussy for the past four weeks. The reason for the dry run is for some bullshit reason on behalf of sister sorority, so I can't and won't blame my big bro for this shit. But I've been out of pussy for the past two weeks. I owe my friends money because I needed to pay for gas to get to my two stripclubs out in beverly hills. I'd be saving money if I had a pussy pass on campus so I wouldn't have to chase hoes so far north. But UCLA won't give me a pass because ""my off-campus stripclubs are not sources of pussy"" and for that reason I don't qualify for pussy. It's like Sunglass Hut refusing to sell me sunglasses cuz I walked in on a fucking foggy day.
I'm sitting here in class right now unable to concentrate because of all of this. I have no pussy. I have so many balls I'm juggling at once. My professor barely speaks speaks English and we're learning difficult pimiping concepts. I have a paper due next week for a GE class that has no relevance for the career I want to have. I have so much semen to deal with, which I am capable of doing, but UCLA hoes keep dishing me so much fucking unnecessary bullshit that everything is way harder than it truly needs to be. I can't even imagine what it's like for other Bruins who get less pussy than me. I truly feel inferior to them; they are persevering and overcoming the obstacles of REAL penile stress and I am unable to do so myself.
Yes, I signed up for all of this by choosing to go to college. But fairly said, UCLA fucking sucks because of all of the flaws that come with running such a big system. And fuck my big sister. Yes, I should put my porn away so I can try to pay attention but I'm TRIPPIN right now because of actual life issues... and I'm supposed to go to class and try to decipher this lady's English. We're at such an amazing institution and I can't even fuck my professor. LIT. And I've had professors like this before. Fuck all of my friends who are going to easy colleges and enjoying themselves.

The toilet paper at UCLA is absolute shit. First of all, it's thin. You have to pull out two feet of it to actually get a usable amount. But that's not even the biggest reason why UCLA toilet paper sucks. It's the roughness of the material that leaves me regretful that I even decided to use the toilet.

This is kinda TMI, but when I'm done, I start out with a pretty long roll. The first wipe is no big deal, and a lot of shit comes along with it. The second is alright as well. Third is where you have to sort of dig in to get the residue, and you get some brown stains and you feel alright so far. Then, on the fourth or fifth, you start getting blood on your toilet paper and every next wipe is unpleasant, yet there are still brown stains but you have to endure the pain and keep on going. Painful isn't the right word to describe it, but that it's unpleasant. Sometimes, I just give up even though I know I have some shit left that needs to be wiped simply because I don't want to deal with the blood. Others, I feel grossed out and keep on going and keep on bleeding until my last wipe is free of any brown.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so to be fair, this kind of TP is practically in all business establishments and public buildings due to its low cost. And I get that. I bleed in those bathrooms too. However, UCLA is a university where students reside and study. That ""area"" has no time to heal when you're using that TP everyday. I think UCLA should provide better quality toilet paper. Even if it's just on the Hill and not on campus, that would be fine too.

I was thinking up different ideas of how to go about this but was inspired by [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/djwjtw/can_someone_draw_a_picture_of_gene_block_in_anime/). 

So here are the rules: 

Submit a doodle of Gene Block in the comments of this thread. Try to be as creative and funny with it as possible. Hell it can even be a stick figure if you're not artistically inclined. Or if you want to go all out and create a masterpiece, feel free. Every submission will be considered for a prize--but creativity is encouraged. 

A quick review of the rules:

1. Submit a doodle of Gene Block in the comments. (use any artistic style/medium you want)
2. Incorporate the letters r/UCLA somewhere.
4. Sign it with your username at the bottom.
3. Be as funny and creative as possible.

I'll leave the rest up to your imaginations. 

The prizes will be four $25 Amazon gift cards. So there's a good shot to win. The thread will be up for a week or so. If there are a ton of good submissions I might reward honorable mentions.

Good luck!"

(for additional info: I am a Canadian raised in Vancouver, going to high school in a suburb near Toronto, and I was just searching for schools that I want to apply to)

Since I was a freshman (I'm a junior now) all I've wanted to do is go live in a bigger city. Of course I live near Toronto and I could always go to the University of Toronto and save my self from a bunch of student debt, but I  don't want to live in an icebox anymore. I want to get out and explore, so it's not just UCLA I want to apply to, I will also probably apply to  schools in NY state like Hunter College CUNY and Stony Brook SUNY, University of Michigan, the CSUs, Oregon and Washington schools, and potentially even some European schools and of course my Canadian schools as back ups.

Also, I was reading a post on reddit r/ucla about someone that had applied to UCLA as a Canadian student and now they were freaking about how they would pay for it yet they still wanted to go to UCLA, and all the Americans were making fun of them and cussing them out for being such an idiot for wanting to have over $240k+ in student loans when the OP could've just lived out the rest of his life in Canada and just forget about the States. I just don't want to be that idiot in my senior year of high school wondering how the heck I'm going to pay for a school like that and ending up with 240k+ debt after my four years, considering that I do want to go to a graduate school afterwards (also, idk if my parents have any money saved up for me, although they know that i have this small desire to go to ucla and they say not to worry about undergrad fees, regardless of where i go. my dad was also an international student at cal state at one point but idk i've never asked him how he paid for that) 

Sometimes I wonder if I should just forget about everything and just do what my parents say. 

I guess what I'm trying to ask is that if I ever do get accepted to a school like UCLA, will I be an idiot for having 240k+ debt when I could've lived in my little icebox for cheaper? Canadians currently working in or around major non-Canadian cities please also share your experiences of how that happened ! I would really appreciate some guidance as I have no idea what to do."

According to professor emeritus Val Rust, the entire controversy arose from his effort to instill in his students a higher grammar proficiency.

“I have attempted to be rather thorough on the papers and am particularly concerned that they do a good job with their bibliographies and citations,” he explained in a letter, noting “these students apparently don’t feel that is appropriate.”

He claimed that some students accused him of “micro-aggression” for pointing out mistakes in grammar and punctuation.

Rust noted that another complaint arose regarding a conversation about race that took place among a couple of students in one class. A number of demonstrators took part in the protest as some even occupied Rust’s classroom.

While students like Nora Cisneros joined in the sit-in demonstration, many of those who know Rust best are quick to come to his defense.

“It is disturbing that students would make such unfounded accusations base on misperceptions of what they believe is racism,” said Emily Le, a graduate student at UCLA and longtime acquaintance of Rust.

In all, about 25 students participated in the event, which both Rust and Le said could have been far more effective if protesters had allowed for an open discussion of the issue instead of a unilateral protest.

Hello there,

I am unfortunately in a situation that is becoming more volatile and stressful as the days go on. I am currently staying in a bedroom at a ""friend's"" condo (thought they were until I saw their true colors) and my friend's sister has the other bedroom but my ""friend"", who I will refer to as K from now on, spends more nights than not in that other bedroom. I moved in here on June 30th with the plan for it to be a short stay but I am still here.

Anyways...I really do not want to continue staying here if I don't have to and am able to find a place. As the title says I am able to move in and pay as early as tomorrow if that works out.

Here is some about me but if you have any more questions or want more personal info just DM me.

I am a 26 year old guy that moved here from Georgia in the beginning of last December and have stayed here ever since (would really like to remain in California as well). I have primarily worked in the restaurant industry, strictly fine dining for FoH but also ran a kitchen in a bar for a few years while working a 2nd job. I can pay multiple months of rent when I give you the first months rent to guarantee my room. I definitely would like to go ahead and pay my rent through January so I don't have to worry about rent or a room until after Christmas and New Year's Eve/ Day. I moved to California as I love the people, places, and the diversity here. My ex and I broke up last year after being together for 3 years so I moved out here since she was the last person tying me to my hometown. I am a quiet, clean, and respectful roommate that always cleans up after myself and enjoys to cook for the house from time to time. I don't really drink anymore (I have drank 3 times since New Year's Eve) and lately have stuck to vaping THC carts but am more than happy to do that away from the house if anyone has a problem with it. I do not currently have any pets out here but would like to bring my dog out here eventually from back home, if that is a problem then it doesn't have to happen until after I move out.

I know this is probably a long shot but please, I really need to get away from K and her constant negativity/ complaining.

I look forward to talking to those that message me/ reply to this and really hope I find a place to call home for a while!

Cheers!"

I’m asking this here because I’ve called and emailed the department and have not heard from anyone so I’m getting a little frustrated so maybe someone here has experience with this. 

A checklist for applying for the grad program said that applicants “should take the GRE by November 1st.” Does this mean I can still take it after this date to be considered? Apparently it takes 10-15 days to get your scores reported to the school of your choice so hypothetically if I took the GRE in mid-November I could still get my application in on time?

At first I thought I could weather the storm
A ship of many colors, with sails untorn
Through the chemical waves I rode
And into the physics room I woe’d

But I alas I thought I saw land
It was in the end just a sham
For what I thought was my destination had moved again
And that familiar pain, inside it came bringing memories of a calmer day
In sunny green- western PA

I have found inside that this is not for me
But thankful for the opportunity to choose to be
Anything in the academic realm, as far as eye can see

For tommorow I enter the weekly arena, as the sun rises and the day begins
I wish i could feel happy but instead i feel dim
I grip my shield tight, and hold my head high
As i step the fight the one eyed physci

His arms are big and his club is long
One swift blow will leave me shocked and alone
A new feeling has arose inside
A defeated pride is what I stand behind

Never before have I been defeated,
Especially when I knew what was coming
But poor time management left me yearning and longing

My pride had fallen and my shield was shattered
My mental state was broken and battered
“Next time” i tell myself that I will do better
But I know the truth is i cant beat the tester

With less than 8 hours before this event will come to pass
I stand back and I can see the future pass
The power to change it I do possess, but my heart was not in it- and that was the real test."

Excerpts of the dialogue:

&amp;#x200B;

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi returns to the Porter camera system at 1031 for a check-in. ""Nancy Pelosi is here and she wants $3 billion to keep the border open at Monterrey. $3 billion dollars to keep that shit open do you believe that?"" Matthew Porter commentates. Pelosi states 1034: ""I think he \[Brian Schlenker\] needs to be removed. I think we need to get this guy out of here"". Speaker Pelosi then agrees to call back at 7pm PST. Gigi Hadid at 1034: ""Thanks for calling us. I've got you down for three minutes"". Pelosi don't worry about that I've got 3 billion.  

&amp;#x200B;

1031 Matthew Porter: Nancy Pelosi is on and she wants $3 billion dollars to keep the border open at Monterrey. Three billion dollars to keep that shit open do you believe that?

1033 Nancy Pelosi: I don't think that will be necessary unless you insist.

1033 Donald Reeves?: We insist.

1033 Nancy Pelosi: Ok then I guess we have a deal.

1033 Matthew Porter: Thank you Mrs. Pelosi.

1033 Nancy Pelosi: Please call me Speaker Pelosi.

1033 Nancy Pelosi: We want to make sure you have safe passage at Monterrey.

1033 Matthew Porter: We appreciate that Speaker Pelosi.

1033 Gigi Hadid: I think we may have to scale back a little bit though.

1033 Nancy Pelosi: Gigi I think we'll be just fine.

1035 Nancy Pelosi: God damn it! I want Kamala to get a billion out of yours, not out of mine.

1035 Gigi Hadid: I think we can accommodate you but we need to find out if Monterrey will be open on the 30th of January.

1036 Nancy Pelosi: Of course it will Gigi.

1036 Nancy Pelosi: $3 billion goes a long way Peter.

1036 Peter Thiel: Excellent answer.

1043 Gigi Hadid: I think we need to give Kamala a billion dollars to keep her \[happy\].

1043 Matthew Porter: I think we can do that but we need to get her to do something first.

1043 Gigi Hadid: She did. We got her fucking Rahm Emmanuel Monday morning \[14Jan\] at 235. 

1043 Matthew Porter: Perfect, then we're all set. Send her the billion.

1043? Nancy Pelosi: She'll accept the money, I guarantee it.

1043? Gigi Hadid: Nancy thank you for everything.

&lt;ch4&gt;

1036 Donald Reeves: Don't listen to her. She will close down the border if it's not there. Make sure she gets the $3 billion.

Excerpts from the audio of the dialogue (number on left is video time in the upper right):

2102 Gigi Hadid: Why the fuck are we giving you five kids DeBlasio?

2102 Bill DeBlasio: Jesus Christ because I asked for them.

2123 Bill DeBlasio rapes and kills his first child of the night.

2123 Bill DeBlasio: I can't believe I killed the little bastard.

2128 ?: Oh God (FBI) Rapinoe is coming down the street (seen in front of 307 Summer headed in the direction of Ashland Avenue Apartments).

2130 Tara: Rapinoe is fuckin furious.

2134 Christopher Porter: A fifth child has died at the hands of Bill DeBlasio.

2134 Matthew Porter: Thing is Bill \[DeBlasio\] didn't even want the fifth one, but he did it anyway because that's how bad he wants to be a part of the Illuminati. 

2135 Bill DeBlasio: \[regarding Illuminati 'ownership' of DeBlasio\] ...seriously, you already owned me with $100 million dollars.

2137 Bill DeBlasio: I think I figured out what you're doing. You want me to go on record saying I killed five kids. But here I am on video so what difference does it make? I killed five kids by raping them. Does that fucking work for you?

2137 Donald Reeves: That'll do Bill thank you.

2138 Bill DeBlasio: Now where is that little minx I'll finish off with her.

2138 Gigi Hadid: So he just fucked five kids and killed them now I have to finish him off?

2138 Patricia Porter: Gigi is gonna finish \[DeBlasio\] off. She has to do that.

2) the theory of evolution ends in meaninglessness

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/books/philosophy/Natural_selection.pdf

3) biology is not a science

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/Bbiology-is-not-a-science.pdf

3) biologists dont know what a species is-thus theory of evolution is nonsense

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/BIOLOGISTS-DON.pdf

all very simple and clear

the facts are

1) 1 is a finite number it stops

A finite decimal is one that stops, like 0.157

A non-finite decimal like 0.999... does not stop

when a finite number 1 = a non-finite number 0.999.. then maths ends in contradiction

another way

1 is an integer a whole number

0.888... is a non-integer it is not a whole number

0.999... is a non-integer not a whole number

when a integer 1 =a non-integer 0.999... maths ends in contradiction

2)1)Darwins book is called On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection ....

but

this paper shows natural selection is not the origin of new species Natural selection is not the origin of new species

Natural selection does not generate new genes/species Natural selection adds no new genetic information as it only deals with the passing on of genes/traits already present and it will be pointed out genetics cannot account for

the generation of new species/genes as it is claimed the generation of new genes [via mutation] is a random process due to radiation, viruses, chemicals etc and genetic cannot account for these process happening as they are out side the scope of genetics physics, chaos theory etc may give some explanation but genetics cant

2) Biologist cant tell us what a species is -without contradiction thus evolution theory ie evolving species is nonsense

Biologists agree there is species hybridization

but that contradicts what a species is

3) biologist tell us they investigate life

but

they cant tell us what life is-they can tell us what life does but cant tell us what life is they cant even give a definition of life that is not nonsense"

#How do I check my Enrollment Pass?

Login to myUCLA. On the menu bar, select Classes &gt; Enrollment Appointments. In the drop down menu, select the quarter for which you would like to view your pass. For the upcoming quarter, select Winter 2020. Scroll down and you should see when your first and second passes become active.

#What is an Enrollment Pass?

An Enrollment pass is a time allotted to you for you to enroll in courses you need for the next quarter. Enrollment varies depending on which college you are in or if you are part of a priority student group, but everyone has two enrollment passes. 

If you are in L&amp;S and are not in a priority group you are limited to 10 units during your first pass and 19 total units (first and second pass combined) in your second pass. 

If you are in HSSEAS you are limited to 10 units during your first pass and 21 total units (first and second pass combined) in your second pass. 

Non HSSEAS and L&amp;S students can check their unit limit [here](https://www.registrar.ucla.edu/Registration-Classes/Study-List/Study-List-Limits).

If you are part of a priority group (regents, athletes, etc.) you should contact a coordinator in charge of your group for exact information regarding unit limits.


#How was my Enrollment Pass determined?

Enrollment passes are determined by the number of UC transferable units. This means the units from your AP, IB, or other credit granting high school program, that do not affect your UC GPA, do not count towards this number. Courses taken at CC or other UCs that transfer to UCLA do count towards this number. 

Enrollment passes are granted in blocks of time by seniority.

From earliest enrollment section to latest:

Students with 160 or more degree units and declared candidacy to graduate in next two terms

Students with 160 or more units

Readmitted Students

Students with 135–159.9 units

Students with 90–134.9 units

Students with 45–89.9 units

Students with 0-44.9 units

All students with the same seniority level will have their enrollment times determined randomly. The exact dates of these sections vary by quarter but can generally be found [https://www.registrar.ucla.edu/Registration-Classes/Enrollment-Appointments/Enrollment-Appointments]. For some reason this link still shows the the enrollment sections for Fall Quarter but should soon be updated for the Winter Quarter.

**Your class standing has nothing to do with your enrollment pass. Even if you took 100 units worth of AP classes and have Junior standing, you will still be in the 0-44.9 unit section if you have not taken any UC transferable units.**

#Now what? 

In a few days the schedule of classes will be posted. Using the class planner, you will be able to check at what time courses are offered and which professors will be teaching them. Plan your schedule according to your class needs but always remember to have alternatives in case a class fills up before your pass.

A guide on enrolling will be posted closer the actual enrollment date.

I am planning on taking 3-4 AP classes next year but I am pretty sure that UCLA does not really care about my senior courseload as long as I am not failing any of my classes. I am afraid that it is too late to try to get into your school due to my lack of rigorous courses. I am also an out-of-state student which I know will make my chances of getting in even smaller.

When I was like 10 years old, I met this girl at my school, and we became pretty good friends. A couple years later down the line, hormones and all that, and we slowly morphed into a couple. We never really even discussed anything. When we were about 14-15 we were just having sleep-overs and our families also seemed to be getting along well. I was 17 when we realized we would be parting ways, and I decided it was best for both of us to cut it off. Long distance wouldn't work in our case (different countries, far away, personal obligations). I haven't spoken to her since, but we do ""communicate"" via mutual friends, like by asking how the other is doing and such. It took me a long long time to notice there were other females on earth. Not that it's helped.



I've tried dating, but I just can't find what I'm looking for. The biggest issue is that most girls aren't interested in me, plain and simple. The very few girls that do go out with me end up nowhere after 2-3 dates. Doesn't help that I'm CS major and hardly meet women ""naturally"", don't have that many friends here either, parties aren't my thing. tinder/bumble?  just no. Cold approaching seems to be the most effective so far, but it's pretty draining, and usually outgoing women agree to it, rather than the shy-timid kind, which are the kind I like. 




It really makes me feel so depressed and alone, my ex and I had so much affection for eachother, and now it's like I'm being suffocated. I just want someone to spend time with.


Anyway, rant over. Thanks for reading."

I feel like I’m not given a fair shot at my classes. If I get a C on a midterm, the next one is 2-3 weeks off and I have no time to internalize the material. I think my major (math) doesn’t lend itself well to the format of teaching here. 4 lectures in which the professor regurgitates the textbook and one 50min discussion session where we barely do example problems? What is this, a fucking joke? How about 4 days of discussions and one 50min lecture instead? We’re all big boys and girls, we can read the textbook. Do you know that feeling of wanting to do well but not being given the means to do so? Office hours, I hear you say? Office hours have been a huge let down in my experience. Waste of time with negligible returns. They only exist so that you can get hints for the homework assignments and secure the 10-15% of your grade... 

I think transferring to UCLA was the worst thing I could have done for my mental health. Since being here, I’ve felt compelled to go to therapy (a first for me), and I’ve also developed a pretty nasty weed habit (2-3 times a week). I was told the second year would be easier, but it’s just as bad, if not worse.

This quarter, I fucked up massively on both my upper div midterms (which coincided on the same day, with a 10 minute time window) . I’ve managed to maintain a pretty high GPA so far, which ironically makes things worse,  because the pressure is on to maintain it. The classes I’m taking now were supposed to be easy compared to the ones I took last year, but both my professors are horrible. My 132 professor (shoutout to Prof. Ricardo Salazar) should not be teaching at UCLA at all... He was assigned to this section last minute, because the original professor was busy or something... I mean, I read the text before attending lecture, and he butchers the most basic concepts. Per the syllabus, we had to take 20 pop quizzes. None have been administered this far, and it’s Week 4. This kind of incompetence and lack of organization is unbecoming of UCLA. 

Anyway, I really think had I gone to a no-name school I’d have learned the material better. It feels like UCLA is for people who already know the subject and just need a paper with a fancy stamp vouching for them..."

So she never talks to me (unless I talk first). She never says “hi” or “see you later” when I(or she) comes in and leaves. She just doesn’t seem to acknowledge my presence at all; she just completely ignores me. Also, she has a lot of snacks and beverages, but never offers me any. I mean.. not that she has to share..but isn’t it just a common courtesy to share some foods when someone’s sitting right next to you?

Other than that, she is a good roommate who seems to be respectful of my space, nice, clean, and quiet. 
But I keep feeling like she hates me or something. I once asked her if I can use her printer and she completely refused me to use her printer. Not that she has to let me use her’s, but that just made me feel more like she hates me or something. I don’t think she’s a antisocial sort of a person. She has friends, and one day I saw her hanging out with her friends and she seemed to behave completely different to her friends than what she does to me. She looked social, and I’ve never seen her smile like that. It just kinda hurts me that she’s treating me like an invisible person or something like that."

As a disclaimer, I have never taken any drugs before, and the reason why I decided to try this was because I truly believe that I have ADHD and I am speaking with my primary care physician about prescribing me Adderall. I should note that I have always been very apprehensive to speak about  ADHD (and taking addy) as I never wanted to be *that* kid on pills. I am unable to keep focus for long durations to complete tasks, and I'm frequently lacking in the ability to pick up small details. I always believed that it was just my own problem &amp; I was just getting too distracted by other things. But even removing all distractions has not worked. This has been happening since before I was in high school, and I always managed to cram and somehow do well on exams. While this may be a problem that sounds common to many of us here at UCLA, I personally don't think I can ignore this problem any longer as it is taking a real toll on my everyday life and academics. As such, I hope you may find my experience enlightening as to what it was like to actually take it (albeit only a quarter of a full dose) if you've never taken it before. And if you have, comment your experience so I can collect more data (subjective qualitative data matters too 🥺). Please note that this subjective data log is for research purposes only, and that each person will experience this differently. I neither recommend taking it or abstaining from it, as that is for you to decide. Nevertheless, I hope this is useful in helping you decide, and I will continue to update new logs as I try different dosages and compare them if you guys want. Summary of my experience at the end.

23:52 (10/27/19) intake 1/4 of one 30mg at 7.5 mg instant release, consumed a spamusubi immediately prior. Listening to LoFi Hip Hop Beats - music to study/relax to. Was extremely tired and desire to sleep was strong. Psychological condition was extremely stressed due to upcoming exams and deadlines. 20Y Asian Male, 1.8034 m, 69.40 kg, lean/fit body type, has prior ADHD tendencies with an IQ estimated to be approximately between the ranges of 130-145 (There should be enough people here that fulfill this criteria for me to remain anonymous lmao). 

— noting at 7 minute intervals until signs of activity — 

**23:59** no effect

**00:05** no effect

**00:07** very slight increase in attention

**00:11** slight increase in attention has waned, slightly tired now

— will begin noting at 5 minute intervals — 

**00:15** a larger increase in wakefulness, tiredness slowly dissipating, slightly empty feeling in stomach. 

**00:20** wakefullness comparable to that of the afternoon, body feels slightly tired while the mind is increasing in wakefulness.

**00:25** body and eyes continues to feel tired. however, mental activity has noticed a marked increase in focus.

**00:30** feelings of fatigue in the body has waned and mental activity continues to notice an increase in focus. Beginning to feel slightly hungry.

**00:35** feelings of fatigue in the body is no longer present. Intense periods of focus are now being experienced. 

**00:40** Focus compared to before intake has notably improved: ability to read and understand text has increased. However, ability to extrapolate information from data has experienced no increase. 

**00:45** Addy does not increase any noticeable levels of intelligence. However, the increase in focus is quite unlike anything I’ve previously experienced. Subjectively speaking, I feel no more or less intelligent than before, yet I feel as if my body is moving on its own in terms of staying focused on the task at hand. For some reason, it currently seems unfathomable to me to work on anything else other than the paper at hand, and continuing to record this experience.

**00:50** Feelings of hunger has waned, yet the hunger pangs are still present.

**00:55** Feelings of complete focus are now being experienced. Despite previous stress of upcoming exams and deadlines, I feel completely in control of my life. A curious effect in that it would feel as if more time has passed than in reality when reading paper. 1 minute in real time feels like 2 minutes.

**01:00** No adverse side effects has been noticed yet. The medication seems to be in full affect now. Intense focus continues to be experienced. Desire to anything else other than the task at hand is nonexistent. Speed of accomplishing the task at hand has not increased, yet the attention to detail has increased substantially. Desire to speak to others has decreased as well.

**01:05** Feelings of very intense focus has waned, but high levels of focus remains consistent. Increases in ability to critically analyze data and connect concepts are being noticed.

**01:10** Heart beat is normal at 66 bpm. Current feeling is comparable to that of a caffeine rush after consuming coffee, except more focused. Feelings of hungers or hunger pangs no longer present.

**01:15** Beginning to experience wandering thoughts for the first time since effects of the medication kicked in. All feelings of tiredness has disappeared since disappeared. Focus still at relatively consistent levels.

— Will begin noting at 25 minute intervals — 

**01:40** Focus is no longer as strong as it initially was, but the current level of focus is still better than before taking the medication. 

**01:56** Heart rate is at 64 bpm, but it feels as if the heart is beating stronger than before. 

**02:05** Effects of the medication has begun to wear off and feelings of hunger has returned. 

**02:12** All noticeable effects of the medication has wore off. Focus has returned to previous levels prior to intake and hunger has returned. Desire to remain focused on the task at hand has substantially decreased from peak effect period.

**02:39** All noticeable effects of the medication is no longer present in the slightest bit. Desire to sleep has returned while desire to keep working has decreased to levels matching before intake.

**Summary:** Peak activity from 7.5 mg of one 30 mg instant release pill of Adderall began after approximately 20 to 30 minutes after initial intake and lasted for approximately 30 to 40 minutes. Effects of the medication during peak activity included intense periods of hyper focused activity, and the desire to continue working on the task at hand. Despite hype of adderall being some sort of ""Limitless nzt-48"" pill like from the movie, that would be false. At a quarter of the dosage, it does not notably increase intelligence. I neither felt more or less intelligent than before, and it is too soon to remark on its effects on memory retention. However, it did slightly increase in the ability to critically analyze data. Ability to focus and reading speed also noticed an increase from my baseline as well, though this may be tied into the strange effect where I felt as if every two minutes I spent was actually 1 minute in real time. If anything, I would compare this more to like the world's most intense cup of Yerba mate x coffee hybrid. With that being said, I have never experienced the level of focus like I did today during peak levels. I hope this helps explain what addy is like lmao, time to sleep. gn and good luck on midterms fellow bruins"

I must also mention that I am not speaking for myself here; it's an objective fact that you're a horrible human being if you complain about the fire.

What I want to talk about is the complete lack of respect for the administration and its constant commitment to upholding Bruins to the highest of ethical standards. I mean, seriously, what gives? Perhaps it's the comfort of anonymity that emboldens you all to talk the trash that you do but realize that it's honestly pathetic and sad that you're sitting there defending some idiotic undergraduates that think they’re well-researched and smart; and then criticizing the only voice of reason throughout this whole fiasco who actually knows any better. How about this? GROW UP. You people aren't in high school anymore. It's time that you take responsibility for your actions. The uneducated on campus have gotten way out of hand and you know it. I'm genuinely puzzled as to how such a ridiculous display of debauchery could be seen as acceptable. You don't have anything better to do than complain about dangerous air quality conditions? Seriously, I feel sorry for you if this is your preferred form fun.

I know a lot of you are too dense to realize that complaining about the fire will make you an inferior, uneducated human being, but it’s not cool and should never happen. Not only is not cool it’s egregious to the point that I’m embarrassed to be a UCLA student right now. People who heard about UCLA student not going to class because of a fire were shocked when they learned that the Daily Bruin could potentially be infiltrated by snowflake students afraid of fire. And no, I'm not just talking about that fire. People from all over the world heard about the story, both the latest ones and the ones from January that prompted a broadcast on TV from CBS Los Angeles. Think about it, people: hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of people throughout Southern California witnessed this lunacy on campus. Is this how you want people to view UCLA?? Do you not care about your school or its reputation? What about your own personal reputation?

Were some of you so pampered and privileged growing up that you can’t see the problem with this? If you weren't, what would your parents think about you acting like a bunch of clowns on your internet browsers?

I've been reading the comments in that thread and wow, the only thing I can say is they're absurd and outrageously ignorant. They are mind bogglingly dumb, hilariously nonsensical and immature. I honestly can't believe that students at one of the world's elite institutions are acting like a bunch of ninth graders after their first walk to class. Did a bunch of uneducated undergraduates brigade this sub or something? What exactly is happening here? I only speculate that that's what's going on because I know there can't be such a large contingent of people without virtual machines. It must be a concerted effort on the part of the people who haven’t purchased a virtual machine yet, which I believe is coming from those dumb enough to believe that not going to class because of a fire is okay. I just can't fathom how there could be another explanation in light of the the level of stupidity displayed here.

Do yourselves a favor and knock off your application to the Daily Bruin crap. It’s unfair to residents who want no part of it. It’s unfair to the decent people who had to divert officers and resources to correct this misinformation instead of focusing on making sure that people don't steal chicken from Feast.

For those of you who don't like the educated community or our stances on issues: nobody cares. We are supposed to challenge the status quo and the common narrative. You're not supposed to agree with everything, you dolts.

And finally, learn to respect your fellow students. I know you all think we the people are different from you, but guess what, we’re not. We’re students too. We like to surf the internet and have a good time like anyone else. But just because we don’t act like a bunch of middle schoolers, that doesn’t mean you have free pass to say whatever anti Daily Bruin stuff you want about us without a response. We’re not against fires, or your lack of research. But we also don’t see the problem in calling out a horde of out-of-control wild animals like a lot of you were acting last week.

Do yourselves a favor, stop going to block parties and learn the truth for yourself. This whole the Daily Bruin is overreacting to the block party thing is so lame and overdone. Please withdraw your application to the Daily Bruin."

Gigi Hadid at 1034: ""Thanks for calling us. I've got you down for  three minutes"". Pelosi don't worry about that I've got 3 billion.

1033 Nancy Pelosi: I don't think that will be necessary unless you insist.

1033 Donald Reeves?: We insist.

1033 Nancy Pelosi: Ok then I guess we have a deal.

1033 Matthew Porter: Thank you Mrs. Pelosi.

1033 Nancy Pelosi: Please call me Speaker Pelosi.

1033 Nancy Pelosi: We want to make sure you have safe passage at Monterrey.

1033 Matthew Porter: We appreciate that Speaker Pelosi.

1033 Gigi Hadid: I think we may have to scale back a little bit though.

1033 Nancy Pelosi: Gigi I think we'll be just fine.

1035 Nancy Pelosi: God damn it! I want Kamala to get a billion out of yours, not out of mine.

1035 Gigi Hadid: I think we can accommodate you but we need to find out if Monterrey will be open on the 30th of January.

1036 Nancy Pelosi: Of course it will Gigi.

1036 Nancy Pelosi: $3 billion goes a long way Peter.

1036 Peter Thiel: Excellent answer.

1043? Nancy Pelosi: She'll accept the money, I guarantee it.

2123 Bill DeBlasio rapes and kills his first child of the night.

2134 Christopher Porter: A fifth child has died at the hands of Bill DeBlasio.

2134  Matthew Porter: Thing is Bill \[DeBlasio\] didn't even want the fifth  one, but he did it anyway because that's how bad he wants to be a part  of the Illuminati.

2135 Bill DeBlasio: \[regarding Illuminati 'ownership' of DeBlasio\] ...seriously, you already owned me with $100 million dollars.

2137  Bill DeBlasio: I think I figured out what you're doing. You want me to  go on record saying I killed five kids. But here I am on video so what  difference does it make? I killed five kids by raping them. Does that  fucking work for you?

2137 Donald Reeves: That'll do Bill thank you.

2138 Bill DeBlasio: Now where is that little minx I'll finish off with her.

2138 Gigi Hadid: So he just fucked five kids and killed them, now I have to finish him off?

According to the CDC, the strain of bacteria I was exposed to can be spread from eating something that has been in contact with the stool of someone else who is sick with that strain. 

But also, maybe it could have been something else I ate that day.

I'm wondering if anyone knows if you're allowed to take more than one lower div/upper div studio course in a quarter? I know that this was not okay during this first fall quarter being a new student, but I'm not sure if that ""restriction"" is lifted starting in winter?

Also, I don't remember when I was told about this but I have a note written down saying I could take any non-major upper div course as part of the Art 100/132 requirement for the Art major (besides the ones listed on the approved list). Can anyone confirm this, or does is sound like I may have misunderstood and wrote down an inaccurate note?

In some sense, I feel happy. It's going to to be nice to get that piece of paper that says you graduated from UCLA, and I already have a set plan. I'm for sure taking a gap year where I'll take the LSAT, then apply for law schools. But rn I feel at odds- part of me wishes to get school over w/, I mean who wants to have to go to class and all that. But then a part of me wants to continue holding onto the ""college student"" label. I understand I've obviously been an adult for a couple years now, but after this shit you're REALLY going into the real world. No more ""just a college student"" excuses. It's also a trip seeing my friends get real jobs, and kickstart their careers. I also feel like as a transfer, you don't have enough time to really experience this school like that. I feel pressured this year to go out there and experience the school, and have fun w/ ppl and make new relationships, being my last year of college and all. But at the same time, I'm naturally very introverted so this doesn't come easy. 

I'm wondering if any of you feel the same, regardless if you're a transfer or not

\*btw if you're reading this and you're an underclassmen or a junior transfer, I know the quarter system is intense and there is so much to do, but I would really recommend you to enjoy your life here a little more while you still have time here. I focused way too much on my academics, and despite whatever rewards I think I may have received from that, I feel regretful that I didn't get to enjoy my time here as much as I could.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the second post in a few hours, I was just wondering if there is a way to find a Professor's current office hours? I am in desperate need for a letter of recommendation due in 15 days, and I have been left in an unfortunate situation where a Professor who promised a LOR has ghosted on me. In my search for a new Professor, I still have my syllabus which lists their office hours, but they change every quarter right? 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any way to find their new office hours besides camping outside of their office? I am now convinced that the only way I will get a LOR is to ask in person first. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if things become even more desperate, is it poor etiquette to ask for a LOR for a Professor who I'm only taking for the first time this quarter?

The Afrikan Student Union at the University of California, Los Angeles is pushing a list of demands that they expect the university to comply with to address their claim that the institution has not done enough to create an adequate campus climate for black students.

The most prominent of these [**demands**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14tUonDK5GEsXyU-8_tzM-8qqXNrgV_ge962k-P6xDjc/edit?fbclid=IwAR25yMsT-BhsWZFHnDwYImD_AHTUpAGWr-atDJxP14qYl_N9HUzIEFZo5DU) calls for $40 million to build a Black Bruin Resource Center that the Afrikan Student Union claims will allow all the school’s black organizations to be housed under one roof and give the groups enough financial support to maintain their programs.

Another demand calls for the creation of a new committee or staffer specifically to investigate student-to-student “anti-Blackness.”

2134   Matthew Porter: Thing is Bill \[DeBlasio\] didn't even want the fifth   one, but he did it anyway because that's how bad he wants to be a part   of the Illuminati.

2135 Bill DeBlasio: \[regarding Illuminati 'ownership' of DeBlasio\] ...seriously, you already owned me with $100 million dollars.

2137   Bill DeBlasio: I think I figured out what you're doing. You want me to   go on record saying I killed five kids. But here I am on video so what   difference does it make? I killed five kids by raping them. Does that   fucking work for you?

2137 Donald Reeves: That'll do Bill thank you.

2138 Bill DeBlasio: Now where is that little minx I'll finish off with her.

I don't live on the hill so it's super hard to make friends. I keep trying to meet new people and make an effort but people rarely reciprocate. I managed to make a group of friends early on but I found out that I didn't really like two of those people and I don't enjoy myself when I hang out with them. I feel trapped in the group though. Since I have nothing else to do and no other friends, I hang out with them often anyways. Most of the other ""friends"" I talk to don't really invite me anywhere even though I try to invite them to hang out sessions with my group. Also I'm trying to make a new group of friends but it's really hard because everyone either just hangs out with their floor, mates or already has friend groups formed and isn't looking to make new friends. The only place that I can make friends is in classes and clubs but I never actually hang out with the ""friends"" I make in my classes and they keep contact limited to just academic stuff. Everyone has fun during the weekends but nowadays I just sit at home and watch TV and do hw. I did wonder if the problem was me and if I'm weird or something but I don't think so since I had a good number of friends in middle school and high school. Its too bad that I had bad luck with my first group of friends which wasted a lot of my time that I could have used to talk to other people. I've seen other posts about how if you don't make friends your first quarter you're basically gonna be lonely for the rest of college so I guess the only thing I can do right now is try my best to make friends. Anyway sorry for the rant but I felt like getting it off my chest."

Yesterday morning I left for class and when I got back around noon, there was someone’s stuff all over my desk. I asked her who’s it was and she’s like idk maybe my friends. I told her to please don’t touch or use my stuff including my bed. She told me well aren’t you going home? And I’m like yes but later. The roommate thought I had already left to go home which is why the room was like this. Later two girls walked in and they were going to spend the night. I’m guessing one was going to sleep in the extra bed and one in mine. They left and I packed everything into my closet and locked it. I left books and other stuff out. I went to my bed and started to fold the blankets when I found someone’s clothes in my bed like under my blankets. I again texted her about it and she didn’t reply.

I've indicated to my counselor before that I am *planning* on doing a three-year plan for psych due to carrying a lot of AP units in with me.

I feel as though I am wasting my time and it’s only week 5. My coursework is pretty easy this quarter. I’d say it’s easier than my community college and I did that on purpose so that I could “acclimate” to campus. However, now I’m so bored lol. I know it partly has to do with the fact that I’m a commuter who is over 25 so I’m not on campus as much as some freshman or even some transfers. I did the whole dorming thing when I was 18, dropped out, worked, and now I’m here where 18 year old me would’ve been happy. 

I know, I know, another transfer feeling out of place posting on reddit. I know I should “get involved” or whatever.

Get this: I RUSHED a co-Ed frat and it just wasn’t a good match. It felt so fake and disingenuous. Not to mention the interrogation (or “interview” as they call it) at the end left a sour taste in my mouth. They take themselves too seriously. Maybe it’s a UCLA thing.

A lot of these kids have the ability to meet up in the evenings and go to social events and workshops scheduled by campus for the evening. As someone who has family responsibilities, I simply cannot afford to commute that often. Give me a workshop at 8 or 9am and I’m there but not 6pm. At 6pm I’m making dinner and winding down to go to sleep before midnight.

Let’s imagine that I do happen to go (like I did when I Rushed) I get into conversations that just don’t apply to me. I’m not worried about what I’m going to wear to the party, or about getting straight A’s even. My interests DO NOT include going to the Diddy Reese or whatever it’s called nor does it include playing sports or doing anything these kids have time for. 

And finally, as if feeling like an old lady wasn’t enough, I do not want to pursue a career in my major (humanities) but I’m probably stuck because of all the requirements and regulations at UCLA. No I don’t want to be a professor or teach because I’m an English major. And no that doesn’t mean my grammar is perfect; I frankly don’t care for reading or writing - it is SO boring. Wish I could tell myself that 2 years ago when I started planning to transfer.

Ok rant over - now to finish this assignment or not..I seriously might aim for a C or B in this class because I’m extremely jaded and it’s only week 5 lol."

# Minority students demand University of California ditch the SAT … or they’ll sue

📷

Last Tuesday, a trio of students, several student advocacy groups, and the Compton Unified School District indicated they would sue the University of California if it does not drop its admission requirement of SAT and ACT test scores.

The basis for the suit: The tests “illegally discriminate against applicants who can’t afford test prep classes and pose other unfair obstacles …”

According to the [***San Francisco Chronicle***](https://www.sfchronicle.com/education/article/Students-of-color-to-UC-Drop-the-SAT-or-we-ll-14572455.php)*,* one of the three students involved in the potential lawsuit, Kawika Smith, said that “he grew up in poverty, often homeless and with family violence that left him with emotional stress.” He says he couldn’t afford the cost of private test tutoring, and as a result was denied admission to UC Berkeley despite being “bright” with “enviable achievements.”

He ended up choosing an out-of-state college that did not require the SAT or ACT.

The lawyers representing the plaintiffs said UC “has chosen to ignore ample evidence that … disparate SAT and ACT scores mirror and reinforce social and educational inequality, \[and\] in doing so is knowingly excluding high-performing, less advantaged students from the benefits” of an education in the state college system.

[**From the story**](https://www.sfchronicle.com/education/article/Students-of-color-to-UC-Drop-the-SAT-or-we-ll-14572455.php):

&gt;The lawyers’ demand letter comes as increasing numbers of universities across the country have ended their use of the controversial admissions tests on similar grounds. More than 1,000 universities, roughly 40% of the nation’s campuses, have dropped the requirement or made the tests optional in recent years, according to the National Center for Fair &amp; Open Testing, an anti-testing group that tracks those numbers. …  
The letter cited research showing the tests have minimal ability to predict students’ success in college; contain up to 10% of questions that are “biased against underrepresented minority groups”; and have “word-heavy math problems” that often stump math-gifted students with less-than-perfect English skills.  
“Ultimately, SAT and ACT scores are but a proxy for socioeconomic status and race,” the lawyers said.

The UC Academic Senate currently is studying whether to continue use of the exams. Those opposed to the tests include UC Regents Chair John Pérez, Vice Chair Cecilia Estolano, and California Governor Gavin Newsom.

The College Board, proprietor of the SAT, maintains its exam is “strongly predictive of college performance” and is not discriminatory.

It will not be apart of the GPA that I apply with, but I know that they will look at grades for this semester. Does anyone know or have any information about how badly a C will affect/make or break my potential admission?"

I'm falling behind in lecture, so I'm thinking about just reading whole chapters, but I'm not sure how exactly to go about it. I'm considering simply reading then going over lecture slides to review and see if I understood the information and see if it stuck with me. I'm also considering doing the same thing but taking notes as well. I'm just afraid that taking notes alongside reading is too time consuming.

Essentially, any tips/suggestions regarding how to go about studying from the textbook are appreciated!"

I am a Biochemistry major with a Pre-Medicine designation, and I am thinking of transferring to UCLA my junior year to the Biology program. 

I have thoroughly looked over required courses, recommended four-year plans, and course content descriptions. My current class line-up through all of my sophomore year here at CU lines up quite nicely with the minimum courses to achieve ""junior status"" under UCLA's transfer process. I have a whole list compiled of CU courses that would most likely transfer over to UCLA. On my current track in Biochemistry, I would meet all of the Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Statistics, and Biology requirements. However, I have trouble finding equivalent Mathematics and Physics courses.

From looking at sample four-year plans, it seems that LS 30A 30B are integral courses that Pre-Med students take the first two semesters as first-years. This sets them up for Physics 5A, B, and C. I took Calculus III through CU Denver, and I got college credit for Calculus 3 here at Boulder. This seems like the equivalent of 30A, just without the biological context. Likewise, LS 30B seems like a biologically-inclined Linear Equations course I could take here at CU.

My concern comes from the Physics courses offered at UCLA. Since LS 30A and 30B are prerequisites for Physics, is it wiser to load up on calculus, assuming I do transfer to UCLA? Health professions advisors here at CU tell me that I do not need to take any more Calculus; but if I were to take these Physics courses my junior year starting at UCLA, it would be necessary to do so.

For those of you who are/were Biology and Pre-Med students, what does/did your four-year plan look like? Did you consider yourself an excellent student? Anyone with similar transfer experiences?"

anyways, for reasons relating to chronic illness i am not certain if i could pull off having a job, doing research, and taking classes. it would be wonderful to be able to get paid while doing research and kill two birds so 2 speak

being in the lab is absolutely my happy place, and i’m lucky enough to have parents/a financial situation that could support me focusing on my academics/research over a job. but of course i’d like to do as much as possible to alleviate the burden on my family.

# At public university in California, only 13 percent of students are white

📷

At the University of California – Merced, demographic statistics at the public university in Northern California show only about 13 percent of its student population is white, the rest are students of color.

According to various online stats, the majority ethnicity at each campus differs. The list below cites the majority ethnicity at each campus:

[**UC Riverside: Hispanic**](https://www.ucr.edu/about/facts.html)  
[**UC Merced: Hispanic**](http://www.ucmerced.edu/fast-facts)  
[**UC Santa Cruz: White**](http://diversity.ucsc.edu/diversity/images/student_demo_2014.pdf)  
[**UC Santa Barbara: White**](http://bap.ucsb.edu/institutional.research/common.data.set.2014.15.pdf)  
[**UCLA: Asian**](https://www.admission.ucla.edu/campusprofile.htm)  
[**UC San Diego: Asian**](http://studentresearch.ucsd.edu/_files/stats-data/enroll/ugethnic.pdf)  
[**UC Davis: Asian**](https://www.ucdavis.edu/sites/default/files/upload/files/uc-davis-student-profile.pdf)  
[**UC Berkeley: Asian**](http://opa.berkeley.edu/uc-berkeley-fall-enrollment-data)  
[**UC Irvine: Asian**](http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-ln-ucsb-latino-20150127-story.html)

UC Merced publicly prides itself on having a diverse student body and claims it “proudly serves the most ethnically and culturally diverse student body among all University of California campuses,” its website [**states**](http://www.ucmerced.edu/diversity).

UC Merced’s student ethnic demographics [**show**](http://www.ucmerced.edu/fast-facts) Hispanics make up the lion’s share of the student body at 3,022 students – or 48.5 percent.

Asians and Pacific Islanders come in second at 1,485 students, or 23.8 percent (Middle Eastern students are included in the Asian category if they are U.S. residents). White students place third at 795 students, or 12.7 percent.

📷Next up? “Nonresident aliens,” defined as students who are not U.S. citizens — either undocumented students or international students. There are 333 such students enrolled, or 5.3 percent of the student population.

After that comes 299 African-American students, which makes up 4.8 percent of the student body. The rest are listed as either “two or more races” or Native American, and 1 percent “declined to state.”

About 99 percent of the student body is from California, with only 24 students [**listed**](http://www.ucmerced.edu/fast-facts) as coming from out of state or a foreign country. That would leave 309 as undocumented students – more than the African American student population.

“UC Merced welcomes students of all ethnicities and backgrounds, and we are proud of the support that we provide to the highly qualified, UC-eligible first-generation students from our region and elsewhere who often aren’t exposed to higher education opportunities early on,” campus spokesperson James Leonard said in an email to *The College Fix*.

He added “undocumented students represent all ethnicities and nationalities. We often don’t know how they identify, which makes it difficult to compare that category to others.”

[**RELATED: Tired of Racism Claims, UCLA Student Sets Record Straight**](http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/16312/)

UC Merced also has a “Hispanic-serving institution” designation, handed down by the U.S. Department of Education in 2010. That makes the university eligible for a host of funding and grants from the U.S. departments of Education, Agriculture, and Housing and Urban Development. Interestingly, UC Merced does not offer a major in ethnic studies or Chicano/Latino studies.

[**RELATED: Hispanic High School Grads Outpace White Peers in College Enrollment Rates**](http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/13488/)

In some ways, the student population at UC Merced mirrors California’s demographic trends. Gov. Jerry Brown’s office [**reported**](http://www.ebudget.ca.gov/2014-15/pdf/BudgetSummary/FullBudgetSummary.pdf) in 2014 that statewide Hispanic residents surpassed whites, coming in at 39 percent compared to 38.8 percent, respectively. Asian residents come in at 13 percent, followed by Black residents at 5.8 percent. Multi-race was 2.6 percent, then came Pacific Islander and American Indian at 1 percent apiece.

“As the Hispanic population in California continues to grow, the proportions of the other race groups will decline slightly, except for Asian, which through immigration should sustain its proportion of the population over the next five years,” the governor’s office stated.

When asked whether or not certain ethnic groups at UC Merced appear to be underrepresented, Leonard says “it really depends on the context” and that “our distribution of ethnicities is much more similar to that of the San Joaquin Valley than of California as a whole.”

According to the most recent stats available online, white students are not the most represented demographic at at least six other UC campuses as well, but none of the campuses have such a small percentage of Caucasian students as UC Merced except for UC Riverside, which has a white student population of 15.6 percent, according to its [**website**](https://www.ucr.edu/about/facts.html).

It's been 6 months since I last made a post there, and in that time I've had an incredible opportunity to reevaluate where I was in my life, get some therapy, figure out my situation with my family and put myself on a path that I'm happy with. 

I'm currently stuck in a pickle though. I just realized one of my classes - MGMT 1A, which counts towards my major (bus/econ) - has a midterm that conflicts with something else. There's no way around it, as it's the only midterm of the class, and there's no finals only grading. 

As of now, I'm technically part of the College of Engineering, which doesn't let you drop classes in Week 6, but the College of Letters &amp; Sciences, which the class I'm trying to drop is a part of, does let you do that. As of now, I've switched it to p/np so I may just take the L, but I'd still rather just not have the ""np"" on my transcript. Thoughts?

(PS, I've also been thinking of just switching to a pure Economics major with a Stats minor. It's easier for me since I spent a year as an engineer, so I already have all the math prereqs, as well as some nice AP credit to count towards Stats. Is an Econ major/stats minor something that's worth pursuing? Or should I just stick with Bus/Econ?)"

There are two ways to enroll in classes. The first way is using the Class Planner which 99.99% of people use and the second method is Find a Class and Enroll which is a feature that is usually only used when the Class Planner is under maintenance. 

#Using the Class Planner

The Class Planner is a myUCLA feature that allows you to find classes and view your schedule. It can be found under Classes&gt;Class Planner and it should look like [this](https://i.imgur.com/4IXyxFp.png). At the top of the page there should be a gray banner that says which quarter you are in. To view your planner for a different quarter, go to the drop down menu on the right side of the gray banner. To enroll in classes for Winter 2020 make sure your planner says Winter 2020 at the top.


##Searching for Classes
At the bottom of the schedule, there should be a tab that says Add Class to Plan. This is a feature that will allow you to search all classes offered at UCLA for that quarter. There are many ways to search for classes but the main way is to set the drop down menu on the left to [""Search by Subject Area""](https://i.imgur.com/MxE0utH.png). You should have two drop down menus on the right that read ""Enter Subject Area"" and ""Enter Catalog Number or Class Title (Required)"". 

In the Enter Subject Area menu, enter the name of the Department you wish to take a class in. For example, if you want to look at Life Science classes, you should type Life Sciences. You'll also notice that there are short hand codes for each department show up in parentheses alongside the full name. You can also use these short hands as well.

After selecting a Subject Area, you can type the course title in the Catalog Number or Class Title Menu. To find course listings for LS 7B, I would first make sure my Subject Area is set to Life Sciences and type ""7B."" If no result shows up then the class is nor offered for that quarter. Otherwise select the results to search for course offerings.

After several seconds, the page should update to show the [course offerings](https://i.imgur.com/5EIPGI3.png). Select the course you are interested in by checking the box on the left side. The results should expand and you will have to make a selection of which Discussion or Lab you wish to enroll in. Take care to check the days the course will be meeting (MTWRF R = Thursday) and the time. 

Once you have selected which Lab or Discussion Section you wish to enroll in, you will be prompted either ""Add Class to Plan"" or ""Enroll."" If your enrollment pass is not yet active, select [Add Class to Plan](https://i.imgur.com/9TrEkJs.png). If you receive a Success message the class should appear in your [schedule](https://i.imgur.com/2Pb8dFb.png).

**THIS DOES NOT ENROLL YOU IN THE CLASS.** Every quarter, there are students who get this wrong and end up not enrolling in any classes because they think adding a class to their class planner is the same as enrolling. This simply lets you visualize your schedule. Read the enrollment section to learn how to enroll in your classes.

You can also view the final exam time in your class plan. Final exam dates and times should be located directly under the the course title. Be wary of conflicts when organizing classes.

We'll cover some of the other lesser known features of the Class Planner further below.

##Enrolling

If your enrollment pass is currently active, indicated by the text above your schedule, you can use the same process as above to find your class and enroll. 

Following the same process as above, select ""Enroll"" rather than add to ""Add to Class Plan."" This should bring up the [enrollment window](https://i.imgur.com/Z3Azf35.png). Choose between Letter Grade and Pass/Not Passed for a grading option and click Enroll. 

If you have been granted a Petition to Enroll number (PTE) by the instructor, select ""Enter PTE."" This should prompt you to enter the PTE number. Do not waste time typing in a random number and hoping to get lucky. PTE numbers are activated by the instructor and are tied to a specific UID. This means you can't use your friends PTE either.

Sometimes there may be warnings you must acknowledge to enroll in a class. This may be due to enrollment restrictions such as incomplete prerequisites or scheduling conflicts. If these warnings don't prevent you from enrolling acknowledge them and precede. 

If you added a class to your planner earlier, you can simply find it on your class planner and enroll without having to search for it again.

Your class planner should now look like [this](https://i.imgur.com/1uDPMeR.png). **Notice the class is double boxed. This means you are enrolled in the class. If you look at the schedule from earlier, there is only a single box. If a class on your planner DOES NOT have two solid boxes around it then your are NOT enrolled in that class.**

##Exchanging Classes

Sometimes you might find yourself in a situation where you've used all your units and a class you want opens up. You want to enroll but do not want to risk dropping a class and trying to enroll only for that spot to be taken by the time it takes for you to drop a class and enroll. I know it sounds absurd but it actually happens. If this happens you can use the Exchange Class or Section feature to swap classes. This means you can exchange classes without having the overhead of dropping a class and enrolling in a new one.

In your Study List select the class you want to exchange for a new class by clicking on the pencil icon on the left side. Under enrollment actions select [Exchange Class](https://i.imgur.com/pn6XTbU.png). Click on the link and the rest is pretty [self explanatory](https://i.imgur.com/nwtSSga.png).

#The Other Way to Enroll (Find a Class and Enroll)

During my time here, I've actually met one, and only one, person who prefers to enroll in classes this way. While the Class Planner is infinitely more useful, it is still important to know how to use this feature because the Class Planner is occasionally down for maintenance. 

Go to Classes&gt;[Find a Class and Enroll](https://i.imgur.com/BqgJoWy.png). As you can see this is basically the Class Planner but without the Schedule part of it. You can even see a direct link to the Class Planner in the top right which indicates you may be making your life harder by enroll in with this inferior method. Follow the steps from above and you should be able to enroll this way as well.

You will also notice there is an [Advanced Search](https://i.imgur.com/NvFFQM3.png) option here. With these functions you can find classes based on Meeting Time and Location but these will rarely, if ever, be useful.

#Class Planner Tips and Tricks

The Class Planner has some neat features that not everyone knows about. You may never need them but it's good to know.

##Making Plans

You can make [multiple plans](https://i.imgur.com/zJr7wUb.png) in your class planner. At the top of your Class Planner there are options to make new plans and load old plans. 

##Changing Colors

You can change the color a class appears in on your schedule. On your study list, there should be a [bar of color](https://i.imgur.com/27JYQ1p.png) on the top right. Click on it and a color palette will pop up for you to change the class color.

##Adding Your Own Schedule

You can add your own schedule to the schedule show on the Class Planner. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and you will see a section for [Personal Entries](https://i.imgur.com/cVQLqI5.png). Click add and you will be able to add your own things to your schedule.

##Plan Optimizer

If you're having trouble keeping track of which courses are offered at which times, you can have the Class Planner schedule your classes for you. Select the [Plan Optimizer](https://i.imgur.com/pBh5X4J.png) tab in between your schedule and Add Class to Plan tab. Click on [Options](https://i.imgur.com/1YaUQbS.png) to tell the Class Planner how you want your classes to be scheduled. 

Search for classes and move them into your Class Planner using the arrow buttons on the screen. Hit Go and the Class Planner will schedule your classes as close to the options you've selected as possible.

If there are any questions about enrolling please feel free to leave questions in the comments so other students can answer. If anyone else knows of any Class Planner Tips and Tricks they think should be mentioned please put it in the comments as well. 

If you have a question about which classes to enroll in or how to use your first pass units, ask your counselors, upperclassmen in your major, or on this sub."

For instance, last night my roommate was on a phone call for two and a half hours and I really just wanted to relax in the room but I couldn’t because they were being so loud, but I also thought it would be unfair to ask them to leave just because I want the room to be quiet... Eventually I was about to crawl into bed so I asked them to continue the call outside and they got annoyed and said that I usually go to bed much later. Which is true, but regardless I wouldn’t really want them to be on the phone in the middle of the night anyways, even if I wasn’t trying to sleep... is that fair or should I just suck it up?

I noted there are two GE subgroups under the second category. I think the policy is 
&gt;Courses listed in more than one category can fulfill GE requirements in only one of the categories.

So does that mean Chinese 50 can actually fulfill both area of Historical Analysis and Philosophical &amp; Linguistic Analysis since they are under one category?

Do people step outside to pound one out? Do the other roommates leave if someone is beating their meat? If the jerk goes on for a long time, is it okay to ask them to step outside?

For instance, last night my roommate was jerking off for two and a half hours and I really just wanted to relax in the room but I couldn’t because they were being so loud, but I also thought it would be unfair to ask them to leave just because I want the room to be quiet... Eventually I was about to crawl into bed so I asked them to continue the call outside and they got annoyed and said that I usually go to bed much later. Which is true, but regardless I wouldn’t really want them to be jacking off in the middle of the night anyways, even if I wasn’t trying to sleep... is that fair or should I just suck it up?

I would be really glad if some PhD students would be able to give me some insight on if it is possible to make ends meet with the stipend and other options.

I also have an internship lined up that’s 15-20 hours per week, so I need my classes on 2-3 days. I’m also a commuter. Is Econ 101, mgmt 1B, and a GE too hard on top of an internship? I’m kinda out of options because I only need 1 more GE. I also need 1 quarter of French, but it’s MWF so right now that’s not an option. 

The only thing that concerns me is I got a B in Econ 11, but i did get an A in mgmt 1A. So basically I suck at calculus. My only other B is in 31B, rest of my classes all A’s (no A- either). I’m a little borderline, and probably need a B+ (maybe B in 1B) in both classes to get into business Econ. Also, I took Woo for 1A and I know ravetch is impossible and way too much work. 

I think I can go to whatever discussion I want for 101, and since it’s a new prof I assume it won’t fill up. So I think I’ll use my second pass on that. 

What are the discussions like for 1B? Mandatory? If so I’ll use my first pass to get a good discussion and then whatever GE I want. 

Also another unrelated question: is 3 Econ/ mgmt upper divisions considered too hard? Since I’ll be done with GEs this is what my schedule will end up looking like later lol."

i have a hold on my account, and i cant enroll for winter. 

this is my first time actually receiving financial aid/grants (with loans on top, last year i was ineligible for aid based on my parents income). this fall i started with 12 units and dropped a class the second week because the entire class just seemed a mess, and I had a class like that last year that just threw me off. I tried enrolling into another class to replace this and did not get into it. (my schedule is really restricted because i commute and work a lot) so, i ended up with 8.0 units for fall. there is now an overaward charge on my bruin bill for up to $1,200. im assuming this is obviously because of my unit drop, but i dont have the money at all to pay for that. my parents do not help me pay for school or bills, i already had to take out multiple loans to help me cover the rest of my tuition, and im in a tough place financially... help.. i want to graduate on time and enroll for winter, but i highly doubt financial aid will help me in anyway."

I was reviewing my courses and creating a new schedule for the next semester when I saw something on ASSIST.org that made me really scared. There was a change in the math requirement for the transfer. 

Before the beginning of this fall semester, I used the previous UCLA transfer guide on ASSIST to pick my classes (it was for 2017-2018?). The requirement was that they required a year of Calculus and they listed Math 355 or Math 400 as options. I chose Math 355 (Calculus for Biology and Medicine) because I am a biology major and this specific course had a focus on biology. However, I checked ASSIST again today and I found that they updated a new transfer agreement for the 2019-2020 school year, listing only MATH 400 as a transferable course. 

So my question is: am I still able to transfer with MATH 355? I saw that UCLA was willing to take a Calculus course with life sciences, but for my school, there was no articulated course (before UCLA listed it as MATH 355). I am not sure what to do and I am really scared as to how this is going to affect my 4 semester plan, I would really appreciate your help. 

Thanks so much for hearing me out!

I am a tired soul. I wake up every day for my classes and study until 1am because I am desperate to get a good grade in this class to go to med school. I WANT THE LUXURY TO SHIT IN PEACE. If I coughed in the nearest stall when your ass entered, and you CHOSE to sit right next to me instead of the farthest stall, are you a fucking sociopath? Do you want me to give you a fucking high five under the stall? Do you want a Scooby Snack?  Do you want me to give you a fucking blowjob under the stall? And then when I am feeling awkward enough seeing your knockoff Yeezy's while dropping the biggest deuce of my life, you silently sit there and SNIFFLE while I pucker my asshole to hold in a fart because now I can't stand the uncomfortable silence. If you are going to sit next to me, you better have the biggest most fiery shit in your life, the kind that you get after eating too many Rende burritos. 

So in conclusion, if you see a pair of shoes in the nearest stall, sit in the farthest stall. The order of shitting in the stalls should go: 1) nearest stall 2) farthest stall, then the second nearest stall, then the second farthest stall. That way it is not as fucking awkward.

##**ANDRE 100% IGNORE RATE SPEEDRUN**

The trick to this speedrun is to get noticed as much as possible by Andre while maintaining your current walking rate. To do this, approach Andre on Bruinwalk, wait for him to engage you and politely decline any approaches while maintaining your pace. **Make sure your method of declining is consistent. If you say ""I'm late for class"" the first time, repeat it in every subsequent interaction.**

Do not slow down for Andre, if you allow him to finish casting ""Scam"", not only are you getting a slower time but he could permanently lower your score and this will increase the future likelihood of being approached.

To avoid the impoliteness/social anxiety debuff, try gearing up with headphones and make sure your walking velocity is roughly 120% of the average student through Bruinwalk. 

Try declining Andre roughly 2-3 times per week. There's a bit of RNG involved in this section but usually after 5 weeks Andre will remember you, your usual walking velocity and the method of denial. After you make Andre aware that you will never engage with him, he will start actively avoiding you. You are Andre now and the speedrun is complete. For fun, you could attempt pointing you finger at him and casting ""Excuse me"", there's a cool end-game easter egg when you do that.

I hope this guide was useful to all of you, I'm more than happy to answer any questions in the comments."

It's a red lanyard with a Hyundai car key and fob, about 4-6 house keys, and a red/blue/orange circular patterned woven keychain (pic linked below). There's also a Tile tracker on the keychain so I'll include a link to a photo of where they were last seen on campus (they appeared just south of Wilson Plaza on 10/24 apparently but they were lost closer to Janss Steps.

Appreciate any help anyone can provide.

First, I totally support everyone's right to protest, just please be respectful.

During my Midterm last week, the Trump/Pence Out protesters were in the court yard between Royce and Powell. They were ranting on a megaphone* the whole time we were taking our Midterm. It was very loud, very obnoxiously, and VERY disrespectful of every student on this campus who is here to get an education. On top of that, what they are doing is literally pointless since most people here don't like Trump, but also aren't extremist revolutionaries and never will be.

Anyway, they were back again today, on their megaphone*,  even after the last time when the police came and told them to get off the megaphone because they were being too loud (pretty sure someone filed a noise complaint).

We don't allow students to spew racist or sexist hate speech on the campus because it is disruptive to a learning environment, unconducive to leaning, and it isn't respectful. Maybe you agree with their message, but I think you can agree there's a difference is obnoxiously shouting it over a megaphone and handing out flyers or speaking from a soap box.

If the Trump/Pence Out protesters can't learn to stay off their megaphone and stop disrupting students who are here to learn and grow then they need to be barred from the UCLA campus. I respect they're right to protest in a way that isn't interfering with classes, however, if they can't figure out how to do this then they need to be barred from the campus. People shouldn't have to keep filling noise complaints every time they come on campus to remind them to be respectful of others.

So please, get of the megaphone and let me take my classes in peace.

So my HS grades weren't too hot but I've done good so far in college.

My GPA is 3.5

My current major is English, however I play to transfer into their television and film program

I'm heavily involved in three clubs, one being film, another being journalism, and the last being a student ambassador

I've also held two work study jobs and one job at Chic Fil A during this time.

I've also met their criteria academically, as well as personally via the aforementioned clubs and jobs

I'm trying to get some independent volunteer hours in as, but I have a few, some being an usher for a play and some of what the student ambassadors do counts as volunteer work.

Do I have pretty good chance of getting in?"

Both treatments involve repeatedly confronting feared sensations and situations, known as exposure therapy. One treatment focuses on methods to enhance the learning that occurs during exposure therapy, while the other emphasizes reducing fear during exposure therapy. Each of these therapies include components and therapeutic strategies that have been demonstrated to be effective.


Eligibility Criteria 

Individuals who seeking treatment for anxiety may be eligible for the study if they are between the ages of 18 to 65, are English speaking, are not currently suffering from major medical conditions, and are either un-medicated or stabilized on medications. 


 Screening Procedures 

Interested participants should leave their contact information (i.e., name, phone number, best times to call) at (310) 825-5614. Participants are then phoned by study personnel and asked a few simple screening questions. If eligible, participants are scheduled for an in-person, no-cost, diagnostic evaluation (approximately 2-3 hours) at the UCLA Psychology Clinic. 


Payment and Fees 

Participants will be offered 9 weeks of free treatment and a $25 Gift Card at the end of the study!


Treatment Procedures 

Treatment is conducted one on one, over 9 weekly visits at the UCLA Psychology Clinic. Assessments are conducted prior to beginning treatment, mid-treatment, at completion of treatment and 3 months later. These assessments include diagnostic evaluations, a battery of self-report questionnaires, behavioral observation, and physiological recording in a laboratory.

Description: Analysis of molecular symmetry and spectroscopy, aromaticity, aromatic reactivity, heterocyclic chemistry, chemistry of peptides and DNA.

I know there are tons of other posts like this but I'm just gonna add one to the pile.

I feel so sad and hopeless and stressed. I have great friends here, I'm involved in clubs, and I did pretty well on all but 1 of my midterms. Even so, I feel so much...less? than my peers. Everyone else seems to have done really hard classes in high school, and they'll be signing up for lots more this next quarter. They're involved in all these activities and searching for jobs and I just feel so inadequate compared to them. When I look outside people are laughing with their friends and going places but I feel like I always have to study.  Can people really understand all the class work without studying that much? I've always been a little slower at understanding some material, and that just makes me feel worse. I question why I'm a stem major more and more. I know my upper divs will be fun but the lower divs are really killing any love I had for learning. I love the arts/humanities (why didn't I major in them??) and it makes me mad that society shits on them. I hate this mentality of grind, grind, grind. If I'm not suffering, am I not doing enough? Should I be this stressed or am I just stressing myself out? Why do we have midterms, midterms, finals? I want a chance to breathe. I hate being constantly in this state of panic that I'm gonna fail even though I probably won't. High school was challenging but it never made me feel this way.

I don't know how I can do this for 4 more years. I miss my family and my home. I never get emotional or cry, I mean I never cry, and I've already cried 3 times this weekend. I just think about them and start tearing up. I wonder why I went to a school so far from home. I don't like LA at all. It's big and impersonal and unfamiliar. I've gotten tired of campus. Only one of my classes interests me in the slightest. I feel like I don't have time to take chunks out of my weekend to go explore since midterm season was here. I miss my friends back home so much and they all seem to be having so much fun in college. And then I feel like I'm not appreciating my time here, that I'm wasting this time in my life just being sad. I'm so lucky to be here. I worked hard to be here. People want to be here. My family and friends are so proud of me for being here. But I just want to go home. Is that an entitled thing to think? Should I just suck it up since I even get to have this opportunity?

I'll probably be fine after midterms, idk. Normally I'm a pretty calm person and I'm good at keeping my emotions in check and keeping a level head. But when I'm actually sad like this idk how to handle my feelings. This is probably a normal freshmen first quarter thing to experience, right? I just wish I could stop feeling this way and focus on my studies and stop feeling so hopeless and inadequate. I wish I could be more positive. It took me a long time in high school to build up self confidence and reassurance socially and academically, and ucla is slowly picking away at it. It's harder and harder to smile these days.

I don't know what I'm looking for but it feels a little better to write it down. I guess a question would be, does it get better? What are some better ways to manage stress and studying? Am I just making problems for myself thinking this way? Does it ever become less difficult to be away from home?

If you made it this far into my weepy rant thanks for reading. Just some thoughts I suppose."

For me, my transfer experience was quite rough and transitioning/adjusting to a new environment affected my studies heavily. I was caught off guard by the quarter system — getting behind in my classes by 1-2 weeks. This made me score pretty low on my midterms that even if I scored a raw 100% on my finals (plus a curve at the end), the best final grade I could get in my classes are maybe B/B-‘s. Realistically, I probably wouldn’t score 100% on my finals; I think I’ll get a C/C+ in my classes on my first quarter.

I want to attend a competitive engineering graduate school in the future and having one really bad first quarter will probably lower my cumulative GPA below a 3.5 no matter how superb I do in the rest of my quarters (I only have upper division left so there’s not many more units to complete).

My question is, if I purposely fail my classes, get put on academic probation,  but retake all my classes (at 16 units cap) and get all A’s through better preparation, would it be better than getting all C’s my first quarter (even if graduate schools may overlook one bad quarter)? What are the logistics of getting put on academic probation? Is it worth it and a smart move based on my circumstances?

Note: Having an extra quarter or paying extra tuition for the quarter “wasted” is not a concern at the moment."

But I am worried about the exam. Ive read on Bruinwalk that he evaluates on things that aren’t in the textbook... would that mean I need to go Baugh’s lectures ?

Basically I fucked up because I have a paper due tomorrow (technically today) and I am not finished with it at all. I ended class at 4 today so I thought that would be plenty of time to write a 4-page paper. Literally after 7 hours of work I have less than a page done. I wasn't playing games or on social media or anything like that. I wasn't talking to friends. I was just sitting there, unable to concentrate most of the time. I was just daydreaming about other things. The worst part is this is the second paper this has happened to me for this class. I got a 10% on the first one. I'm going to get a 0 on this I'm sure.

I'm not sure what to do at this point. I know it's too late to drop the class without getting my instructor's signature and approval from the college. I'm considering just being a ghost basically and not turning the paper in and not going to discussion. I'm too embarrassed to show my face after this. Then I would retake the class, unless I decided to switch my major. Given that this is a pre-req for my major and I can't get myself to write a paper for this class, it might not be the right one for me. 

Does this plan even make any sense? I'm scared to go through with it since I've never been in such a bad academic position, but it seems like my best option. I guess I could try to drop the course, but I feel like it would be unlikely. I have some mental health issues but I don't think that would be enough of a reason to let me drop. It would also be ideal if I could prevent anyone from knowing about this, but I suppose I can't have my cake and eat it too."

I would really love to have a greater understanding of the majors/minors before I decide whether to switch / add.

I am a sophomore applied math major student and am wondering if taking Applied Math and a minor from the CaSB department would prepare me as well as CaSB major. Since I have been in physical science, I'm missing practically all of the biology and chemistry classes pre-req classes and I'm not sure if I have enough time. The minors, however, don't require any life science core classes.  ([https://catalog.registrar.ucla.edu/ucla-catalog19-20-537.html](https://catalog.registrar.ucla.edu/ucla-catalog19-20-537.html)) Are the life science core content closely related thus necessary for the major classes ?

I also see that CaSB courses do not include a lot of upper division math classes. Do the methodology core classes cover linear algebra, ODEs etc that, in my opinion, are mandatory for quantitative analysis of biological systems? How about computer language/ coding? 

Thank you so much for answers/replies :)"

(leaving out the name for privacy since this post will have a lot of detail about me). But I just wanted to state it's not a community college so the classes are obviously of a different caliber. 

So, after this semester I'll have a 3.7 GPA with 67(semester) credits done. Including all math courses, physics, comp sci. Also materials eng, and statics. No C's lowest is a couple B's 

I'm prior Air Force, 4 years active, had a very mechanical/electrical driven career field, plus leadership position in my regular place of work. Plus I served a tour in the base Honor Guard, more leadership there. I know it's not a job interview but hey, I figured I'd put it here. 

Also I'll be using gi bill benefits of course, so hopefully that's a plus(guaranteed money for the school) and parents never graduated college, idk if that helps but yeah.

I also Co-founded and I'm the current vice president of an Aerospace club on campus. Club competes in annual competition for real engineering challenges. Leadership, initiative, experience etc... 

And I answered all the questions very throughly, basically maxing out the number of words allowed. Idk again if that's good. 
But it was all basically myself and situation... I came from a low income family, dreams of becoming and engineer but no money for school. So since grandfather was in army it inspired me to join and start at a smaller school, then work my way up bigger. You know probably a typical sob story but still true lol. But I wrote it as if I was telling a story that answers it, as opposed to bullet points and statements. Hopefully that's better!

Suddenly, some dude pulls up and asks if I can help him out, so, I hear out what he has to say. He says he had been driving from SF and had to be at LAX within an hour. He asked if I could help I deposit a check he had into my bank account through an ATM and give him the money. He seemed genuine, and being the awkward person I am, I reluctantly agree to help him out.

We head to the Chase on Westwood and Wilshire and he hands me a money order of 800 bucks. I have never used money orders, and rarely use paper checks, so I didn’t know how to tell if it was legit. So I put the money order in and give him $800 in cash. In my mind, the receipt said it added $800 to my account so it was legit. He thanks me and asks if I can do it again for another money order of $800 and for some reason I do it. So I do the same thing all over again, but only withdraw $200 since Chase has a $1000 dollar daily withdraw limit. He says he urgently needs to head to LAX so he asks for my email and says he will contact me about the rest of the money later. He heads off and that’s it. 

I check my app the following morning and notice that even though the money orders had 800.00 written on it, they were actually worth only $3 each. So I’m out a thousand bucks and have two -$797 transactions from Chase on my account. 

So as I write this post with pure sadness and embarrassment, I now realize how stupid I was. I wish I had just sad no :(. But I feel it’s important to share so that if this particular situation on campus happens to you, you know whats up. And take it from me, no matter how hard it may be, no matter how convincing or genuine someone seems, if something is telling you that you shouldn’t, think about it first, and don’t be afraid to just ignore or simply say NO. This is entirely my fault and I now realize how stupid I was for not thinking differently, but ugh, I dont want anyone potentially falling for this dude’s scheme.

This dude was an Italian male, around 6 foot (give or take) had grey in his hair and facial hair, spoke Italian and broken spanish and drove a navy car. If this scumbag tries to approach you, just ignore him or tell him to get bent. 

Now I’m left with a massacred bank account, rent due tomorrow and holiday gifts I cant buy loved ones all because my dumbass decided to help some scumbag on thanksgiving :(. Happy Holidays everyone"

It really was not looking good for me. I've been thinking long and hard about what direction I want to take in my life. I know I can succeed at UCLA because my first two quarters were okay, I even got two perfect A's in my second quarter. I was just in a horrible state of mind. I've decided that I want to go back and will do literally whatever it takes to get readmitted. I am already getting help for my mental health, and my therapist advised that I set goals and this is one I have set. I am going to quit my bullshit and buckle down and try to fall in love with education again. How can I go about getting readmitted, because I had heard so many different things on this subreddit. Some say its noncompetitive and easy, others say it is difficult and you have to take classes at the expensive UCLA extension, etc. Is it possible for me to get readmitted? I'm aware I will probably have to take courses at a cc to prove I can succeed academically. Thanks in advance for any advice!!!"

We only had one midterm before the final, in which I gotta 100% in. Also participation accounts for half your grade in the class, and I never missed a class either. So I have no idea how I gotta B+, given the fact I did all the hw too. I did the math before taking the final, and w/ the extra credit I did I needed like a 50% on the final to get an A (she offered a shit ton of EC towards the end too, and I did all of it). Problem is, I have no idea what the grade breakdown is b/c there's nothing in the gradebook except for my final grade. I've emailed her but have yet to get a response, I'm obviously hoping it was just a calculation error but I feel like it may be unlikely since there were only like 26 students in the entire class, so she knew everyone by name and knew how each one of us was doing in the class.   
So Im preparing for the worst, but I wanna know if anyone has had a similar experience contesting a grade in which they have few records of grades? How do you even prove you did certain things, and what not? I just have my graded midterm and a couple assignments w/ checkmarks (no scores, but she said she doesn't grade hw for correctness), but that's it"

You aren’t screaming out loud, but your eyes are screaming. The screams reverberating around the inside of your skull are making your irises quiver. I see it a lot, but it doesn’t get any less disconcerting. And by the way, this isn’t my fault; the exam is completely fair. All the questions – right up until me, the final question – have been given in class or on assignments, with minor modifications. (They literally just changed some of the numbers.)

You are angry with me because I’m not like the other questions you’ve seen. I’m an unfamiliar stranger who has arrived with the apparent intention of fucking your life up. Well, I am a little different, but you shouldn’t hold that against me. You’ll just have to think a little. And yes, I know, a calculus final is not really the time or place to be doing any serious thinking.

I wouldn’t be angry with the professor. It isn’t exactly making her day to see what the past semester of work actually amounts to. But, for the test to mean something, she needs to push you guys a little further and see how far your understanding goes. OK, OK, you are screaming with your eyes again. Look, why don’t you just start by drawing a diagram? Didn’t the professor beg you all a thousand times to start answering a question by drawing a picture? There you go. The curves are a little rough, but I can already see that you are a little more in control now. Ah – you’ve even started computing the points of intersection. We are dealing with a pro.

Getting back to what I was saying, I don’t want to get stuck into some elitist-slash-meritocratic claptrap, but if we present mathematics without the challenges, then no one is going to be walking away feeling satisfied. Just think how dope it must have been for Isaac Newton, a man with possibly heretical religious ideas and a creeping sense that the gradient might somehow relate to area, to stumble upon the fundamental theorem of calculus. Or for Pythagoras to wake up one day as a man haunted by triangles with perplexing little squares in one corner, but go to bed with a snazzy looking equation. Or for Euler to finally settle a popular pub argument in Koenigsberg by inventing graph theory and making the first foray into topology.

OBVIOUSLY, we aren’t looking for you to make similar kinds of breakthroughs. Almost no one makes those kinds of breakthroughs. Take a closer look at those breakthroughs, and you might find the reality to be a little more complicated. But you should still be making little personal breakthroughs. This is a big ask right now, but I swear that to solve me, the final question on your exam, you just need to apply what you were taught in lectures. On that topic, I’m pretty certain there was a formula that might come in handy right now. You’ll get a few points thrown at you just for writing it down. That is how needy the mark schemes are.

That is how you should see your prof: as someone who has been laying out in front of you a long trail of little breakthroughs.

That is a formula, but maybe you should consider another one.

Yes, we both understand that the formula was not the correct one. But it isn’t necessary to obliterate it from the page so thoroughly. A simple crossing out would suffice. Christ. The grader is going to imagine that you wrote something really obscene under all of that.

Great – that is the formula we were looking for. Now you’ll want to plug some numbers in. I don’t want to be glib about it, but there are only so many ways you can insert the numbers, and one of them will work. Well, yes, maybe. OK, that’s promising. And now we apply the fundamental theorem of calculus. Oh God, that isn’t an indefinite integral, so you don’t need that constant at the end. Fine, obliterate away.

I can see that you are one of those undergraduates who do arithmetic like you are reading a tarot.

You’ve got a final answer, which is good. Yes, put a box around it if you like. Or a big heart. Fine. I think the grader isn’t going to have any problems locating it. Perhaps you should go back and check all your arithmetic. You still have a good ten minutes of the exam left, and I know for a fact that you guys can usually pick up a good five points just by double-checking.

Or you could start drawing your favorite animé character on the back page. Up to you.

This obviously has taken a toll on my classes and two of those classes for which I have tried to keep up with I believe I will barely just pass. On the other hand I’ve been really behind on one class and I know for a fact that I will fail that class, I have seen a counselor which has suggested to drop this class (week 10) as not only no longer applies for my major ( I switched mid quarter) but also will lead me to retake it later on since I will have probably an F. I am just wondering if withdrawing will have an effect on my financial aid that I have been granted with? Will I have to reimburse UCLA for this class since I have withdrawn from it even though it’s week 10? Also I know I should have dropped earlier if things weren’t going well but some part of me thought I would be able to deal with these problems but I guess they got the best of me. I most don’t feel the motivation as I previously did to do much school work but I’m currently seeking psychological help for this.

Here I would like to share my own experiences and hope that would help people who having the similar concerns as me.

The reason I make this post is that about two years ago, I applied several UCs as a transferring CC student. I got several offers and filtered them up to two, UCLA Ling&amp;CS or UCI CS. 

I immediately started searching informations from online, but all I can find is theoretical or very general answers such as “if you work hard, you will get good grades and ended up with a good job as those UCLA CS student”, “if you really love computer science and dive into it, you’ll be able to do fine at UCLA”, “employers will hire you based on your actual skill rather than your college GPA”, and so on. 

All of such answers basically can be applied to questions such as “how hard is UCLA Ling$CS major?”, “I don’t have CS background and wanted to switching into CS field by taking this major. Will I be able to do fine?”, “Will UCLA’s reputation make you easier to be employed?”...

I felt that the theoretical answers are correct but not actually helpful. I wish I could hear more from people had take the exact path as me and see what they can do. Sadly, it seems that everyone who had the experience went into a black whole and never get a chance to come back and talk. All I can find from online are theories and guessing. 

I’m not going to say something like “if you want to find the job in the flag tech companies, you can make it by doing hundreds and thousands Leetcode even if you don’t have a high GPA and weak background. So go for it!!!”. I want to let you feel that it is worthy to be patience and read though this long post.


Now, I’m going to start from asking questions I had and answering them myself.


1. How hard is this major?
I’m not going to say it’s depends on individuals’ ability. I believe that there is a range about what overall admitted students can do, and they are admitted based on this standard.

It seems like impossible for Ling&amp;CS students to get A from CS31/CS32/CS/35L/Discrete Math. Although, theoretically, IMPOSSIBLE means “I’m possible”, the reality is that you would be in CS major and having none of the concerns that I encountered. At least, people who I know working really hard can get a B instead of C, D, or retake. I got mixed B and C too. Usually, A belongs to Engineering and CS major students. 

My grade basically consists of average A in Ling courses and average C in CS courses. My mixed GPA slightly above 3.0.  I did not work as hard as the first year I transferred in the second year, so I got a couple of D’s that balanced my one A and several Bs from CS courses. I don’t want to spend extra quarter to retake them. In other words, if you work hard constantly, I believe a 3.3+ GPA is achievable for a student with no CS background and weak in math(like me).

2. How many years OPT for international students?
I searched from online. The B.A. degree only has 1 year OPT, and the major CIP showed that this is not a STEM major. For double checking, I went to counselor in Dashew Center and got the answer is that this major is not valid for OPT extension. 

3.  As an international student with one year OPT, will you be able to find a CS related job with this major?
The answer is “yes” and “no”.

“no” part first, if you go to career fair, find your friends who got the job and refer you, and submit your resume to various hiring websites, theoretical you get the chance. Actually, you get a pretty high chance to be called or interviewed due to your school’s reputation. And the conversation will be like,
HR:  hello, XXX. I’m Hr from XX company, could you briefly introduce yourself.
you: ba la ba la...
HR: Greate, do you need sponsorship? 
you: If(yes){
             the interview is ended.
         }
         Else{
             HR: do you have permanent working authorization in the U.S.
             If(no)
                the interview is ended.
        }

By a pretty standard way of finding a job, this is the general idea about how the interview would be. Don’t panic and doubt yourself. This result has nothing to do with your GPA, coding skill, behavior, or whatever the online interview guide says. This is because you went into a wrong direction that leads your to a dead end. 

So, how did I find the job? 
The “yes” part is go to ICC! ICC is the worse case scenario for UCLA CS student, but probably the best case for Ling&amp;CS students. They won’t ask if you need sponsorship because they know you are coming for it. Instead, they train you and offer you a job with the chance to draw the H1B lottery with taking a deduction from your income as their profit. ICC stands for It consultant company, Indian consultant company, or whatever good name for you. It’s a big industry that constantly seeking coding labor with a very little salary(little for CS jobs, still big for other jobs). The famous ICC such as Marlabs, Infosys, and other ones pay about 60k-70k per year for entry level graduate students. I heard that due to Trump’s policy, Infosys is no longer eligible for sponsorship this year. 

Anyways, this kind of big consultant firms usually have a high standard. They have requirements such as master degree/stem majors/...

Where I went to, as a 3.0GPA student, is a middle sized CCC(Chinese Consultant Company? We made the name). The ones I interviewed are Sita life, Antra, Itlize, and BHT. The pay range is around 55k-65k. I went to one of them. 

The separation of CCC and ICC is not the point of view from a racist or based on my bias. It does not mean Indians have to go to ICC and Chinese have to go to CCC. They are all open to all people from all countries. The separation is based on how the way they works. Besides waiting for the HR to send you an email by filtered all the candidates from the hiring website based on your major, school, GPA. Chinese people use WeChat as the communication tool, and lets say, I can directly refer you(you are welcome to DM me if you are interested. I really want to help bruins as more as I can) to the HR for scheduling an interview via WeChat. I’ve being referred by the previous person too, and the HRs are happen to let me refer the next person to them. So, this way could be inherited by following generations of international students. Eventually, the network is built. On the other hand, Indians have their own networking and ways to be connected. In this case, they get a higher chance over other people from other countries. 

The situation for the industry is like early Chinese immigrants started this kind of business in recent years in order to help Chinese international students, just like Indians help their own compatriots. 

The problem is that almost all the ICC headquarters are in New Jersey. It’s been very expensive for them to come to California, so students here are hardly getting information about this kind of companies and think they are fraud. 

I spent way to much words to talk about ICC here because I believed most International students like me have a strong bias to this industry. .

Anyways, I’m going to end this topic in a short sentence, in reality, this is probably the most possible way for most non-outstanding CS students without permanent working authorization to get a CS related job. 

4. Would I be able to get into a CS master program with this degree? 
Absolutely yes, even if you have a weak CS and Math background. I’m going to provide some key words here, and feel free to do your own research:
(1) NYU Tandon School Bridge Program for Computer Science
(2) John Hopkins Computer Science
(3) University of Chicago Computer Science
(4) USC
...
Those are the ones I found myself, and I took the Bridge Program as my backup plan.

If anyone have more ideas, please leave comments. I’m planing to go to graduate school if either I am not able to win the H1B lottery or I earned enough working experience:)

5. How is UCLA Ling&amp;CS and UCI CS major?
Let’s back to our main topic now. I would only say things based on my experience.

Usually, student with a similar range of academic ability will be given this to options. I personally think that an international student go to UCI is a more realistic and better choice, because it has 3 year OPT.

But, if you are not aim for 3 years OPT, I would recommend you go to UCLA. Like me, I planed to go to graduate school no matter I get a job or not after graduate, so I picked UCLA.

The benefit of being a Bruin has being discussed a lot, so I’m not going to talk about it.

What I would like to high light here is that among my Community College friends having the similar academic ability as me and when to UCI. They end up could not find a direct hired job and when to ICC too. So, this is kind of a prove of employers having a fair way to judge and filtering the candidates that having different level of abilities. 

With all being said, for OPT —&gt; UCI
          Don’t care about OPT —&gt; UCLA."

I’m a third year transfer, and I’m definitely not a perfectionist, but I still studied myself into sickness because I wouldn’t stop studying. Even in retrospect, although I’m currently sick as a dog, I still think the amount of hours studied was essential and neccesary to obtain satisfactory grades.

My mental health is perfectly fine, I don’t really get overwhelmed with the “stress” of getting good grades. I just know how much I need to study, and I study that amount. However, entering UCLA, that number of required study hours to achieve good grades has skyrocketed, and while I’m willing to invest these hours, my current sickness is making me rethink the viability of forsaking my physical health in return for hours studied. 

However, going forward, if I’m to have healthier study habits (sleep more, take more breaks, etc., essentially study LESS), I feel like this would then cause “stress” because I would knowingly hurting my (long term) GPA in return for better (short term) physical health. 

So really, reading over my past text, my dilemma is not unique in any way. It’s the classic “balancing physical (and usually mental, tho not for my individual case) health, and education”

I've done the calculations for my final grade for the course, and I think getting those 2 points would actually make the difference between an A and an A+.

It'd be amazing if I could get an idea of which are useful/essential, and the level of difficulty I should be expected from them.

Trust me, as someone who has been a part of the program before (and would never willingly be a part of it again) there are much better ways to make a difference on campus. Firstly, your experience in the program really just depends on whether you’re liked by the “professional” staff which is why you may hear some people say such positive things about their experience and hear others complain about theirs. The staff has no morale. The staff works insane hours (many of which aren’t paid but are rather “compensated” through housing which is technically illegal in California but they’ve found some special wording that makes it legal in their work contract) and despite constantly working your butt off, you will hardly receive positive encouragement and only constantly be told what you (the staff collectively) are doing wrong. Although constructive criticism is great, this professional staff literally doesn’t know how to thank you for your hard work. If you suffer from mental health I am warning you, DO NOT JOIN THIS PROGRAM. They don’t care about your mental health and everything they preach all summer applies to everyone but their own staff. For example, they constantly tell the new students about how even though they’re in college it’s important to, “get 7-8 hours of sleep,” meanwhile the staff is constantly running on very little sleep. Every year they get complaints about mistreatment by the professional staff and simply just brush it off with a mediocre apology. Seriously, you’re better off working at a coffee shop over the summer (you’ll be a lot happier).

so I started freshman year pretty badly and it just went downhill from there. I took a course load of Spanish 2, Health, Honors Algebra 2, Honors English 9, PE, and Bio this semester. I got A's in spanish, health, and PE. I got a B+ in biology, and a B- in english. However, I got a C- in honors algebra 2, which i'm very concerned about. Is it okay if I messed up this semester, but consistently get A's each semester after this for admission to UCLA? (including good extracurriculars, SAT and ACT, the like). Also would you have any suggestions for me, and what I can do to get into UCLA after this semester?

btw next semester i'm going to drop down to regular algebra 2

He joined the class a day late so he was marked off points for that one absence. Because participation was worth a lot in this class, the difference ended up being an entire letter grade, so he went from a B to a B-. He never missed an assignment b/c of this absence, he just got points taken off for missing that extra day. 

He had another absence in addition to this, but one absence alone would have not dropped his grade.. it's b/c the professor marked off the extra absence on the first day of class, before he had enrolled. He already talked to the professor in person but he said he was not going to change it (and he gave him a grade breakdown and this is for sure the reason why his grade dropped). Is this a common occurrence? I always thought, within reason of course, a professor does not penalize you for days you missed before enrolling in the class. They usually have you do any assignments you missed, but I've never heard of absences actually counting for those days if attendance matters in the course. I understand if you joined over a week late, or if you missed a discussion, but being marked off for missing just the first day because you were not enrolled yet seems a bit excessive. He emailed the professor too as soon as he joined the class to see if he needed to make-up any assignments, and he said he doesn't need to. Of course he never asked if the absence would count tho. 

Also this class started on week 1, not week 0, if that matters"

tl;dr first bc this post will be long: Hosting an LGBTQIA hackathon the weekend after week 3 (allies welcome!) — help us by signing up to hack/mentor or sharing us on social media

Hi r/ucla! I’m part of the organizing team for QWER Hacks, UCLA’s first LGBTQIA hackathon, and this will be our first year hosting this event. We hope that this event will increase the visibility of our queer community in STEM and give y’all opportunities to network with companies working towards increasing diversity in tech. Hackers of all levels (and all identities) are welcome - we will be holding workshops throughout the entire hack meant to help beginners learn about different aspects of developing.

Diversity is becoming an increasing need in the tech field, especially in machine learning and AI, so we’re inviting speakers from Queers in AI and the Trevor Project to speak at our event and sponsor prizes for projects that are geared towards increasing mental health and diversity.

Since this is our first year hosting this event, we’re asking for help to publicize our event. If you have the time, feel free to follow us on social media, share our website to your friends, or even sign up to hack/volunteer/mentor!

I’ve talked to my department advisor about getting more aid or something if possible, but I don’t have many high hopes since I’m out of state, even though financially it is impossible for me to come next year. I’ve also looked at scholarships to apply to within UCLA and there are verrryyy few available for out of state students. 


I definitely do not want to leave at all, as I think I’ve made some great friends and love being a Bruin. However, I just cannot fathom having to take out an obscene amount of loans in such a short period - it’s very troubling. I think that my best option would be to transfer out, applying as a transfer student this year for next year’s fall semester at some school that can hopefully grant some aid.


I did summer quarter and finished with a 3.6 and will finish with 3.7-3.8ish this quarter. I’m mainly just wondering how I go about transferring and which tier/type of schools I should be looking to transfer to if it’s a good idea, as there could be other options that I have not explored yet.

She is brand new this quarter so there is no Bruinwalk page on her and I imagine it'll be a few quarters before she gets a page so that's why I'm writing it here. I just finished EEB 109: Marine Science with her. Don't know my grade yet and don't really care since I'm already accepted to grad school but I imagine it will be one of my lower ones during my time at UCLA. 

Her class is a steaming pile of garbage. She just reused someone else's slides (her mom's?) so she didn't even know what was on the slides. She'd constantly click to the next slide and go ""Oh... I don't remember this"" and have to try to decipher the slide in the middle of lecture. There was a lot of vocab and things she didn't know so she had to ask the TA's during lecture since they knew better than her. 

Her exams sucked. Her questions fluctuated between being way too vague (fill-in-the-blank where you could think of 5 potential things that fit) or way too specific (asking for one specific fact that was mentioned during one slide during one lecture.) She posted learning objectives that were supposed to help us prepare for exams but she'd constantly make questions that weren't covered by the learning objectives.

She was rude to students, I heard from many people they'd approach her outside of class and say ""Hi! I'm in your EEB 109 class!"" and she'd be like ""Um... do I KNOW you?"" (Dumb af, there's like 200 students in your lecture so of course you don't know them.)

Her mom is a UCLA professor who is apparently well-respected so I'm low-key convinced she got this job because of nepotism. Avoid her classes like the plague, unless she miraculously turns things around within a few quarters. I'm just posting this here for any EEB students who type in ""Caitlin Fong"" in the search bar within the next couple of months."

Does that mean that they'll start charging me for my full loan in 6 months or will I only owe the amount of the loan that has been disbursed to me so far?

It’s my common knowledge that I will be placed on academic probation and subject to dismissal. Does anyone know if this necessitates that I must take less than 12 units next quarter? (I need at least 12 for my financial) or does it just mean that I really have to do better next quarter or else I’m in serious trouble but that I can still commit myself to 12 units if I’m serious about trying harder. 

I will definitely speak with a counselor (psychology dept) once winter break ends. But in the meantime, I also ask again for your personal experiences and whatever words of comfort you can give me.

EDIT: I just went into my Applewatch's ""Penis Touch"" counter. I went back to the day of my exam and during the exam time, it showed that there was 0 touches at all.

I had a cellphone in my seat faced down but didn't even look at it or touch it once throughout the exam. The professor himself said that he did not witness anything but since I've been reported by another student, then he will be referring me to the Dean of Students for resolution. A TA even came by and answered some of my questions in view of loona but didn't make any comments about it. I did not stan loona, as I would rather fail than to be a kpop stan, but what's the process now? Naturally, I will deny any wrongdoing, but I have a few questions regarding the process now:

1. What happens when you meet with the Dean of Students? What does s/he say to you?
2. Are you assumed to be innocent until proven a kpop stan?
3. Is the burden of proof on the accuser/professor?
4. I know that if the Dean of Students determines that there is not enough evidence, then they can dismiss the case. How likely is this, especially if it's just hearsay from another student and the professor or TA didn't see anything. ([https://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/Portals/16/Documents/flowchart.pdf](https://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/Portals/16/Documents/flowchart.pdf))
5. Would it be possible to offer to retake the final exam or oral interview for the exam to show that I actually know my stuff? Would this help my case to prove that i did not stan loona?
6. What is the best way to prove my innocence, especially since it's just hearsay from everybody?
7. Am I able to cross examine my accuser or even know who accused me?

EDIT: I didn’t bring a backpack to any of my finals that day. I only had my bulletproof vest, my champagne glass, and my clipboard. The clipboard kept falling out of my vest (I got a pretty huge clipboard) so I just picked it up as the exam started and put it down on my seat without a second thought and continued with my exam. At no point did I touch the clipboard or even look at it.

EDIT: I just went into my donation logs. I went back to the day of my exam and during the exam time, it showed that there was 0 activity for any donations or ATM withdrawals or any suspicious questions asked of bossmen at all. It also showed that I received zero dollars during the exam. My clipboard has every donation that I have ever received and records of every student stopped, so this is irrefutable evidence that I did not solicit donations."

This is also not a copypasta. I am just a CS freshman freaking out right now. It would honestly be great if a TA or anyone with prior experience share their advice or pm me. 

So a couple of days ago, all CS31 students received an email from Smallberg regarding CS31 asking us to confess if we violated the academic integrity. I did end up using Github for one function for a project since I was right on the deadline and I couldn't figure it out.  Looking back, I probably should have just taken the L. It was one of the earlier projects and I made it a point not to do it again in for future projects. I have read some past Reddit posts about CS Smallberg emails and that it is a hoax. Most of them are saying its a fluke or how just deny confession all the way. 

However, I have some reasons to believe they know for certain. I am wondering if I should just confess before they even told me they caught me and hope they will give me a light sentence or I should wait until they notify me and confess then. I really don't want to risk it by continuing denying it and be sent to the student committee. Regardless, the email said I will be sent to the dean of students. 

If anyone can tell me more about the process, especially for Smallberg, and the possible punishments and punishments handed out in the past. I read online that no matter what I do it is at least a two-quarters suspension and even expulsion. It will be great if someone can shed some light on this situation. If you don't want to disclose or remain anonymous, please just send me a PM and I will definitely keep everything private."

Some of you may have already seen my previous post on wanting to switch into math and all that but let me expand. 

I just transferred from CC after two years and after this quarter I realized that I am not as interested in my current major as I thought I would be. Math has been something Ive really enjoyed in the last year or so and Ive realized that it is likely too late to do anything abut it here. 

The only thing I could potentially see myself doing is submitting a leave of absence and returning to CC (For about a year) and finishing the few math classes I need to take. Would this route even be possible? If someone returns after x amount of time are they allowed to switch majors? Any sort of advice would help!

egh4fk,On gym etiquette for new year's resolutioners and returning users,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/egh4fk/on_gym_etiquette_for_new_years_resolutioners_and/,meat_crayon_420,1,2019-12-27 13:22:31,16,/r/ucla/comments/egh4fk/on_gym_etiquette_for_new_years_resolutioners_and/,NaN,"Please be reminded of gym etiquette and how to be considerate. I usually just do my own thing and am not bothered by others, but there are certain things that just scream, ""I want attention"" or ""This is the first and only real gym I've ever been to."" Thus, I've compiled a list of do's and do nots at the gym whether you're new or simply unaware.

For everyone:

1. Re-rack your weights. If you are strong enough to pick them up, you are strong enough to put them back. 

2. Don't hog weights. It's really annoying when you've got one workout left, but someone is hogging the weight you need while not even using it and when you ask, they defensively say, ""I'm using it."" Your heart rate goes down, you lose your pump, and you're already tired by the time they finally give it up. 

3. Don't workout in front of or on the dumbbell rack. I mean, really? By doing this, you're commuting 1-3 douchey acts. You are blocking people from grabbing weights, putting weights back, or walking past you.

4. Don't slam heavy ass weights on the ground. We are taught by personal trainers that if you can't put the weight down comfortably, it is too heavy for you. So many people slam weights down as if it's some sort of accomplishment, when all you're doing is triggering people's anxiety/tinnitus or letting them know you don't really know what you're doing. 

5. Don't post up on your phone. Checking an email while you're resting between sets is totally OK, but sitting there for minutes on end before doing your next set is just rude and self-centered. This goes more for when people are waiting on you, but in general, it's not a good look. 

For newcomers:

1. Welcome! If you are unsure about how to do something properly, ask staff or another gym goer. For the most part, people are not terrible and totally glad to help you. 

2. Don't take on more than you can handle. Going too hard in the beginning is a recipe for inconsistency. Make your workouts manageable and grow your workouts with your body. All it takes is a really hard workout to spiral into prolonged days of soreness to discouragement. 

3. No one cares about what you're doing and that's empowering. It can be super intimidating and embarrassing to come to a gym for the first time, but realize that most people are concerned with themselves, which offers you the freedom to focus on yourself. 

4. Read the instructions on machines and do a quick internet search on proper form. Many of us think working out is something that comes naturally as the idea of picking up something heavy and putting it down is seemingly obvious. In reality, there is a right way and a wrong way to do everything and doing things the right way requires practice and constant monitoring. There are minute long videos on almost every workout allover the web. Do a little research beforehand to save yourself from injury in the long-term. 

5. Know your fitness goals. If you want to be more active, great, you're killing it. If you're trying to gain mass, lift heavy and manage your protein intake. If you're like most who want to lose weight and feel good, know that you go to the gym to get fit and you go to the kitchen to lose weight. You cannot out train a bad diet. It takes a candy bar, four oreos, or a handful of chips to squander your workout. Be smart and be safe. 

OK y'all, that's it! I'm really not tryna be preachy or condescending; I'm a former personal trainer (and current ucla student) and I just really think some people can benefit from this info. All rules can be summed up as, ""just don't be a dick,"" which most aren't. Happy new year, see you at the gym!"

Decided 2019 was the year I changed that status before the new decade came around. 

Became friends with a very beautiful lady along with a group of other Bruins. Struggled through the same classes and also partied through the highs and cried through the lows. Summer school together was only bearable because she was there taking the same classes as I was. 

Decided it was time I make a move and reveal that my feelings have ignited, starting from a small spark into a huge fire. But what could I say or do? Blurting it out is no fun. I can't sing for my life nor do I have the money to hire a singing coach. Can't really play guitar as I can only play the basic chords. Hmm...

I remember vividly the day she shared her life story. I could hear the sadness in her voice, but it was the silent emotionless expression of sorrow on her face that screamed the loudest. I could rarely see the smile on her face throughout the days, yet when she did, it was the prettiest thing she wore. 

And thus, I embarked on a ruthless journey, to re-ignite my childhood passions of drawing and coloring, and draw a portrait of her, smiling. Not that I was good at drawing, but I was determined. I saved up whatever amount of money I could gather through my summer job to purchase a Strathmore 400 Series Drawing Paper Pad, some colored pencils, and art pencils for shading. Contacted my art major friend to teach me the basics and help me correct the imperfections of my lines and shapes. Fall quarter goes by, she doesn't suspect a thing. 

Through many trial and errors, many hours of preparation, I finally completed a fairly accurate portrait of her, smiling, and nice sunny UCLA background. 

I didn't want to distract her from her studies as it was the peak of the latter weeks of Fall Quarter. We got through finals and it was finally time. I tell her that I have a gift for her as a congratulations to getting through another quarter. Knees weak, arms heavy, heart pounding, I lead her to my place where I unveiled the product of my labor. 

She looks stunned and laughs, laughing with the same smile as the one I had produced with pencil and paper.  I tell her it was for her, that her smile was beautiful and it makes me happy. Was it a success?

She turns to me, laughing, and says ""Thanks bro, you can keep it though since it makes you happy and I don't have much space in my room!"" At this point I revealed my true intentions and it turns out she actually has been talking/dating someone else from a different school (a school close to UCLA, but not as good as UCLA if you know what I mean ;) ). She said that perhaps if I told her a couple weeks earlier, things would've been different but now it's too late. At least for now because she's fully committed with her current relationship.

We're still friends (rip), I have no hate towards her at all, it's her decision and I respect it. We hung out over break a couple times. I will probably smack myself for the rest of the year for trying to be a romantic fool but you live and you learn. I let her tell her friends the whole story and she let me tell the story to all of my friends. It's been weeks since it happened so we all laugh about it now and nothing is weird between any of us so it's chill.

Anyways, Bruins, don't be like me and waste your quarter learning how to draw for a girl. Just let her know asap. I will retire on my artistic endeavors and never draw again :). Press F in the chat. Happy holidays and happy soon-New Years, I hope you find better success than me. Cheers!"

# Abstract

This is a guide/list of comments that I believe would help other prospective CS35L students excel in the class. I've learned a lot about the class through talking to my classmates, and a lot of the knowledge I was told wasn't well known to me at the time. I think other students could benefit from this. 

Also included are suggestions I think could highly recommend to others, as this class can be really rough.

At large, I highly recommend future students either

**a)** Before the quarter starts, knocking some of the more difficult assignments out of the way.

**b)** If the quarter already started, working on some specific assignments ahead of time.



### Side Note

I feel a lot of this may be obvious to some, but I sure as hell wish I knew this going in.

## Other (about me)

I'll state my inherent biases early on, as well as other information you should consider before you take this as gospel or dismissing me like an idiot (please don't take it as gospel). Just because I struggled doesn't necessarily mean you will, and just because I found another assignment easy doesn't necessarily mean you will too. 

- I got a B in the course.
- I'm a community college transfer student, and this was my first course.
- I have a fair amount of programming experience via running an open-source project online, but I lack industry experience.
- I consider myself somewhat of a slow reader/learner.
- I took 18 units this quarter, coupled with this class being treated like 7-8 units (from what the TA's described day 1), so I felt more strongly and negatively towards this class in general (it felt like I was taking 23-24 at times). 
- I'm pretty biased against this course.

# Class Structure

## Content and Difficulty

The class is set up to be non-cumulative, meaning each week is (for the most part, with exception to two assignments) independent of each other. This can be a double edge sword - you generally have to learn something new really fast each week, but if you fall behind, the previous week is behind you.

The TA's remarked the class goes in reverse difficulty - the most difficult assignments come first. I'll list the assignments that are the most difficult (to me, and the TA's), as it's a major part of how I think students should prepare. 


## The Final

For those uninitiated, the final pretty much involved 150 students or so printing out as many resources as they possibly can, which includes printing out every slide presented by a specific TA, and hoping to find the answer in a binder. I'll leave some remarks for stuff that helped with me on this part, and stuff that I wish I had done.

Various classmates found resources that were useful for the final, such as older study guides from previous years. More on this later.

# Study Tip 1: Preparing for the Assignments Ahead of Time

I was told the best way to prepare for CS35L was to do it over the summer and take in the fall. I wish I knew that, but here are the main reasons why. I met a really smart student pretty engaged in CS who recommended this to me, as well as some other bruinwalk commenters. 

## Why Prepare for the Assignments?

From what me and others have experienced, CS35L is the class where, you think you're nearing completion, but it turns out that one last specification they added at the last minute that's required in the homework ends up taking another 2-4 hours to do, and you can't skip that requirement because it's 10% of the grade. Then you have to check the piazza, where the TA's clarify some of the specifications on the day of submission, and you need to re-adjust your code at the very last minute. 

It was uncommon for students to turn in their homework 2-3 days late after suffering the 2^n day late penalty, and now are N days behind on the next assignment. Throw other midterms into the mix, it gets chaotic, especially for a few select assignments that coincide with midterms By starting early on the more difficult assignments, it's easy to avoid this 2-3 day overdue problem, where it puts you behind on the next weeks homework and studying time for other classes, especially since these assignments are due around midterms. 

Moreover, if you want to check if your code is working properly / want feedback, the TA office hours for the various assignments get cluttered as the turnin date approaches, and it is difficult to find out if your code is working the way it's supposed to. Avoid this mess by starting the more difficult assignments early: considering the class isn't cumulative, it's advantageous to do these assignments before that hectic weeks occur. 

To re-cap my thoughts

- A lot of assignments go overdue, even for the more experienced students, causing a **2^n** point penelty for **n** days late, and causes you to be **n** dates behind on the next assignment
- The more difficult assignments coincide with midterms
- TA office hours get crowded as the due date appears.
- Specifications/requirements change the last minute, which is stressful.

## The Difficult Assignments (and my justifications) 

These are the assignments I believe people should start working on ahead of time. I and many others personally had issues with these, although ymmv.


[2. Shell scripting](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall19/cs35L/assign/assign2.html):

The average for this assignment was 77%. I found the most difficult aspect of this assignment was testing the code since the specification asks for the student to run it on a large directory. Getting the recursive part of the code working was pretty confusing as well. Also, as the turn-in date approaches, the school's Linux servers generally slow down, and its super stressful waiting for the script to run as the school's Linux servers are overloaded. My code didn't even work fully, and it took 50 minutes to test my script the night it was due. It was super unnerving just watching the clock tick, unsure if my code crashed or not, knowing I was eating away at my time.

Most students I met turned this one in late. 

[4. C programming and debugging](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall19/cs35L/assign/assign4.html)

The TA straight up said, ""ok, this week's homework and lab is super hard, so I won't lecture much today and will focus on giving tips"". This is generally regarded as the most difficult homework (that and # 5 I believe).  The average for this assignment was a 76%, and I didn't get it back until week 12 (after the class ended). It's ironic that week 5's homework is contingent on this homework working correctly, I didn't know my submission failed some important cases (which affected week 5's cases also). 

The main reason I recommend starting early is since, C memory management is tricky to work with. Segfaults are fucking annoying to deal with, especially with it being so compiler heavy, at one point I had one set of code that would not run correctly on 3 different linux machines (my local system, lnxsrv04, lnxsrv01). I'm not sure if this was exclusive to me, but I had issues where the code would sometimes throw segfaults on one school server, but not another. 

I find this assignment worth going to office hours for to verify your code will hold for other testing conditions - although my code worked for the sample input / output, it didn't work for the other cases. 

Most students I met turned this one in late. 

[5. System call programming and debugging](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall19/cs35L/assign/assign5.html)

The mean for this homework was 76.7%. 

Like I said, this homework was continent on homework # 4 working correctly. The reason I found this homework to be extremely difficult was the awkward test cases they asked students to use, such as growing/shrinking a file during the execution of the program, and the extremely heavy memory management one needs to use. I believe they recommended using GDB to artificially pause the program, so you can nano into the file and make it grow / shrink during runtime. Idunno, it was super weird and disorganized. 

Most students I met turned this one in late. 

[9. Change management spelunking and implementation](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall19/cs35L/assign/assign9.html)

lol I wanted to spend time with my family over thanks giving and didn't start this until I got back. I think this homework will probably get dropped (sorry Zhou, I feel like you lurk here on reddit, but this homework was hard as shit).

Half the class got low 20's, half the class got low 80's, resulting in the average being around 50%.

I'm not going to comment too heavily on this one since I don't think it'll return next year. 


# How to Prepare Ahead of Time

## Prepare Option A: Before the Quarter.

This is what I was told what to do before the quarter started, while the quarter was going on. I discounted this idea as being a genuine possibility, but if I had 2-3 weeks to start working on these select assignments earlier on, would of saved me from long nights of last-minute coding. 

## Prepare Option B: During the Quarter.

This isn't ideal as I would typically just suggest doing them before the quarter starts, but if it's too late, this is what I would of done. 

At this point, since working on the assignments before the quarter started isn't an option, I recommend scheduling your quarter like this:


Week 1: Do Assignment # 1 Quickly, then Start Assignment # 2.

Assignment #1 is do-able and is more straight forward than #2, which is why I recommend doing it in this order. Also, considering #2 can take an hour or two to test when all the 150 other CS35L students are using the schools linux servers, getting ahead of this can save you the night(s) it's due by not testing assignment #2 the day it's due.

Week 2: Start Assignment 4

If you finished #2 already on week 2, getting a head start and making sure assignment 4 works correctly will be advantageous. Week #3's homework had a high average, and isn't worth working ahead of time for. 

Week 3: Start Assignment 5.

Like I said, week #3's assignment isn't that hard, just finish it early and after assignment #5 is done the class is more smooth sailing. 

Week 8: Start Assignment # 9, although I believe they're going to change it next quarter again. 

My motivation behind this is that weeks # 1 is fairly light, and it's a great time to get ahead on assignment #2. Use the time you got ahead by doing week #2's assignment ahead of time to get a head start on # 4 and # 5, since week # 3 is more manageable in comparison to #2 and #4 #5.

## Other Prep, Dual Boot Ubuntu-Linux

having linux on my system allowed me to run alot of the labs and homeworks locally and was able to code all the assignments without having to SSH in since I just did each weeks homework through my local terminal rather than SSHing. I found it much more comfortable working on a desktop enviroment than SSH, and I thought it was rather advantageous to be familiar with ubuntu-linux ahead of this course.

I still had to SSH in to verify it worked on the schools computers, but there were very few exceptions when they differed in outputs. 

Furthermore, if you're preparing for this class but don't yet have a seasnet (ucla ssh) account, running ubuntu 16.04 should be identical (I will need to verify this myself) to what the servers are running, so you can test a lot locally. 


# Preparing for the Final


## My Thoughts

Eggert's finals seem to be pretty notorious to study for, and I have to agree. (Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/eeg2fc/this_is_what_happens_when_you_study_20_minutes/) 

Like I said, the final consisted of 150 students prowling through their notes looking for the answer to a really specific and oddly worded question. I scored 3-4 points above the average on the final, but I think I could of done better if I had more time. Here's a picture of my cs35L final binder: https://i.imgur.com/SJ7pcVq.png

I think some will debate me on this section, but here's some stuff I felt helped 

## How the final is made

The final is made by the TA that graded each weeks homework. It was recommended to print all the slides from each respective TA's week, as they're the ones who made the question for that problem

## How I prepared

### Powerpoint to notes

I used the linux (I don't think it's specific to linux) tool pdftotext to convert the power points into a plain text form, and used markdown + stackedit to format the notes into a LaTeX like document. A picture of my notes can be seen here:

https://imgur.com/a/qcHyFrm

I personally thought, although time consuming, to be useful. Rather than looking through each powerpoint slide in **N** time to find the answer to a question, I was able to reduce it to **N / 4** by having a table of contents to search through ( stackedit automatically makes these), as well as being nicely formatted helped find the answers faster.

The god Eggert himself remarked that our final was longer than it was intended to be, and sort of just chuckled, but I found I had an issue writing complete answers to each question. I still ended up slightly above average, though, so to each his own.

Considering one of the questions literally involved us to write a make file, using pen and paper, each minute counted. 

To re-iterate why I think preparing notes in this way is useful (I'm in a hurry writing this):

- Time is a huge issue on the test. Imagine writing a make file on a test, and then having to scroll through 30-40 slides to find what you're looking for. 
- I was able to find the answers to a question much faster on the notes I had markdown'd, since stackedit automatically produces a table of contents, which proved valuable when time was an issue.

### Finding other resources

There were some problems where having a cheat sheet was really useful, like 'git cheatsheet' which tells you what to do in the event of ___ conflict, or a quick guide on how to use ReGex with examples. I'm not going into too much detail since it's pretty self explanatory.

### Labeling my Binder

The person next to me didn't label his binder, and I saw how much more hectic his note-searching was. Considering the final wasn't really a final and more how well your printed out the notes and were able to find the specific answer to a question you were looking for, having my notes labeled and sticky noted for key sections was a great time saver. 


## My recommendations

### Make your binder entry for a chapter each week, not on finals week.

Rather than just printing shit out stupidly like me and many others did the night before, I could of better organized my binder and found better, more concise resources to use by making each weeks binder entry throughout the quarter, instead of all at once.

My main reasons are:

- Each week, you know what you don't know intuitively, and making a collection of notes + resources you don't understand quite well is easier when it's fresh
- I really thought having the markdown'd notes improved my grade - I think I did better on the sections I had good notes for, rather than just printing out each powerpoint slide (I ran out of time on finals week, so I only had mark down'd notes for half the class).

### Have your binder organized

- Searching through the binder knowing the answer is in there somewhere is pretty stressful, and we had 1.8 minutes per point I think, so having the answers easier to find would probably allow you to do problems not many other people completed just due to time constraints (notably the programming questions, honestly fuck writing C and makefiles by hand).
- If I saw a question about git, it was a big time saver simply going to my binder tab labeled 'git shit', looking at the table of content for 'merge conflicts', and finding the page for how to handle merge conflicts, rather than searching through all **N** pages, I reduced to log(**N**) or something by having everything nicely labeled.


## Closing thoughts

I sort of rushed this guide, if people think its useful I'll come back to it, but I'm unsure how useful my notes will be to others.

I'm fairly slow of a learner so keep in mind I probably did more than most other students have done."

On the day we moved in, Brian told us he was gay and me and Joe were perfectly fine with it. But the thing is that Brian was \*gay\* gay. He hung up this humongous rainbow flag in our room that takes up like 25% of the wall space and it's embarrassing to bring other people in to hang out because they think we're a gay throuple or something. He even has a bowl of penis-shaped candies on his desk. He regularly snacks on them and offers them to us, but we always politely decline.

This morning I woke up and my face felt kind of heavy. When I wake up I usually rub my face to kind of clear the particles out of my eyes, but this morning my hand came back covered in a sticky substance with the consistency of Elmer's glue. Because I had just woken up and was not consciously thinking, I tasted it thinking that would help me figure out what it was. I figure out right then and there what it was... I rushed to the bathroom to wash it off.

I haven't seen  Brian yet today because I've been avoiding him but I don't know what to do next. Should I report this to someone? Should I confront him about it?

I'm a pre-health junior who is really struggling to find a major that fits my interests/that I enjoy.

I originally planned to apply and finish my undergrad as an HBS (Human Biology &amp; Society) major, but unfortunately was not admitted.  Being more naturally ""talented"" in the humanities, I decided to try and find a North Campus major that I would 1. graduate on time with, 2. perform well in, and 3. enjoy. So far, I haven't had much success. 

I am currently on track for Sociology, but honestly speaking I don't enjoy the major.  I was really excited to take more health-related courses (e.g. global health, community health, etc.) offered by HBS, but again I was not admitted and many Sociology upper division content does not really pique my interest content-wise.  To compound the issue, I had a late enrollment time and all of the Sociology upper divs are full.

I have respect for all studies and while I know that a lot of the majors being offered here are great programs, I'm stressed out over the fact that I'm not enrolled in enough major courses and that I don't have a sense of enjoyment from what I'm studying if that makes sense.   

Is there anyone who's a soc major who might be able to help me out on what I can look forward to/classes to take, or other majors I might be able to finish in time?  I have a lot of interest in foreign language, international relations, health (e.g. comm health, public health, etc.).  If you have any suggestions I'd be happy to listen because I am so stressed at the moment with the quarter right around the corner!  Thank you and happy new year guys!"

Since I’m a freshman (not junior or senior standing), I can’t enroll in any of the internship classes advertised through the UCLA Career Center or the internship class through the Economics department.

How do UCLA students typically pursue unpaid internships as underclassmen? Anyone have experience with this or know of a loophole? Should I try requesting a letter from the school saying that I’m in good standing and this internship is an applicable learning experience? Or try to petition my way into an internship class?

Thank you so much for your help!"

ejoyln,Has anyone been scammed into going to UCLA urgent care unnecessarily after trying make an appt with their Doc?,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/ejoyln/has_anyone_been_scammed_into_going_to_ucla_urgent/,ez90404,0,2020-01-03 16:56:57,7,/r/ucla/comments/ejoyln/has_anyone_been_scammed_into_going_to_ucla_urgent/,NaN,"A couple months ago, after working out I felt a twinge in my abdomen and thought it was possibly a hernia.  I called my doctor's clinic, which is part of UCLA Healthcare.  My appointment costs a $10 co-pay.

The woman on the phone said my doc wasn't available that day (a Friday) and there were no appointments at the clinic available.  She asked if I would like to talk to a nurse.  I said, sure.  The nurse seemed nice and thoughtful.  She asked a lot of questions.  After about 30 minutes on the phone, she concluded that I was suffering from diverticulitis.  I told her that of the 4 symptoms she named, I was only experiencing one.  It seemed to me that the most prudent course of action would be to wait out the weekend, see if any of the other symptoms presented and come in Monday to see my doctor.

She emphatically reiterated that my potential problem could be severe and suggested that I go to the UCLA Urgent Care facility near my house.  I balked.  I really didn't think her diagnosis was accurate -- especially given that it was over the phone and she was a complete stranger.  But she continued to stress the potential risk I could be facing and that if any symptoms presented over the weekend, I would have to rush myself to the emergency room.  I didn't agree, but she was the ""nurse from my clinic,"" a professional; so I went.

90 minutes later, one medical exam, one blood test and one urine test, the doc pronounces me healthy as a horse, no symptoms of anything whatsoever.  I think to myself, ""Wow.  Go UCLA Health!  That was great.""

Then 4 weeks later, I get a bill for $1,000 for my visit to urgent care.  Insurance reduces it down to $382.  So instead of a $10 co-pay for a visit to my doctor, I was charged $382 for something I didn't want or need until this UCLA Nurse misdiagnosed me and pressured me into going.  Then I find out that the Nurse wasn't actually part of my clinic.  When you call to schedule an appointment at UCLA, it goes to a general number.  If there are no appointments at your clinic, they try to bounce you to a nurse to convince you to go to Urgent Care.  It's a SCAM to UPSELL YOU, and it's one of their standard practices.

When I tried to contest the charges, they offered to reduce it by 1/3. Why, I wonder...? I'm guessing because they know it's a scam. When I refused to pay the charges for the above stated reasons, the person on the phone refused to let me talk to her manager.  Her defense...?  I availed myself of Urgent Care's services.  It's not the nurse's job to tell me there's an extra charge.  Really...?  The nurse ostensibly works for UCLA.  She know their system.  Why didn't she inform me of these potential costs...?  Oh, right!  Because then I would not have gone!

When I pointed this out, the woman on the phone insisted I write a letter, which I did. No one ever responded, and the bill has now been sent to a collection agency.

I thought this was maybe a random act, but the EXACT SAME THING just happened to my buddy.  Apparently, this is what UCLA Health considers good health care.  Go Bruins!!!

Tl;dr -- Instead of making a $10 co-pay visit to my doctor, a Nurse at UCLA unnecessarily convinced me to go to Urgent Care where they billed me $382 after insurance."

""Okay, so, given that we're at a pretty special and reputable university, one of the best in the country, I have found it common to observe that, regardless of where I go outside of Berkeley, people generally react with admiration and praise upon learning where I go to school. For instance, it is not uncommon for me to observe displays of pleasant surprise, rising eyebrows in admiration, or for them to mouth the words ""wow,"" denoting, obviously, an acknowledgement of Berkeley's academic pedigree, reputation and all the implications about one’s personal ability, intelligence and IQ that accompany attendance here.

I've grown accustomed to these reactions. I would be lying if I said I didn’t feel little endorphin rush each time I received such praise. If I’m being completely honest, I seek opportunities where I can name-drop Cal into conversations with individuals whom I’ve just met so that it raises my personal stock in their eyes. After all, it feels good to be smart and be acknowledged as such. Usually, simply uttering the name Berkeley is all it takes for the person I’m speaking with to change their disposition and begin treating me with a little more respect.

This is the case about 90% of the time.

The other 10% can be divided into two cases: people who don’t know much about college rankings or colleges in general, and the second group is UCLA students. Typically, these people will learn that I am a Berkeley student and not bat an eye or show any added respect. The person in the former group will simply ask what I'm studying, usually. I don't take offense to these folks because I attribute their reactions simply to a lack of information. The latter group, however, the Bruins, tend to say things like, “Cool, what are you studying there?” or “How do you like it there?” or “What’s your major?” without any facial expressions that convey acclamation for the fact that I attend Cal. 

In fact, I can’t think of a time when a Bruin treated me with the same instant high-esteem I’d expect from 90% of people I encounter. This is starting to bug me more and more given that they're obviously familiar with UC Berkeley and what kind of institution it is. Whereas the first group's excuse is that they are simply ignorant on the subject, I haven't figured out why UCLA kids don't react the same way as students from other UCs and the general population.

I have probably encountered dozens of students, throughout my travels across the state during my three years at Cal, from every UC campus. All across the board, from UC Merced to Riverside and even UCSF, students from these campuses show instant respect and display kudos and are generally impressed when they learn that I’m a Golden Bear. This is true for every campus except UCLA.

And I’m left wondering: Do you think they do this on purpose? What possible reason could they have for not reacting like 90% of the population does? It’s pretty perplexing. It’s been bothering me lately—particularly because I went back to visit my grandparents in SoCal over break and ran into UCLA students all over LA county. Their reactions, upon hearing what school I attend, showed the same neutral faces or light smiles as before I uttered the Berkeley name. Their orientation to me didn’t change at all. There were no raised eyebrows accompanied by ""oohhs."" To be honest, I'm not used to this.

When I meet a UCSD student, for example, they typically show a lot of respect and light up. Many of them become excited with lots of questions about attending Berkeley; barring that I have somewhere to be, I tend to stick around, sharing what life is like at Cal. But with UCLA students, I never experience this at all. I feel like maybe they don’t know their place in the pecking order? I understand if this comes off as super petty and perhaps a little pretentious, but I wanted to see if anybody has had a similar experience. If so, what did you do about it?"""

Proceeds to walk down the stairs and continue talking  and when the prof is finally able to get him to leave on him way out he looks at her and does the guilt tripping “It’s an organization to help children whose parents have cancer, I’ll just leave the flyers here”

Why does this Camp Kesem kid think he’s so entitled to the professor and everyone in the classes time? It seems the camp is a good charity/org but shit like this really ruins the image of the org for a lot of people and I don’t think this kid considered that.

He asked me where the nearest library was to expand his infinite knowledge, so I pointed him in the right direction. He then proceeded to tell me that he is a Berkeley student, so I said “Cool, I’m a UCLA student.” He told me that I didn’t understand what he was trying to say and got aggressive, repeatedly telling me that he is a Berkeley student. I asked him what his major was, and his face got red with fury. “DON’T YOU UNDERSTAND? I’M A BERKELEY STUDENT!” he ejaculated towards me.    
I dodged and once again, I told him “Cool” and then I proceeded to ask him how he likes it over there. At this point, literal steam started shooting out of his ears. He then proceeded to yell “YOU FUCKING LOWLY UCLA STUDENT, DON’T YOU KNOW THAT I, A BERKELEY STUDENT, AM SUPERIOR TO YOU! BOW TO ME!” His eyes started glowing red like he was charging up a laser beam. I shrugged and turned my back on him when I suddenly hear an otherworldly shriek coming from him.  He then commits the ultimate cardinal sin by yelling out “USC is better than UCLA!”   
I’ve had enough of him by then. “Forgive me, Joe Bruin, for what I must do.” I took out my trademark UCLA cock like a baton and then I started beating him to death with it. I 8-clapped him onto the ground with the power of my Bruin dong. By the end of it all, there was just a pool of blood on the ground.    
Well, now I need to know if you guys think if I went too far, and if I’m an asshole.

el0t0g,There is a serious lack of respect from Berkeley students and I just have to speak up,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/el0t0g/there_is_a_serious_lack_of_respect_from_berkeley/,chocolatechip420,1,2020-01-06 13:39:23,3,/r/ucla/comments/el0t0g/there_is_a_serious_lack_of_respect_from_berkeley/,NaN,"""Okay, so, given that we're at a pretty special and reputable university, one of the best in the country, I have found it common to observe that, regardless of where I go outside of UCLA, people generally react with admiration and praise upon learning where I go to school. For instance, it is not uncommon for me to observe displays of pleasant surprise, rising eyebrows in admiration, or for them to mouth the words ""wow,"" denoting, obviously, an acknowledgement of UCLA’s well known record setting penis size average, girth and all the implications about one’s personal sexual prowess, libido and the wide extent of the carnal experiences that accompany attendance here.

I've grown accustomed to these reactions. I would be lying if I said I didn’t feel little endorphin rush each time I received such praise. If I’m being completely honest, I seek opportunities where I can name-drop UCLA into conversations with individuals whom I’ve just met so that it raises my personal cock in their eyes. After all, it feels good to have a magnum dong and be acknowledged as having one. Usually, simply uttering the name UCLA is all it takes for the person I’m speaking with to change their disposition and begin treating me with a little more respect.

This is the case about 90% of the time.

The other 10% can be divided into two cases: people who don’t know much about college rankings or colleges in general, and the second group is Berkeley students. Typically, these people will learn that I am a UCLA student and not bat an eye or show any added respect. The person in the former group will simply ask what I'm studying, usually. I don't take offense to these folks because I attribute their reactions simply to a lack of information. The latter group, however, the Bears, tend to say things like, “Cool, what are you fucking there?” or “What is the average penis size there?” or “What’s your favorite position?” without any facial expressions that convey acclamation for the fact that I attend UCLA.

In fact, I can’t think of a time when a Bear treated me with the same instant high-esteem I’d expect from 90% of people I encounter. This is starting to bug me more and more given that they're obviously familiar with UCLA and what kind of institution it is. Whereas the first group's excuse is that they are simply ignorant on the subject, I haven't figured out why Berkeley kids don't react the same way as students from other UCs and the general population.

I have probably encountered dozens of students, throughout my travels across the state during my three years at UCLA, from every UC campus. All across the board, from UC Merced to Riverside and even UCSF, students from these campuses show instant respect and display kudos and are generally impressed when they learn that I’m a Bruin. This is true for every campus except Berkeley.

And I’m left wondering: Do you think they do this on purpose? What possible reason could they have for not reacting like 90% of the population does? It’s pretty perplexing. It’s been bothering me lately—particularly because I went back to visit my grandparents in NorCal over break and ran into Berkeley students all over Alameda County. Their reactions, upon hearing what school I attend, showed the same neutral faces or light smiles as before I uttered the UCLA name. Their orientation to me didn’t change at all. There were no raised eyebrows accompanied by ""oohhs."" To be honest, I'm not used to this.

When I meet a UCSD student, for example, they typically show a lot of respect and light up. Many of them become excited with lots of questions about attending UCLA; barring that I have somewhere to be, I tend to stick around, sharing what life is like at UCLA. But with Cal students, I never experience this at all. I feel like maybe they don’t know their place in the penis size order? I understand if this comes off as super petty and perhaps a little pretentious, but I wanted to see if anybody has had a similar experience. If so, what did you do about it?"""

When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me.

I made this throwaway account because I know I would forever catch shit for it if I were to post it from my regular account given that many people know my username. I must also mention that I am only speaking for myself here; it's my personal opinion, not the university's. But I digress.

What I want to talk about is the complete lack of respect for UC Berkeley on this sub. I mean, seriously, what gives? Perhaps it's the comfort of anonymity that emboldens you all to talk the trash that you do but realize that it's honestly pathetic and sad that you're sitting there attacking the top ranked UC and my sole reason to live; and then criticizing someone who attends said top rank UC. How about this? GROW UP. You people aren't in high school anymore. It's time that you show some respect. Berkeley is the best and you know it. I'm genuinely puzzled as to how UCLA students could see themselves as equal to me. You don't have anything better to do than refuse to change your disposition and begin treating me with a little more respect ? Seriously, I feel sorry for you.

I know a lot of you are too dense to realize that UC Berkeley is the top ranked UC, but  I've grown accustomed to feel a little endorphin rush each time I received such praise from strangers. Not only is it cool it’s normal to the point that I’m incensed to talk to UCLA students. People who've heard about UC Berkeley show displays of pleasant surprise, rising eyebrows in admiration, and for them to mouth the words ""wow,"" denoting, obviously, an acknowledgement of Berkeley's academic pedigree, reputation and all the implications about one’s personal ability, intelligence and IQ that accompany attendance here. And no, I'm not just talking about nearby wealthy residents. People from all over za warudo know UC Berkeley. Think about it, people: hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of people worldwide just knowing how smart I am. Is this how you want people to view UCLA?? People defiant of our clear superiority? Think about my ego sometimes people. 

Were some of you so capable and intelligent growing up that you don't just recognize my value? If you weren't, what would your parents think about you acting this way to your betters?

I've talked to UCLA students sometimes and wow, the only thing I can say is they're extraordinarily rude and ignorant. They are mind bogglinglyy presumptuous, hilariously nonsensical and immature. I honestly can't believe that students not at one of the world's elite institutions are saying things like, “Cool, what are you studying there?” or “How do you like it there?” or “What’s your major?” without any facial expressions that convey acclamation for the fact that I attend Cal. Did a bunch of frat bros brigade this sub or something? What exactly is happening here? I only speculate that that's what's going on because I know there can't be such a large contingent of disrespectful people on here. It must be a concerted effort on the part of the people who said such rude things to me, which I believe is coming from those involved in Greek life. I just can't fathom how there could be another explanation in light of the the level of arrogance displayed here.

Do yourselves a favor and knock off the ""equality"" crap. It’s unfair to UC Berkeley students. It’s unfair to me who had to listen to your drivel instead of getting home to watch Rick and Morty, a show that I'm sure is too intelligent for you.

For those of you who think I sound like a conceited asshole: nobody cares. We are supposed to be better than you. You ought to know your place in the pecking order

And finally, learn to respect your superior students. I know you all think we at UC Berkeley are students just like you you, but guess what, we’re not. We’re the best students.  Do you do this on purpose? What possible reason could you have for not reacting like 90% of the population does? It’s pretty perplexing. It’s been bothering me lately—particularly because I went back to visit my grandparents in SoCal over break and ran into UCLA students all over LA county. Their reactions, upon hearing what school I attend, showed the same neutral faces or light smiles as before I uttered the Berkeley name. Their orientation to me didn’t change at all. There were no raised eyebrows accompanied by ""oohhs."" To be honest, I'm not used to this. 

 I understand if this comes off as super petty and perhaps a little pretentious, but I had to get it off my chest."

the board approved of the idea as a recruiting method because we were honestly tired of standing out on bruin walk doing to same ol' thing as every other club. it was creative, funny, and unique. But boo hoo, we're so sorry it took literally 1 minute out of your precious class. boo hoo. why don't you just relax people. seriously, it's the first week. we are literally out here trying to bring people together to serve a group of kids whose PARENTS HAVE CANCER. do any of you even know what thats like??? i highly doubt many of you do. so it just makes it look all the more stupid. unless your parents have cancer then you honestly should be more sympathetic. the truth is that it's hard finding good people who will stick around until camp time. so we need to be unique in getting the word out.

for all of you who thought it was stupid: we ended up getting 68 people so far who are interested in joining. that's 27 more than as the same time last year. and we strongly believe that it's due to our new promotional efforts. we will continue to raise awareness about our clubs until we hit a number we are satisfied with. if it happens to be your class that it's in, then just sit down, relax and let other's who might be interested in joining listen. you might even get a chuckle out of it. it's a creative approach."

elhu03,My roommate is taking on a north campus minor purely for the jokes,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/elhu03/my_roommate_is_taking_on_a_north_campus_minor/,RagerOnStrathmore,1,2020-01-07 13:12:03,37,/r/ucla/comments/elhu03/my_roommate_is_taking_on_a_north_campus_minor/,NaN,"So my roommate is a math major and constantly cracks jokes about north campus majors. I’m a north campus major. It started off as nothing too serious because we go way back to high school and they’re mostly light-hearted jokes he tells. But occasionally he grazes the line with some of his remarks. He’ll say stuff like, “Haha, it must be nice to get an A just for showing up” and “I didn’t know you could major in being unemployed.” I’ll admit, I crack jokes back and this dynamic we have shouldn’t make you think that he’s in any way, shape or form a dick. He’s a great friend and I love him. But he does push this one button from time to time; he’s a saint otherwise.

But like, one of my classes last quarter required that I watch movies at home and write about them. So when he’d show up to the dorm and notice me doing my hw (watching the movie) he’d say stuff like “oh, I see you’re inundated with HW. Must be stressful haha.” Because of the remarks, when I’d see him doing his Math stuff all stressed out, I legit would start to feel bad that I only had to watch a movie and read a couple chapters that night, but I tried not to let him phase me.

Anyway the jokes kept coming and one day I finally told him straight up that I had enough of the jokes. I told him they were inappropriate and that I didn’t want to hear them anymore, that they were hurtful. This caught him by surprise and it turned into a tense moment for a sec. He admitted he never knew I felt this way but that I was overreacting. I told him again how I felt and after a bit of bickering back and forth we settled down and came to an understanding. He agreed to stop making jokes. In an effort to diffuse the tension I joked that he could only make those jokes again if he became a north campus student. We laughed, and he didn’t tell another north campus joke from them on.

Fast forward two months and now I’m learning that he’s suddenly pursuing a History minor. Keep in mind that I knew this kid in HS and he HATED humanities classes. But now all of a sudden he’s talking about taking history and classics classes and getting a minor in History. Wtf. Where did this come from? I asked him about and he gave me this vague explanation that he suddenly realized he loved humanities over winter break and now wants to study it. I honestly think it’s total BS.

To top it all off he’s now started making jokes again. He took what I said literally and said that because he’s now technically a north campus student, he can make the jokes. And that if I get mad it’s just because of my insecurities. So now everyday he walks in with a new stupid, hacky joke. It’s getting on my nerves. He thinks he has full reign to make the jokes because of his minor. And they’re seriously some of the oldest, hackiest jokes I’ve ever heard. He’ll walk in and say shit like “How do you get a Philosophy major off your front porch? Pay for the Pizza” or “A sociology grad walks into a Bar. He then heads behind the counter and starts serving drinks.” They’re not even funny jokes. This idiot literally texts shit like this all the time now.

The only joke that was the ever remotely funny went like this:

&gt; A teen is telling his parents what he wants to major in.
""I want to be a history major,"" he says.
The dad responds, ""No you don't! There's no future in it!

My question is whether I can report him to the history department or something. I know this sounds crazy but I think they’d be interested in knowing that one of their students is making a mockery of the field and doing it purely for the jokes. He doesn’t actually care about history. I’m sure there’s some mechanism that could allow them to revoke his application for the minor and not confer the title on his degree. After all, he’s doing it under false pretenses and for reasons against the spirit of inquiry and intelectual pursuit. Can this be done?"

Aggie alum here and I am looking for a few excellent tutors for my small friendly boutique educational company.  I specialize in making the learning process fun and centered around the young human being you are working with.  I am looking for fun, energetic, high EQ people who are great with kids...even the challenging ones!  

Although your academic background is important, the most important quality I'm looking for is relatability.  If you have that and can teach elementary-high school subjects you are a great candidate.  It is important to note that many clients need help with math and science subjects so proficiency in those areas is a plus.   

To apply for this job you should be:

\-able to manage your schedule and be prompt

\-able to work late afternoons and weekends

\-have transportation to travel to clients

\-be able to commit to your clients through the end of the school year (and beyond hopefully!)

 Please DM me telling me a little about you and/or your experience with children and teaching.

Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm interested in a room swap for the rest of this school year. My personality, etc. differed quite a bit from my 2 roommates (but in particular, one of them), which has led to many tensions within our room over the fall quarter -- something I would definitely like to avoid for the next 2 quarters.

&amp;#x200B;

Specifically, I am a very study-oriented person. As such, I tend to prefer silence when I am studying in my room. I also am a light sleeper, and my sleep quality vastly improves when the room is dark and quiet (I do have an eye mask, earplugs, and a white noise machine, however). However, my roommates (one of them in particular) enjoy talking on the phone, playing videos through phone speakers, etc., making it hard for me to study (and even sleep sometimes). During the fall quarter, I brought up those differences with my roommates, but the issues never got resolved, even when escalated to the RAs -- my roommates refused to change their personality. 

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, I was wondering if anyone here who is a heavy sleeper and/or someone who isn't such a tryhard studying person like me would like to swap rooms with me. My thinking is that there probably are some people out there who are irritated that their roommates are too study-centric, want too much peace and quiet, or are light sleepers.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Looking for a potential room swap with someone who is more social and a heavier sleeper than I am

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I'm a guy, currently living in a plaza triple shared bath.

&amp;#x200B;

P.P.S I'm not entirely sure how the roommate swap process works; can someone who knows this process kindly explain it to me? Thanks!"

I can't wrap my head around the fact that people in college are doing so much more than studying. Back in my time there I always had my head in a book!

When I discovered Reddit a year ago while cooking meth in my basement. I figured it’d be nice to see if my alma mater had a community that I could talk to while my wife was ghosting me. I searched and found this community and subscribed accordingly. I was expecting to see lively discussions about Plato's allegory of the cave or maybe even someone looking for help with chem homework. Instead, I learned about ""MEMES"" and 9-inch schlongs.

Among the many things about this subreddit that make me uncomfortable, I am particularly bothered by literally anything funny or that might make me feel insecure. Someone shared something about penis size. Posts about size are the worst. I swear I am normal size though. Seriously, I am. All of my friends that go to Berkeley told me I was when I sacrificed my foreskin to the Berkeley bear. Anyway, didn't mean to be tangential, back to my complaints.

All I ask is that we stop having fun online. Posts about large penises are so loved by everyone here? Seriously, I don't get it. They're not that great or funny. Psh, what does that have to do with studying at UCLA? On the one hand, a student will be voted down for asking a genuine question about a class or professor. On the other, someone bragging about masturbating on campus garners 200 upvotes and is subsequently gilded? I did that and all I got was arrested! Why? - I think it is important that we have a discussion about our manners and values; this is not what I was accustomed to when I was a student. Ugh! College isn't supposed to be fun.

If it is too much to ask for fewer memes, could we perhaps make them more appropriate? Maybe give a meme out to those small penis guys. They have feelings too! Or so I've heard. Some of the jokes really hit hard when you're locked in your s/o's basement and she is feeding you beans through a mail slot in the door at the top of concrete stairs. I enjoy a humorous post as much as the next person, but there’s a point where it is too much. I cannot stand to see another dick joke. I will literally cry.

Imagine, someone from the UCLA administration logging on to this community to learn that these hot young guys also have big dicks. How will they resist them?! I know I speak for many older alumni who would rather see this place be boring and affirming of the fact that they went to college at the right time.

I know the current Chancellor had an AMA here a while back; it kills me to think about the possibility of him logging on and reading that people like big penises. SO GROSS GUYS. It may be funny to many of you who are current students and are a bit young. But these things have implications outside of school, everyone is going to be funloving and safe sexually. You'll remove the stigmas that hold back society. Progression is bad! I've decided I might be an asshole and SNITCH ON EVERYONE AND TELL THE ADMIN.

Perhaps I'm an ""insecure piece of shit"" like my wife says, but I hope that we can have a genuine discussion about the direction (not erection) of this subreddit because, currently, it it makes me sad.

Thank you for reading.

I just don’t understand the strange bubble that is /r/ucla, particularly because of all the academic and often intellectual discussions.

When I discovered r/ucla a year and a half ago I figured it’d be nice to see whether my university had a community that I could visit and contribute to. I searched and found this community and subscribed accordingly. I was expecting to find hilarious memes and rants about academics and student life at UCLA. Instead I’ve been let down and made to feel uncomfortable by the slew of legitimate UCLA-related discussions that permeate this community.

Among the many things about this subreddit that make me uncomfortable, I am particularly bothered by the following: Posts about study groups; discussions of particular professors' teaching styles; posts requesting advice on how to pass certain classes; extracurricular advertisement posts; discussing UCLA athletics; and, one I’ve had trouble deciphering, loneliness / mental health posts. This is all in addition to a slew of random inquiries I would classify as ‘other,’ which are constantly posted here and tend to drown out genuine attempts at comedy.

All I ask is that we please try to cut down on this sort of content and focus instead on things more pertinent to teens and young adults, and that we conduct ourselves in a more laid-back and whimsical manner. Why is it, for example, that posts about struggling with mental health are so ubiquitous here? What does that have to do with studying at UCLA? On the one hand, a student will be voted down for making a derogatory meme about a class or professor. On the other, someone bringing up the issue with a certain aggressive club recruitment on campus garners 200 upvotes and is subsequently gilded? Why? I think it is important that we have a serious discussion about our manners and values; this is not what I was accustomed to when I wasn't yet a student.

I therefore urge you all to please think about what non-bruins, alumni or aspiring students who visit this subreddit might think upon seeing all these posts made in bad taste. What impression do you want to leave on these individuals? I would hope it is not the current one based on the academically-focused content we have floating around. There is a lack of refinement in many of these posts that I don’t believe they are conducive to expressing True Bruin values.

If it is too much to ask for fewer discussions, could we perhaps make them more enjoyable to read? I enjoy a serious post as much as the next person, but there’s a point where it is too much; and far too often that line is crossed by users on r/ucla.

As Money Magazine's 3rd highest-ranked public college and one of the most selective institutions in the country, should we not strive to present ourselves with more dignity and respect? Imagine, for example, someone from the UCLA administration logging on to this community to see what students are up to only to see a constant stream of insolent posts that attack an UCLA icon, such as that chicken walking around campus or the Camp Kesem (I am aware that Camp Kesem does not approve of the recruitment methods employed on day 1 of this quarter). I know I speak for many younger students who would rather see this place be inclusive for students and future students alike, no matter how old or how long some of us have until we're in college.

I know the current Chancellor had an AMA here a while back; it excites me to think about the possibility of him logging on and reading that strange tome about the student and their mental health issues. It may not be as serious to many of you who are former students and are a bit old. But these things have implications outside of school. This why I’ve brought up the matter with my local Greek life chapter, and we’ve discussed the possibility of drafting a letter to the administration to urge them to take control of this subreddit and install an oversight mechanism to better moderate and institute higher standards of comedy on here. My opinion is that, unless standards of conduct are met, this subreddit is due for a huge revamp because, personally, I believe the content here is too serious and professional for genuine Redditors like myself to feel comfortable.

Perhaps this seems a bit drastic, but I hope that we can have a genuine discussion about this direction of this subreddit because, currently, it is not a welcoming space for new Bruins. It is my hope that we can reach a consensus about what needs to be done to clean this place up.

So usually on Saturdays my roommate does his laundry and goes to bfit/eats at de neve afterwards. This means that for about a two hour block he's out and about on the hill doing stuff, which means I get the room for myself. 

I usually just sleep in and don't really take advantage of it because I either lay in bed or study a bit. But today I decided to take advantage of having the room to myself by watching something on our TV. So as soon as he leaves, I get up and fire up my laptop so I can stream onto the tv. I had the sound on and everything. It was a porn movie. Anyway, I start playing the movie and then head over to my closet to grab some clothes while the movie plays in the background. And lo and behold I hear my roommate at the door and then two seconds later barges in. I guess he had forgotten the tide pods. By then I was kind of in shock cuz there wasn't enough time to run and turn off the movie and he walked right into an Asian anal gang bang on our TV. It was so embarrassing. We just kind of looked at each other shocked and I could see him holding back his laughter and finally he said ""sorry dude"" and left closing the door behind him.

Luckily, it was only the movie playing and I hadn't started doing anything else. But it was so embarrassing! Fuck. He ended up leaving for a couple of hours extra. So, he was gone for 4 instead of his usual 2; most likely it was because of the awkwardness. I really don't want him to tell anybody on our floor because we are all pretty close and this is really embarrassing. There's this girl I like that we are both friends with and I have a feeling that's going to tell her. I feel like he's already told some people about me watching a porno movie and I'm really embarrassed to go outside. 

Should I bring it up with him or pretend it never happened? Ugh. I can't believe that happened. I wanted to die. But hey, I guess it could've been worse. Had he walked in two minutes later he would have literally walked to see me with my dick in my hand pumping off. What should I do? Should I talk to him? And what if he's told everyone already? I don't wanna be known as a ""porno"" guy, especially around that girl I like. I wish I was closer to my roommate so I could bring it up like friends do, but we're not that close and I feel like he's spreading the rumors already. This sucks."

I feel like these types of posts are uncommon this early in the quarter, so feel free to ignore the rant

I feel like I am starting out this quarter already burnt out. I haven't even gotten overwhelming amounts of homework yet (and I assume the situation will only get worse when I do), it's just that I have absolutely no motivation to do it.

I think the logic being used by my last few brain cells here is that I can somehow prevent this quarter from starting if I just don't do any of the work? I spent last quarter studying for 6-8 hours every day (hence the burnout) and had no work-life balance whatsoever (not that I ever have, but it was especially draining given that it was my first time living away from home so I didn't even have my family to talk to on a daily basis). I think the idea of repeating that for the next 10 weeks is contributing to my dread of this quarter.

Also I don't feel like I'm motivated by any goals larger than not failing my classes? (and graduating on time). I'm not working towards any specific career and I have essentially no goals for my future. Basically I'm just spending the last few years we have left to stop climate change becoming stressed over classes that won't matter to the minimum wage job I'll probably have after graduating (unless I go to graduate school. But I can't even imagine the accumulated burnout by then)

"" Summer aid is only awarded for 12 units. you may take more than 12 but you will not be awarded additional aid. At 0 efc you may receive enough to cover 12 units but not more. there is no fee for dropping a class but if you sign up and drop all your classes you will be charged a $500 fee.  ""

For context, I’m a freshman cognitive science student. When applying to schools, my high school gave me a small scholarship for students who would study music. It was by default, since we had so few seniors in the once proud music program. Playing piano has been my passion for almost 12 years, and attending this school makes me feel like I’m spitting in my high school’s face by doing nothing with music. I was originally going to attend Vassar or Carleton since they have non-major music programs, but last minute I chose UCLA for the money. When I signed the contract, I looked up “non major music opportunities UCLA”, and found that all of the classes are restricted for music majors, and that there’s no music minors (unless you count music industry and musicology). You can’t even get lessons like at other schools. I wanted to join an ensemble next year, because it said something along the lines of “sometimes non-music majors may join”. After going to a couple concerts this year I found that these students were all either music majors or complete prodigies or both (one pianist I saw was like 14). 

So you’re probably wondering “why didn’t you apply as a music major?”. I was going to, but then my parents convinced me that I’d never get a job. There is some truth to that, since it is quite difficult to get a career in music. My question is what do I do now? I talked to some advisors, my parents, other student non-major musicians, and there was a consensus: focus on your major, basically put music in your rear view mirror. I am clinically depressed, and music is one of the only things that makes me happy. I want to be able to succeed after college, maybe go to grad school, but right now I’m just an emotional mess who just wants to get better at piano."
eore68,“USAC’s funds come from about $9 million in student fees” Seriously?

But I think the bigger story is that USAC collects $9 million in student fees at all! Who consented to this? I have zero interaction with USAC or any USAC sponsored programs. I go to class and study and that’s pretty much how I spend my time here as a CS major because there’s not much time for anything else. 

Tuition and fees are already high enough without needing to be higher to justify a multi million dollar USAC budget. Why should we be subjected to a stupid quarterly fee against our will?? We should be able to opt out!

What a joke this is. What does USAC even do that I should even care about as a student who’s already tens of thousands in debt except contribute to that debt???

I tried to search to see if any official in USAC ever tried to reach out to r/UCLA to help us understand what they do and [all I found was this insulting tome from a USAC officer berating 
everyone for calling out his precious org.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/8h1fk8/an_open_letter_to_rucla_and_anyone_who_has_been/)

Is this the best explanation I can get?? Many people I know have told me that they misspend finds on retreats and other useless garbage.

Well I was totally overthinking it, you guys were right: he didn’t really care or all that much. Nor did he tell anybody like I feared. 

I was planning on just pretending like it never happened but instead  followed the advice of all the helpful people who commented on my thread by talking to him about it. I felt I needed to bring up the elephant in the room and apologized for perhaps making him feel uncomfortable. 

He said no worries it’s not a big deal, everyone watches that stuff. And then I felt totally relieved. I asked if he told anyone, especially that girl I like, and he said no, that thought never even crossed his mind. He admits it was funny and unexpected but that was all he thought. 

Long story short we ended up talking about our respective taste in porn movies and it turns out we have similar tastes. So I hooked up my laptop and we watched the rest of the movie together. Surprisingly it didn’t feel weird at all. It’s not like we jacked it together or anything. We just watched. But after being reassured by this subreddit that porn watching isn’t anything weird and that you could even do it with a friend I didn’t felt weird about it at all.

Now we actually have like a code word for when one of us needs privacy in the room for whatever reason so that we can avoid similar incidents in the future. (the code word is Pegasus)

Seriously thank you guys. Without the reassurance I received from this thread I honestly would have never been able to bring it up with him. Things would have likely remained weird between us all year because I would be tentative to engage him, and maybe even withdraw from interacting due to my overthinking and anxiety from the situation. I’m so glad it didn’t happen that way.

This subreddit is honestly the best. I occasionally visit other UC subreddits and none even come close to r/UCLA. No other community is so supportive, understanding or caring. Thanks for the advice guys!

We created a software company called Rityush Technology.  It was formed 3 years ago to mentor and train women in the Software Quality Assurance area and prepare them for their first IT jobs. We successfully trained 18 full-time moms. Most of them are now successful QA professionals working in companies like Fox, Disney, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Move.com, etc.

We are  again starting a model of training women in QA Automation Technology. Any one from any educational background with no technical knowledge are also good candidate to my course.
This is targeted primarily for any women, who wants to start a new career in IT, which pays well and has future for growth.

What I need from the candidate joining the training program is the commitment to work hard for next 6 months for at least 6 hrs. M-F and follow the path which we will show for getting the first IT job.
Please spread the word among like-minded women who may be interested to have a career in IT. 

The first batch with 15 women has already started as of Jan 13th. There is still some time where anyone interested can join the program by early next week. The next training session is not planned yet, but its possible that it may get started in 1st week of April.
I am now doing this as a full-time job and 100% dedicated to this cause.

 I would need a nominal fee of $200/month to cover some of my operating cost.
 I also partnered with a testing serviced company to help secure projects and jobs.
All the girls are being trained on a live project. This will give all the trainees a real-life experience.
If you or anyone who wants more details, please have them contact Sandeep Kumar @805-341-4138 ASAP as the next batch may not start for next few months.
The course if expected to run for 5 months, 5 days a week from 9 AM to 1:30 PM PST every day.

PS: I am 20+ years of experience in QA
Thanks

2) If it is okay for me to apply, can any past applicants/recipients offer any advice for what the committee looks for in the writing? As in, should I write formally or according to my personality.

In the future, I hope to eventually gain enough experience to somehow share this information as a guest speaker at any of my local high schools as well. 

I ended with a 4.0 this last semester and am hoping to do the same for the rest, however based on the the sheer amount of science requirements, I will most likely be applying in my 3rd year as opposed to my 2nd, if I were applying to other programs. Would this effect my likelihood of being admitted?

Although my end goal to become an RN, being at UCLA nursing someday has always been incredibly important to me. Not only is the passing rate for the NCLEX 95%, but it is an all around amazing, diverse, and spirited school located in a city that provides outstanding opportunities for anyone of any background. However, after researching the program, I discovered that the acceptance rate is nearly 6%. I've been well aware that it is extremely difficult to be accepted, but I would like to know - from UCLA students, especially those in the nursing program - if I should continue with this pathway, or apply to more realistic programs in my area?

Here are my main source of info:

another thing is that the fucking TAs don’t show up to lecture, so when we show up to discussion, THEY LITERALLY HAVE NOTHING PREPARED. how am i supposed to adequately learn material when the instructors aren’t even on the same page. i was sitting in my section and we were reviewing a powerpoint and then midway through lecturing, the TA realizes that she’s on the lecture for week 5, so she just abruptly ends class bc “there’s no point anymore”.

and the cherry on top of this shit-cake is that the professor takes attendance on the shittiest app known to humankind: acadly. half the people have to stay after class because the app doesn’t mark them present during class. like seriously? obviously if it’s not working by week 3, stop being fucking lazy and just pass the damn attendance sheet around. damn.

1) Research heavily 2 or 3 smaller companies and show strong interest in them, putting on my best game face tomorrow.

2) The reason my resume is so bad is due to addiction/depression my first couple of years here. My last year, however, I've turned my academics around and haven't dropped below a B. I've scored A's in some courses important to my major as well! I can point to my most recent grades when people see my GPA, I hope.

You can remember them by their pretty white house on Gayley or by their 15+ sexual assualt allegations that they're accrued over the past 1.5 years. Anyways, I wanted to take the time to tell you why I love Phi Psi. I love Phi Psi because they're fucking geniuses. I mean seriously, these guys came up with a foolproof plan that allows them to be safe from any type of incrimination. They can essentially do whatever the fuck they want with little repercussions. Let me explain.

For anyone that doesn't know, the IFC, or inter-fraternity council, is the governing body of social fraternities at ucla. They oversee roughly 20 frats from ZBT to Sigma Chi to Triangle and they're supposed to make sure that frats are following the rules. So here's the fucked up part. Half of IFC is comprised of Phi Psi guys. What does this mean? Well, it means that whenever Phi Psi does something wrong like haze pledges or commit molestation/rape, the case goes to IFC. And the students of IFC vote on what disciplinary action to take. Of course, because half of IFC is Phi PSi, nothing really happens to Phi Psi. Last quarter, Phi Psi had 3 allegations in roughly the FIRST WEEK OF THE QUARTER. What happened? They went on social probation, meaning they couldn't throw parties or do any brotherhood events for the quarter. 

Big fucking deal. This shit has been going on for like 2 years now where frats like Phi Psi rape girls, go on probation, then continue to rape girls. It's time for people to know that IFC is corrupt and to realize that IF AN ORGANIZATION IS GOING TO OVERSEE A GROUP OF PEOPLE, SAID ORGANIZATION SHOULD NOT BE COMPRISED OF THE PEOPLE THEY ARE OVERSEEING.

So yeah that's why I think Phi Psi is genius and the best fraternity in the country."

I thought UCLA was supposed to teach you all how to think critically? First of all, the fact is there are a lot of bitter people who are vested in seeing the downfall of greek life because they didn't get a bid. In other words, their sick little twisted fantasy is to spread rumors and tarnish our reputation because they couldn't make the cut. It happens every year and this year is no different. Unsubstantiated rumors from alt accounts defaming our reputation and character doesn't surprise me at all.

Second, there could be legal ramifications to speaking on these things in such a thoughtless and carefree manner. I'd recommend to anyone on this sub to tread lightly. We do have a legal team that is not afraid to take action against defamation.

Third, about the whole IFC thing: there may be a number of brothers on the council, but rest assured that would not prevent anyone who was accused of such horrible things from facing justice. Law enforcement gets involved and investigates these claims. So to try to paint the IFC as having more power than the local authorities to sweep this under the rug is asinine.

Have there been some allegations against us? You bet. But please know that we've always taken the proper steps to ensure that anybody who was harmed could receive due process. In the meantime, we've demonstrated a history of expelling members who have had claims against them to be found true. There is zero tolerance for that kind of shit in our house. We don't want it here; we don't welcome it. Everyone needs to understand this.

It is our goal it ensure that guests at all house feel safe and respected at all times. The past few years we have instituted new regulations to ensure this. Many of these new rules have been the brainchild of fellow brothers who serve on the council: we're talking SELF-IMPOSED rules here. So, if anybody is interested in mitigating these problems, it is definitely us.

Any allegations that were proven to be true effects shock and outrage in each and every one of us. We have no problem cutting ties with those who victimize women. And we fully cooperate with any and all investigations. I've personally talked to several people at the national level to discuss ideas and strategies as how to end these types of incidents.

If you are found to be guilty, regardless of whether you're a brother or not, you will face justice. Both in and out of the house. There's no ifs, ands, or buts about that. We have never swept anything like that under the rug. 

I will say however, that you shouldn't all take very claim against us at face value. While I concede that there have horrible incidents that turned out to be true, some of them have in fact been fabricated or exaggerated as a method of saving face. I know it's unpopular to say this, but it's the truth. I will be totally transparent about what we've been accused of, but that goes BOTH way. The fact is that some of these claims have been made up; they're lies. 

Finally, I just want to remind everyone that as an organization has exited on this campus for 90 years.  We have made tremendous contributions to the school:

\&gt;  Phi Kappa Psi continue to set the standard of what it means to be Bruin. Over the past couple years, our chapter has won  Pi Beta Phi’s Arrow Spike Philanthropy twice, Delta Gamma’s Anchor Splash Relay, Alpha Delta Pi's Lion's Cup and made the championship game of Kappa Alpha Theta’s Shootout Philanthropy. One of our brothers is also the reigning 2018 Alpha Phi Sorority Mr. Greek Sweetheart. 

In addition, we have dozens of our brothers involved in community service projects on campus that serve the needs of the underprivileged and marginalized. This group of gentleman are exemplary of what it means to hold true bruin values. This smear campaign will not bring us down.

The moderator that was active at the time made a judgment call that because the accusations against a specific group in the post were difficult to verify, the post should be removed at least until we as moderators had a chance to discuss how this should be handled. 

Here is our consensus: it is of the utmost importance that sexual assault on campus is discussed and that the conversation is allowed to proceed. If even a single person is helped by talking about this issue, it is worth it. Which is why we are trying to provide this space for as open a discussion as possible. 

The one caveat that must be observed is that this isn't not the appropriate venue to make public accusations. Please please please, if you or someone you know is a victim of sexual assault please reach out to UCPD. Their phone number is (310) 825-1491 and they will hear you out and hopefully get the assholes responsible locked away. 

Due to reddit's rules against witchhunting, our hands are tied to a certain extent about these difficult to verify accusations. For instance, accusing a particular group of sexual assault will have to be removed, however sharing a reputable, investigated news story about the large number of alleged sexual assaults a certain frat has been accused of is acceptable. [For instance, here is a well written Daily Bruin article about Phi Kappa Psi ""allegations of sexual assault committed by one of the fraternity members"" and how ""The member accused of sexual assault has since been removed from the fraternity but still lives in the house"" as of April 25th, 2019.](https://dailybruin.com/2019/04/24/campaign-responding-to-fraternity-sexual-assault-allegations-urges-for-reform/) And here's[ another great Daily Bruin article about ""UCLA’s reluctant response to rise of reported sexual assaults""](https://dailybruin.com/2019/10/08/uclas-reluctant-response-to-rise-of-reported-sexual-assaults-requires-reform/) These are examples of articles that we can and are happy to allow on the sub.

I apologize about the delay on our response to the issue here. We take this topic very seriously and wanted to make sure we had a chance to discuss how best to handle things moving forward. Please use this thread as a place to discuss and share resources about we can effectively deal with the growing problem of sexual assault on campus. And as always, we welcome your feedback and are happy to dialogue with you all on how we as a subreddit should approach these difficult topics."

I've seen a # of posts worried about the corona virus, so I just want to make a list of things that can help avoid getting some germs and protect you perhaps:

\- Carry handsanitizer

\- Cover your mouth when you cough and sneeze by utilizing the elbow method or sneezing INTO the inside of your shirt/ sweater. 

\- Wash your hands every time you utilize the restroom. Also wash before eating or handling food. 

\*Best hand-washing method: Wet hands first with water. Place a few pumps of soap in the palm of   
your hand. Rub hands together thoroughly for 20 seconds (make sure soap is in between fingers,   
etc.). Wash hands with water for 15-20 seconds. Turn off faucet (if not a sensor-based faucet) by   
using your wrist- not your actual hand. If possible, wash 2x\*

\- When exiting the restroom, pull the door handle with paper towels and dispose of them right after.

\- If a door has a handle/ knob: pull such knob/handle with the sleeve of your sweater, not your hand. If the door requires you to push it open, don't open it with your hand- push the door with the side of your arm. 

\-If using the elevator: push buttons with the sleeve of your sweater/ long-sleeve. Avoid using hands/ fingers. If you touch button with hands/ fingers, wash your hands or use sanitizer.

\- Avoid touching your face, mouth, and eyes. 

\- If possible, wear a disposable mouth mask. 

\- If possible, use sanitizing wipes to sanitize your phone, bruincard, dorm door handle, laptop, etc. 

\- (If possible) If you have been out for a number of hours, do not re-wear any piece of clothing you are wearing. Place in hamper to wash. 

\- If feeling sick/ under the weather, please visit the ASHE center ASAP. Whether you have a cold, flu, or even allergies, it is important for you to be checked up. If you are super duper sick, please stay in- for the well-being of yourself and for others. 

Take care everyone!"

I partied a lot in high school and I really think I got it out of my system and I just really want something more meaningful but it feels like thats nearly impossible to find. It’s just soooo damn exhausting, you know?
I liked that in high school at the end of the day I could go home have complete silence and me time and just recharge, nowadays I really feel like I can’t catch a break from school or anything at all and I am literally d y i n g please send help"

They never contacted me in between visits, and just sprung it on me when I had to come in for followup.

I'm pretty pissed about this, as I had received confirmation from the website, the first nurse and the medical insurance statement that I didn't have to pay extra-I can't plan care when I might get sprung with a surprise statement like this. I never would have gone for the vaccine if it was $300 per shot, so now not only are they trying to charge me $300 for the first shot, but I also don't have the full series anyway-so $300 are wasted anyway!

If he's a scam and he keeps touching people without consent, why does UCLA let him stay on campus for literally decades? We might as well just give him an honorary degree at this point.

Also, why is he only active at UCLA? Why not USC where there are more rich people? Or some other place like Santa Monica College etc

Lastly, does he really believe that ""'Scuse me boss, can I askya question?"" and ""Ladies, caniaskya question please, question question question"" is truly the best marketing tactic to intrigue students to whatever he has to say?

I'm currently a third-year econ student looking to study abroad in Europe (thinking London) for Fall 2020. Just a couple of questions: 

1) For top tier colleges like UCL, Kings College, Imperial, how hard is it to get into these programs? Or is it almost guaranteed? I'm also planning to do it with friends from UCI so wanted to know if the application is more of a formality or not. 

2) Recommendations and experiences! Still deciding, so if anyone studied abroad in Europe regardless of country, I'd love to hear more about your school and the experience you had there"

I'm writing this post as the running club is inviting everyone to come out to our practices this quarter and next! 

We welcome everyone of various skill levels and offer a few distances each day for you to choose from. Distances range from anything around 3 miles to 7+ miles and we set out to our runs at 4:15pm each weekday. We meet at the top of drake stadium just a bit to the side of bruinwalk. Practice is optional and you can show up whenever you want to. We're a really laid back group of people but if you are looking to be competitive, we also provide opportunities to do track workouts that differ from our usual practice route.

Attending Practice is free but know that when you officially join by registering with club sports, you get access to our weekly club socials throughout the  quarter. Last quarter some of these socials included hiking at nearby routes, kayaking in Marina Del Rey, movies nights, and more. This week, we are having a scavenger hunt, and next week we are going hiking. We are one of the most affordable sports clubs on campus coming in at $45 for the  ENTIRE SCHOOL YEAR. There is a an additional one time $45ish club sports annual fee that applies to every club sport, but if you have already paid it  by joining a different club sport, you will not have to pay that fee again.

It's a new year and we know everyone has a lot of new years resolutions for themselves already, but  we hope that you'll consider joining us for some runs and then possibly as a registered club member for the rest of the year! feel free to DM or comment of this post for any question you may have.

Here is a link to our facebook group where we  post our weekly schedule and more! : [https://www.facebook.com/groups/34573802542/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/34573802542/)"

# Comments:

- It seems these notes difer from what was taught in my cs32 class by a bit.

- No notes on linked lists at the moment, since the 2014 notes noted Carey was sick and didn't lecture that day.

- Will be looking over this tomorrow when I'm more well rested

ey5dg6,Any Biostatistics graduate students/alumni? Looking for some insight on the graduate programs offered here at UCLA,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/ey5dg6/any_biostatistics_graduate_studentsalumni_looking/,presomethiing,1,2020-02-03 02:46:31,0,/r/ucla/comments/ey5dg6/any_biostatistics_graduate_studentsalumni_looking/,NaN,"I am an undergraduate transfer student here at UCLA. I’m majoring in molecular, cell, and developmental biology and minoring in public health, and I just found out about the Biostatistics graduate programs. I was going over the descriptions and it sounds like something I would be interested in pursuing (more specifically the MPH and the MS programs). I'm already planning on visiting the main administration office sometime this week to get more concise info about the programs and what to expect from them. I also plan on contacting the chair of admissions to corroborate if the classes that I took back at community college fulfill the course requirements needed to apply to the program, or if they'd require/prefer for me to retake them here at UCLA (I'd appreciate insight on this if you have or know someone currently in the programs with a community college background). 

I'd like to know I’m mainly writing this post to get some insight from graduate students that are currently in the programs, alumni, and other prospective undergraduate applicants just like me. However, I am just trying to get a comprehensive understanding of what I would be getting myself into and whether or not it is an appropriate path for me, so I would still greatly appreciate any advice/info that you think would be relevant for me regardless of your background or experience (If you are part of other graduate programs here at UCLA/at any other universities or even if you heard something from a friend that you deem would be helpful, please don't hesitate in sharing; literally any info would be valuable to me at this moment). 

I'd appreciate some insight from graduate students and alumni from the MS and MPH programs about the professional fields/jobs you aspire to pursue or currently find yourself in after completing the program (I know a can find about this information online, but I’m more interested in seeing if there are more common career choices than others). More specifically though, I'd like to know what is it like to be a student in these programs here at UCLA: what do you think about the program now that you are/were part of it? what is the coursework like? do you enjoy it or is there anything you could do without?  does the program provide the emphasis you were expecting? does it fulfill other expectations you might have had prior to joining? are you content with the academic/professional resources available to you? How is your relationship/interactions with faculty/advisors and other peers in the program? As a current student or alumni, is there anything good or bad you would highlight about your academic experience? Is there anything you wish you would have done differently or any info you wish you would have known prior to being part of the program? 

I would also like to know what does the profile of a competitive applicant look like for these programs (I know this might be considered sensitive info for some, and I understand if you may not want to share, but like I said, any info would help). What was your background/profile as an applicant in terms of your major and extracurriculars? Is there anything about it that you think made you stand out/more competitive among other applicants? Did you take any classes outside of your major coursework that you think made you a better-rounded applicant? Or as graduate student/alumni, were there any courses/experience you wish you would have had as an undergraduate to better prepare you for what's expected in the program? If you attended UCLA as an undergrad, are there any specific courses/extracurriculars you recommend for me, a life science major, that would make me a well-rounded applicant/graduate student?

I am aware that the answers these questions will be very relative from person to person, but thank you so much in advance for your valuable advice and insight. I know it's a very lengthy post , and of course I don't expect all of these to be answered, but i’ll be more than content if at least some these are. I want to be sure about what I would be getting myself into thus I will continue to do my diligent research as well as reaching out to graduate students here on campus.

pd: sorry for the lengthy post :( also sorry if some of the questions are not very specific. This is my reddit post, so I guess i’ll learn to make better ones with time."

Since the email wasn’t sent to all Bruins as it should be, here’s a copy:

“Dear campus community,

We write to inform you that on the morning of Monday, February 10th, 2020, the Westboro Baptist Church (WBC) will be hosting an action on the public property surrounding Murphy Hall in opposition to UCLA’s LGBTQIA+ inclusive policies. The WBC is a nationally recognized hate organization by the Southern Poverty Law Center whose work “specializes in anti-gay vitriol.”

This event is independently organized by the WBC and taking place on public property. The WBC as an organization and the views it espouses are not representative of UCLA’s community nor our True Bruin Values.

In order to neither embolden nor incite their hateful speech, we encourage all UCLA students and community members to not engage with this organization. Instead, we invite you to join us in community to share space in the days preceding and directly after the event.

Therefore, the Office of the Dean of Students, the LGBT Campus Resource Center, and our colleagues will offer the following spaces for UCLA community members to seek support, community, and resources:

Pre-Event Community Space
Wednesday Feb 5, 5-6pm, Student Activities Center Conference Rooms 1 &amp; 2
This space is intended to provide information and support to UCLA community members in processing the impact of the event and understanding their first amendment rights and University restrictions around time, place, and manner. Staff from the Office of the Dean of Students, Counseling and Psychological Services, Staff and Faculty Counseling Center, SOLE, and 580 Café/Wesley Foundation serving UCLA will be present. This is open to UCLA students, staff, and faculty with light refreshments.

Post-Event Community Space
Monday Feb 10, 1pm-3pm, LGBT CRC (Student Activities Center, Suite B36)
This space is intended for UCLA community members to process through the impact of the event in community.

CAPS Drop-In Hours for UCLA Students at the LGBT CRC
Mondays, 1-3pm &amp; Thursdays, 1-3pm, LGBT CRC (Student Activities Center, Suite B36)
The LGBT CRC’s Counselors in Residence are available for individual drop-in consultation several days a week for current UCLA students.

Additional Resources:
LGBT Campus Resource Center https://www.lgbt.ucla.edu/
Counseling and Psychological Services https://www.counseling.ucla.edu/
The RISE Center https://risecenter.ucla.edu/

If you have any questions or need any additional support, please reach out to the LGBT CRC Staff.”

It is absolutely terrifying to read this as a trans queer person. I encourage any other queer Bruins to attend these community events or seek help if you need it. Although they aren’t perfect, UCLA stands with us and it’s encouraging enough that the WBC sees us as a threat. Stay safe, friends, and try to avoid Murphy Hall the morning of. My strength is with you. Allies: check in with your LGBTQ+ friends this week, offer support, give them your love."

hey guys. with everyone on the hunt for apartments recently, there are still predatory assholes that preying on us that are trying to find a place to live. this is an example of ""william"" trying to scam my girlfriend and i. while i'm aware of these tactics, someone who is just desperate enough might not and get themselves put into an awful situation. 

my girlfriend and i are looking for places to live next year and while searching for listings on craigslist (a reach), we found a place at Club Cali for $2,000. this being out, but manageable in our budget, i emailed him and sent him our information. club cali offers many amenities that i'm aware of and i know the location well. the price and everything that came with it was very appealing to its clientele.

he emailed us back and for those who can't see the link, this is what it read:  


&gt;Hello  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks for your followup email, your details are very much appreciated and accepted by the landlord, we have this property still occupied until February 27th and due to the recent rush and frequent viewing the current occupant requested for a total privacy which the landlord granted.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;You can only at this moment have the property reserved for you with the down payment of the first month rent and refundable security deposit prior to your viewing and moving date, you will be required to signed our lease agreement form  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Note: our refund policy state that if for any reason you choose not to proceed with the lease after viewing right there on the spot the landlord who will be available on the 27th will be refunding your money in full immediately.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Let me know if your which to proceed with the lease contract review and reservation details for booking.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Very respectful  
&gt;  
&gt;William

if you can't tell how shady and predatory this email is upon reading it, i will break it down for you and provide you with some tips of weeding out these assholes.   


1. **you should be able to tour the apartment.** no excuses. if you want to live in a certain unit, you get to see it before you live in it. i know with club cali many of the layouts are similar and so there are other renters that provide tours, but this applies to any place you go. if you can't see it, why the hell would you pay for it?
2. **pay now and ask questions later.** you should have time to think about the place you want to live in and not just decide right there on the spot. they want you to rush and make irrational decisions based on how desperate they think you are. this relates to transparency. you want to know what you're getting into.
3. **sketchy promises.** how do you know that you'll get your money back after sending it to them? you don't. they play into your housing insecurities and mention you will have a property ""reserved"" for you should you need it. the refund ""policy"" that they have listed also seems iffy and just highly unlikely to happen.
4. **too good to be true.** some places are literally too good to be true, unless you have big $ and live on midvale, it's unlikely that you will get all these nice amenities and furnishings included in your rent. not impossible, just unlikely.
5. **spelling errors.** it's really common amongst scams in general to have spelling errors and grammar mistakes in their listings. you may not catch them at first glance. when you do catch them and reread the post as a whole, it just sounds weird, wrong and is most likely an attempt of scamming you. some sentences just don't make sense.
6. **absence.** for some reason, X cannot be there to show you \[interest\] at the time, so XYZ. for a transaction to even occur, both parties must be present. if they have some excuse as to why they can't meet you/show you X, do not pay them any money beforehand.

while these may be obvious, some of us are in shitty situations (sawtelle fires) that are in dire need of a place to stay, allowing us to be more susceptible to scams. these are just a few things to look out for, but there are others. 

be cautious and stay safe when looking for a place to live."

The Department of Psychological Science at the University of California, Irvine is currently accepting applications to our post-baccalaureate program in psychological science (the deadline to apply for Fall 2020 is May 22nd). 

**Program** **Overview:**  UCI’s Post-Baccalaureate Program in Psychological Science is a certificate program that combines psychology coursework with research and/or internship experience. It is designed for people who have a bachelor’s degree (in any discipline); who are interested in a psychology-related graduate program, career development, or career change; and who could benefit from additional coursework, research and/or real-life work experience in psychology. Those interested in doctoral-level or master’s degree programs in a range of areas of psychology (including clinical/counseling psychology, social/personality psychology, developmental psychology, health psychology, psychology &amp; the law, and school psychology) or health (e.g., public health, medical school) can strengthen their graduate school applications by completing our program, which offers an individualized course of study based on each person’s qualifications and goals.  Students who have completed our program have been accepted to a wide variety of graduate programs, including Ph.D. programs at UC Berkeley, Cornell University, and UC Irvine; Psy.D. programs at Cal Lutheran, University of Indianapolis, and Yeshiva University, and Master's programs at NYU, Columbia, and UCLA.

**Program** **Description:**  The program consists of eight courses, which may include lower- and upper-division lectures, small seminars (including advanced statistics and research methods), hands-on research lab courses, and/or hands-on internship courses.  The program can be completed at the student’s own pace, in as little as 9 months or in as many as 24 months, depending upon one’s schedule and preferences.  A faculty advisor will work closely with students to help plan courses and provide guidance on obtaining letters of recommendation, choosing graduate programs, writing personal statements, and applying for jobs.  In addition, students will have the opportunity to attend our weekly departmental colloquia and other special events and to interact with our community of faculty, researchers, and graduate students.  For more information, please visit: [https://ps.soceco.uci.edu/post-bacc-page/post-baccalaureate-program-psychological-science](https://ps.soceco.uci.edu/post-bacc-page/post-baccalaureate-program-psychological-science)

**Information** **Session:**  An information session will be held on Friday, February 21st at 11am in Social Ecology I (SE-I) Room 112 on the UC Irvine campus ([http://uci.edu/visit/maps.php](http://uci.edu/visit/maps.php)).  All are welcome!"

 I chose UCSB for the beach, social scene, and a more relaxed environment.

Words about ""The Enrollment"" were wafted through the community like a dreaded inevitable stench. As the day passed by, I grew nervous. I knew I wasn’t the only one who felt this way, especially after the last quarter. Many of us remember the blood left in Drake Arena and those who were lost in the battle for STATS 10. As I got ready for bed that night I took care in my nightly routine. I wasn’t sure if it’d be the last time I’d fall asleep. 

The next morning I had to be confident as I got prepared for battle. The sword I often admired above our family mantlepiece would finally be put to use today. As I gently slid the blade into my belted holster I imagined my father and grandfather doing the same. I knew they’d been in my position. Images of them fighting for The Enrollment flashed in my mind as I walked out my front door and began my journey to the arena.

As I made my way through the forest, the trees seemed to encroach upon me. I felt watched and judged. The thick Bruin Forest was often thought of as a safe space, but right now I only felt in danger. Eventually, the density of the trees lessened and I walked out into the large sloping clearing: Drake Arena. I had been walking perpendicular to the same slope in the forest most of the way there and now my ankles felt sore. I clenched my teeth and mustered the strength that I knew I would need today. I remembered the phrase my mother would always tell me, “Only Berkeley bears cry.”

I trudged forward, blocking out the pain from my ankle. 

As I entered the clearing, I joined a ring of other students already there. Most of them were armed with their own swords. Although the image should’ve invoked fear within me, I simply chuckled to myself. At this moment I felt as if our school was both the most connected and yet the most divided at the same time. The irony had humored me.

The large ring of hundreds of enrollees and was now being joined from the inside by a ring of Division 1’s. These large mindless beings had always given me the creeps. The ring of blue backpacks created as these beasts joined hands was intimidating and also seemingly inanimate. When their arms moved, that was when the battle began. 

The large hands dropping in unison across the formation seemed slow. My mind raced and yet was blank. Suddenly everything became crystal clear and I began to act on impulse. I entered the battle and somehow felt as if I was operating on instinct. I had always been a sensitive person but here I was someone else. I felt like an animal. I saw my hands do things I couldn’t have fathomed. Blood splattered on my face as I sliced and cut. I felt refreshed seeing the guts of my potential classmates fall on the long grass. When the alarm sounded it was all over. I stood, breathing hard and looked out among the clearing. A few others stood standing like me. These were my classmates.  I hung my head in exhaustion. Somehow the juxtaposition of human innards and the fresh soil seemed natural. I heard soft footsteps coming my way yet I didn’t bother to move. Then there was a clipboard with paper on it in front of me. “STATS 10 - Introduction to Statistical Reasoning” it read at the top.  Of course, The Enrollment Sheet, I had only heard stories about it. The TA handed me the pen and I signed it without moving my gaze from the guts I had my eyes on before. I took one last deep breath before shifting my vision. My sinuses felt clear, I felt cleansed. 

I walked back from the clearing into the forest and made my way home."

My question is, if we drive out to Pasadena on a Sunday, with no events going on - is there an easy way to get a good photo of the front of the stadium that's not just zooming by from the car window?

I have no idea what to do with my life. I graduated last year from south campus and got a job so at least there's that but it's been over half a year since graduation and I am still no where near closer to figuring out what I want to do, nor do I think I ever will really. I think getting stuck on the idea that I have to have one concrete ""goal"" isn't helpful at this point and it's more important to make steps in directions that I want to take (do things I want to try, explore fields even if I don't know where it will lead) but I feel like I'm never really going to be interested in anything or want to do anything. Even when I have been taking the time to explore things, it just feels pointless, like it all just leads to a short dead end. I feel like I could do any job and just fall into a monotonous routine of it and just not care (which is what I feel like I'm already doing and I'm not even a year into my job). 

At least while in undergrad, even if I didn't have a definitive goal in mind, I was confident that as long as I was taking what I believed were the right steps, I would be on the right trajectory towards something good-which is what led me to my job which I was happy to get and it's a good job, but I definitely can't see myself staying here but I would have no idea what else to do. I feel like I'm going to float around for all my life and have no idea of what to actually do. My parents keep on pushing me to just go to grad school but there's no point if I have no idea what I want to do and to shove myself into something only to waste tens of thousands of dollars and time and effort (I've also been through the premed/prehealth tracks and they're definitely not for me).

Even when I did try the things I thought I loved to do, I feel like I've become indifferent to them now too-so if I became indifferent to what I thought I really liked, then what will I ever really do? I fear that I'm going to just float around with no goals and ambition for the rest of my 20s and end up in my 30s regretting my life choices. I lost my love for my old hobbies and passions over the course of undergrad  (while telling myself I had to focus on my academics, yay ucla and quarter system) and now that I've graduated and working I'm really feeling the impact of having nothing I really care about doing and it's a really sad feeling. Anything that I think I'd want to do doesn't pay enough to cover the bills or needs a graduate degree but how can I even figure out if I want to go to grad school if I can't even try out the job it'd be for??

I think all of this is hitting me worse knowing that it's now been over half a year since graduating and time went by so quickly, and the thought that the next (now 4) months will go by in a flash as well and it'll have been a year since graduation and I will still be in the exact same spot as a year ago with no idea of what I'm doing or what to do with my life is terrifying and awful (also this isn't to say that post grad life has been absolutely awful for all you undergrads out there-but things can definitely be tough in ways different than undergrad). 

If there are any other post-grads out there also feeling lost, hopefully this at least lets you know that you're not alone. If there's any alumni out there who have been in this situation, any advice/insight you can offer would be really appreciated and taken to heart. 

I just want to scream off a cliff that I have no idea what I'm doing with my life but alas I wake up every morning eat my burnt toast and go to work just like every other day :')"

i’m currently attending a california community college and have secured a cumulative gpa of 4.0 (yay!!). i’m seeking involvement in several campus programs, including Honors/TAP (which raises acceptance rate to 75% as described)... however, there is one little issue that is bothering me.

i took a summer course in 2017 at a community college within a district i no longer reside. it was a speech 101 class that i performed fairly well in, until the day of the final... i received a B in the class. 

UCLA requires total honesty in transcript admission of ALL previously attended post-secondary institutions. 

in time for the fall 2020 application, i’m estimating to garner a cumulative 4.0 gpa because of the type of courses i’m taking (i’m an extensive planner). however, with this added curse of a B, the number goes down to 3.91, which absolutely rattles my perfectionist mind.

please. help. i don’t know if i should go through with omitting this record, as i never applied to any financial aid or scholarship in the previous institution, and i haven’t transferred the 3 credits to the CC i’m attending now.

thank u love u"

I’m a first year, and things have been going really well so far academically, but recently not so much financially. My parents are divorcing and suddenly I need to rely on my mom’s (low) income to pay for next quarter’s tuition and housing, which isn’t possible for us anymore. Almost all of these costs would be taken out as loans under her name (because of the federal borrowing cap on me as a student), but I absolutely cannot in good conscience put anyone other than myself into that much debt for my own sake.  

For the past few weeks I’ve kind of been incapacitated with anxiety about this- can’t sleep, can’t eat, can’t focus on schoolwork. Everything about being at this school reminds me of the immense financial burden that I’ll be worsening if I enroll again next quarter and subsequent years. Right now my mental state is a mess, my mom is out of a permanent place to stay, and I’m on the cusp of enrolling for another 10k+ in loans. So I’ve definitively decided to pause enrollment at UCLA, get a job, help pay for a place to stay, and take much cheaper cc classes. Maybe one day I’ll be back, maybe not. 

I’m primarily concerned about cancelling my housing contract for spring quarter— What makes for a strong financial appeal for termination? Is there a way to get out without having to pay the quarter’s housing?

Sorry if this is all over the place, I’m kinda barfing my thoughts out rn, any help appreciated :((("

Our professor finally couldn't take it anymore and stood up, started saying things like ""respect the class, no trolling"", and even went as far as to ""detain"" those who say ""bless you"" again. Not raging or anything, but definitely startled a bunch of us who were just quietly writing stuff down.

I'm gonna try to switch into the School of Engineering next year from LS. Thing is, I'm not sure if it's worth it to take summer session classes so I could switch in earlier. If I take the classes, I can apply Fall Quarter next year. If I don't, I have to wait until Spring Quarter next year.

The classes I'm thinking of doing over the summer are Math 32A, Chem 14B, and Physics 1A. I have to do a full courseload, so at least twelve units. One science and one math (Math and Physics). 

*I know the engineering students take the 20 series, but I talked to a counselor about starting Chem, and since it's not offered next quarter, they suggested I start the 14 series so I can finish Chem on time.*

My main concerns is the workload. I need a high GPA in these classes to meet the requirements to apply to transfer, so was wondering it it was worth it to take the summer classes or if I should just wait it out.

It was a normal Tuesday afternoon, in which I had decided it would be a good day to transport my laundry to the first floor of Hedrick Summit, so that I may wash it. I gathered my laundry bag and my detergent and traversed to the laundry room. Once there, I discovered two available washers adjacent to each other. A perfect opportunity. I tossed in my laundry, separating my light clothes and towels from my dark clothes. Satisfied with the load being just barely full for my dark clothes, I added detergent to both sets and started up the machines. Relief. I set a timer and decided that I would partake in math homework while I waited. What proceeded this was undeniable. unprecedented evil.

I returned to the laundry room. On time, I was ready to begin drying my clothes, then tragedy struck. I opened the circular door of the first machine and unloaded my dark clothes, however as I grabbed hold of the second machine's door handle, doubt filled my mind. I tugged at the door, but it would not open. ""Maybe it wasn't actually finished washing."" I thought to myself as I peered into the abyss that was the washing machine. The was no movement in that void, the screen above the door flashed, ""$1.50"" as if taunting me. I pulled again. It was no use. My clothes and towels had been locked away from me, captured in the jaws of this mechanical beast. Losing hope, I decided to call for reinforcements. The front desk. Surely they would handle this demon swiftly, they are seasoned veterans of housing. I was terribly mistaken. I watched, helplessly as they pulled and pulled against the might of the machine. The light of hope grew dimmer with each pull as I watched my laundry fading from my grasp. After much struggle, the front desk had given up. My reinforcements defeated in the same manner as I. 

Two days have since passed since that fateful encounter. I have been told that professionals have been summoned to handle this calamity. UCLA staff have exhausted all the tools at their disposal by this point. A maintenance worker, someone even more skilled than those at the front desk at handling situations such as these could do nothing when faced with this monster. With this failure, there is but one option. The professionals. The ones summoned are none other than the very creators of this demon. If anyone can defeat it, it would be them. Unfortunately they require preparation before arriving on the scene, thus I must be patient. Soon the washing machine company will appear to quell this machine's reign of terror. At least that is what I have to believe. Until that day comes, I glance into the laundry room on my way out, the root of my despair. I look towards the machine and see a pitiful paper placed on it. Out of order. Indeed this washing machine is out of order, it only knows chaos as my laundry sits in its chamber, rotting away, sullied by its waters, the waters of captivity. Day by day I wait for when I can finally be reunited with my laundry, that which I hold so dear."

I am currently at a CC as a biology major planning on transferring next spring. I have been wanting to go to UCLA since high school but due to financial reasons (and not getting in), I opted for CC. Right now I have a 3.8 GPA (would've been higher if I wouldn't have taken that dual enrollment Chem class over the summer of my high school sophomore year) and I feel great about my academics. I am also in many extracurriculars and have done a lot of volunteer/internship/jobs relating to my area of study. I have taken a couple tours of UCLA, researched the hell out of it, and I loved it. I joined this subreddit to get a feel of what campus life is like at UCLA and my doubts started flooding in. Hearing horror stories from friends that have transferred to UCLA and posts to this subreddit I am fearful that it might be too much for me in regards to my studies. I wanted to ask those who understand what I am going through what they think now that they are have experienced campus life at UCLA. Would you have done something differently?

The day that all of my sorrows would finally disappear. However, I was only met with disappointment.

I passed the hours by sitting in lecture, awaiting for when I could return to see my precious laundry back in my arms. When I had finally returned to my residence, I was left distraught. The demon still lingered. It’s influence loomed over me like storm clouds. This nightmare of a washing machine would give up so easily.

I waited longer in my room, doing meaningless work, everything had become devoid of meaning since the incident. Seconds turned to minutes turned to hours. I wanted to scout the laundry room one last time before I gave in, however all I had to do was get near to feel the dark aura permeating from that room. It lingered. I cut my losses and made my way once again to the front desk, my only bastion of hope. Once I arrived, it was as if I was greeted by doomsayers. They did not provide hope, only a dreary reality. Today was the last day before the creators of the machine would vanish from existence for the week’s end. I would be left alone, abandoned. How could I possibly last for three whole days with no power at my disposal to combat the washing machine? I hold little influence over my own destiny in this affair. This frightens me. It shakes my very core. Threatens my being. How I wish I could be near the final correspondence regarding the situation. It seems as if this turmoil may never end. Be wary friends. Your humble words and offerings have aided me in surviving this strife. I would not desire the same fate to fall upon one of you. Remain vigilant."

Orientation, the vibe of the program, and THE COST (I mean the uniform, if you don’t own tan pants and white shoes, can easily total $60+) made me sooo bitter, and I feel like care extenders isn’t worth the amount of stress it would be introducing into my life. In addition to my non-healthcare job and other hospital volunteering, I feel a little stretched thin. Do you think care extenders is worth sticking around for?

Also if I have 2 bad grades (D / C) will those ruin my chances of getting into a education grad school/credentialing program? Thank you in advance for reading this and helping me

f4ecgg,MASSIVE CAMPUS WIDE PROBLEM,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/f4ecgg/massive_campus_wide_problem/,hs4353,1,2020-02-15 11:31:43,20,/r/ucla/comments/f4ecgg/massive_campus_wide_problem/,NaN,"There is a huge problem on this campus. That’s right, on this very campus, the campus of the number one public university on the United States of America, many, a huge proportion, possibly most, of the male students do not know how to use a toilet. The number of times that I have walked into a toilet stall to be greeted by what can only be described as a shitshow is, as they say too damn high. People giving the poor toilet seat golden showers, leaving shit stained TP in the stall, all of it needs to stop. I understand that the transition to sanity and civility might be difficult and confusing, maybe even scary for some of you gentlemen. It is for those reasons that I have taken the liberty of creating a helpful guide to the etiquette of excretion. 

1) When it comes time to syphon the python, you have to AVOID the toilet seat. Try using the urinal instead. Or, if you have penis envy (completely understandable) you may enter a stall, lift the toilet seat up (this vital step is one that many guys seem to forget) and only when the toilet seat is in its fully open position, may you proceed to shake hands with the firehose.
Now, some of you have very poor aim. Don’t deny it, I’ve seen your human lemonade decorating many a restroom floor.  It’s nothing no be ashamed of and, importantly, it does not necessarily mean that you have a small penis (it’s only an indicator that you might). If this is you, please take a seat on the aforementioned toilet seat, make yourself comfortable, and then you may drain the main vein. 

2) Please flush after completion. It’s not hard. Really, it’s not. You see that silver lever near the top of the toilet? Simply press it down and the fruits of your labor will go down the drain, just like your midterm grades. Believe me, everyone who has to flush the toilet on behalf of the person who used it before them wishes death not only on that person, but their entire family, their pets, anyone they remotely care about and even their phone battery. Yes, they hate you that much. 

3)Speaking of flushing, any toilet paper that you use goes INSIDE the toilet. INSIDE means INSIDE, not around, on or near. INSIDE. If you used a toilet seat cover, that goes in there as well. Why, you may ask? Because you are going to flush all of that stuff alongside your excrement so no one else has to deal with your human waste.

Appendix
I have decided to add this section because I feel it is necessary to include information relating to the use of the entire restroom,not exclusively related to using the toilet.
I can’t begin to count how many times I have seen unhygienic degenerates walk out of the restroom after clearly taking the mother of all shits without washing there hands, the same hands that were just, seconds ago, in between their hairy asscheeks wiping off thick, warm gooey shit residue. There is no excuse. Wash your fricken hands with warm water AND soap. Yes, even if you just went ‘number one’ wash them.

So now, hopefully, you feel more prepared for next time your Russian alarm clock goes off. Really, it’s basic human decency after all.

As a bonus piece of information, a few restrooms have shiny reflective floors (eg the ones downstairs in Powell) so if you decide to partake in any ‘extracurricular activities’ an the eyes of an innocent passerby may be assaulted by a glimpse of you, dickinhand."

Throughout this process I thought that an econ minor would really be perfect to give just enough econ knowledge while also allowing for me to take more mathematical finance courses as electives rather than just standard macro/micro theory.  I feel that it's kind of exclusive of the econ department not to have a minor, especially considering that that almost every one of the popular majors at UCLA has a minor.

Also, I've found it nearly impossible to try to fit an econ course into my schedule these past two quarters and won't be able to take econ 1 in spring because of a time conflict with my cluster.  Certainly the econ dept knows that south campus people have classes MWF and discussions TR, yet that's exactly when they schedule their classes.

* I respect your space and privacy entirely! Feel free to go out and do your own thing or hang out with me in the room whenever!
* I appreciate cleanliness and staying organized. I never make or leave a mess! I like keeping the room clean and decorated.
* We don't smoke or do drugs.
* I study mainly in the room and spend my time outside of class doing homework or working my part-time job remotely from the room. 
* We typically listen to music through our speakers to have ambient sound in the room. I personally like Jon Bellion, Blackbear, BROCKHAMPTON, etc. If this bothers you, we have headphones, but the music is just a vibe. We don't keep it very loud!
* I go to sleep around 11pm whereas my friend stays up late until around 1 or 2am studying quietly and makes no noise.
* We occasionally have friends over and just hang out and talk or play the Wii. We'll always ask beforehand and never let anyone stay if you're trying to work or don't want the company!
* You don't need to be an engineering major to room with us! 
* Overall, we're very laid back people just living the engineering grind here at UCLA. Feel free to message me if you have questions and we can talk more!"

Hello Bruins,

I was just wondering if there were any successful computer science transfers that had any courses left to do in the spring. I'm finishing the last two of my major courses I have left in the spring semester but will have all the recommended courses done as well. 2019 stats shows that the 75 percentile of admits were a 4.0 and the 25 percentile was a 3.94.

We are so excited to hear this presentation, given in anticipation of the Sustaining Visions and Legacies Conference in March. Hope you will join us on **Friday at 12:15 pm **

The Information Studies Lab is within the Education &amp; Information Studies Building next door to Young Research Library and behind Northern Lights Coffee Shop. All of you are welcome to join us."

Nothingness had pervaded the days previous. It was as if I had been wandering the Sahara, in search of an oasis, but had been coming up empty. I thirsted for some form of progress, longed for anything that would aid me in finally seeing my laundry again. But there was nothing for me in the vast desert that was UCLA housing on a weekend. Every day I would stop by the laundry room, seeing if anything had changed, when I knew deep down that it would remain as it was. I began to question if it would ever waver, ever morph into the sight that I had been waiting for this past week. Morale was low, time was fading for project 3, I had to set my mind upon different tasks. There was nothing left for me to do for my laundry, I was powerless and it would have to endure the torment of the washing machine on its own. I am sure it felt the same way I did. Forlorn. I reluctantly placed all my attention on Socrates Nguyen and delved into a virtual world of my own creation, one where I could help. But these feelings of loss still hung over me. Nothingness.

Today, the sun rose on a new horizon. I did not yet know it, but today would be the day that real change was made in the world. I awoke this morning just like any morning. I took half an hour to get out of bed, brushed my teeth, put on clothes, and made my way to my 9 am lecture. I feverishly continued coding through the lecture, and the next, and the next. I could not focus on the lectures because much like my laundry, the pixelated Socrates Nguyen needed my help. I advanced slowly, with my only reprieve being occasional chats with a friend adjacent to me. Once my lectures concluded, it was finally time to perform my daily scouting of the laundry room. I made my way back to the Hill, to Hedrick Summit and stopped by the laundry room. I gave a peek in, saw that the washing machine was open, and continued walking. Wait. Had my eyes deceived me? Had I been blinded by the monotony and despair of never seeing any progress? Nay, salvation had arrived. 

The time had come. I had witnessed a miracle. I had found my oasis. I peered into the maw of the defeated demon and saw my precious laundry. Reunited at last. Overjoyed, I couldn't help but hug it after all of the pain both it and I underwent, but I quickly felt that something had been off. Of course, after spending an entire week in the belly of the beast, it could not help but be tainted by its pungent odor. I scurried up to my dorm room to retrieve a bag to carry the laundry in. I was unable to carry it in my arms, for I feared that I too would become tainted by the scent. Returning to my treasured belongings, I packed them away in the bag, and took them away from the wretched washing machine that had tormented them for an entire week. Unfortunately, there was a terrifying reality that I had to face. I did not have the power to revert the lasting effects caused by the washing machine. There was only one being with that power. A washing machine. Fearful, hopeful, steadfast, I said a goodbye to my laundry once again. This was not the type of farewell that was permanent, I had faith that I would see my laundry once again. It felt wrong and cruel to toss my laundry right back into the flames from which it had just escaped, but this was a necessary sacrifice. Reluctantly, I passed my precious cargo into another washing machine and shut the door. One last dance with the devil."

I found her on this subreddit, so I thought I’d post this to see if anyone would be interested.

Disclaimer: Your mileage may vary.

Source: Took Hlushchanka in Spring 19 and got a B+, even though in the beginning I was as lost as much as most, if not all, of the people who are taking it now feel.

* Go to office hours. I can't emphasize this enough. If you can't go to his office hours, go to your TA's. If you can't, go to another TA's. If you can't make any of these, go to the Student Math Center. Personally, I did all of these I could from Week 3 on. Ask about questions from the HW, any practice tests you've taken, problems from the textbook, or about anything from the lecture.
* Read the textbook before/after lecture. The textbook provides good examples and is another source of clarification. Since Hlushchanka does go fast during lecture, reading it before will help you keep up.
* Focus on concepts rather than computations. While there are a lot of computations regarding change of bases and stuff, the calculations all boil down to just solving systems of equations and matrix multiplication. There's no use continuing to practice these if you don't know where to apply them and what matrices to use. When reviewing for the midterms and finals, I did more conceptual problems rather than computations. Always ask ""why do we do this?"" or ""how does this work?""
* Review the fundamentals. Everything in this class is connected somehow, so if you have a gap in your understanding somewhere, it gets very difficult to do things later, unless you are a god at memorizing the ways to solve every problem of every type.
* Ask questions during lecture. I know he comes off rude, but in my experience asking questions, Hlushchanka was always really nice and gave good explanations on things I didn't know. On the other end of this, please don't ask right now stuff like ""what is the image of a matrix?"" You should've asked that a while ago to be honest. If you ask thoughtful questions or need clarification (for something he said recently), there is no reason to be afraid.
* Watch the Linear Algebra series by 3blue1brown on YouTube. It helps a lot for understanding concepts.

Also, side note, I know Hlushchanka has sort of a bad rep among everyone and I won't deny that his class is difficult, but reflecting after taking his class, I think he is a really good teacher (especially if you are a math major) and he is definitely more fair than most. The fact that he goes super fast in the beginning is to make a lot of time to explain stuff like eigenvalues and eigenvectors. He also spends a good amount of time reviewing at the end of the term (from what he did during my time taking him). His pace is similar to the linear algebra upper division class I am taking now (which is basically teaching everything from 33a but with proofs).

I think a lot of the hate on him is the relative difficulty of the material of 33A and how different it is from every math class. It's very conceptual rather than calculations, e.g. the 32 series and 33b, so it can feel frustrating. Personally, I think the difficulty of math classes here goes 33A &gt; 32A &gt; 32B &gt; 33B rather than the commonly accepted 32B &gt; 33A &gt; 33B &gt; 32A.

Anyways, good luck with the class! I actually really enjoyed it (I distinctly remember enjoying the tests, believe it or not). If you have any questions, PM me or leave a comment and I'll try to respond to everyone."

Our room selection time is at 8:45 AM so we can get anywhere we want on the hill. We're pretty set on a Deluxe Triple on the 9th floor of Sproul Landing, but wouldn't be entirely opposed to something cheaper.

So I'm OOS graduating as a junior (please don't ask why--it's for academic reasons and because I don't love my high school) and I have 6 APs total. My HS calculates my weighted GPA as like a 4.5 (~4.4 when I submitted my application though. But my UC weighted GPA is like 4.13 because they're only using my 10th grade GPA for that and sophomores at my HS can basically only take 2 AP classes-- and one of them is art (and none of my honors classes are weighted because I'm OOS). So they're calculating my GPA w/ just 10th grade, and I only took 1 AP then. 

My SAT is between 1500 and 1530. I had good (but probably not great) PIQs and okay ECs. BTW my UC UW is 4.0.

I have loved UCLA since middle school. I want to go there so badly. It's probably dumb to worry about it now because decisions come out in a month but does anyone think I could get in? Perhaps a reassuring anecdote about a kid with similar stats? 

Any input is welcome. 

Thank you!"

After looking over at my prospective schedule and being confident in my abilities to teach the class(es) that I may be PLF'ing, I think I can handle it with my own personal course load for the next few quarters, especially in the summer. 

One thing to note is that I also do have a job already and it's extremely flexible. The plan is to work this current job that I have and PLF in the evenings or afternoons. Yes, I could technically quit my current job but I enjoy it and it'll prep me for my future after undergrad. With PLF'ing, I really want to explore teaching more and learning more about the different types of students at UCLA. Also currently looking at the AAP PLF job opportunities but I know less about this position. 

What is it like compared to AAP PLF'ing? Is it autonomous? What should I look out for?

Plagiarism Detected


It saddens me to say that we have detected plagiarism in some of the vibe checks. It is really unfortunate to see this— this course teaches you such important rhythms/flows that pinnacle our vibe. I’m sure you’ve heard it before but I’ll say it again: you’re undervibing yourself.


**

We will be reaching out to students on Sunday. If you email us before then and come forward about your plagiarism, we may be inclined to let you vibe with us again.

I really hope I don’t need to make this post again guys. Years from now you will laugh at the idea of a vibe check, but may more deeply appreciate the things you actually vibed with here.

so now i tried to get on the waitlist for the second class (first one got taken up within the day) and when my pass opens, there's only 2 waitlist spots. all it tells me is ""spring 2020 is activated w no issues"" instead of enrolling me into the class. both spots get taken up and now both classes are closed.

the only other chance i would have to take this class is this summer in ucla but unfortunately bc i have to visit sick relatives around september i can't take it for summer session c and there's legit no other CC that offers an equivalent to this class. 

i feel super disheartened because i feel as a transfer student we're given such a short period of time to get to do stuff we want. my cc told me to wait until uni to think of majors and minors and once i get to uni you're still on your own about that and we're given a tight schedule to complete requirements and the lack of leniency/flexibility makes it extremely difficult to be able to double major or minor. i'm so upset that i wish i chose another school so i could've had more academic freedom and at least an extra degree under my belt that would've been feasible had ucla not put such strict rules. idk what to think or do. psych dept won't accommodate so they won't let me take it fall quarter, they won't give a PTE number, nothing.

Canadian here who got accepted into UCLA but I’m confused if I should go to UCLA or UBC. UCLA is higher ranked on the US News ranking at 14 compared to UBC which is 30. The tuition is a lot more at UCLA too since I’m a international applicant, however I have won scholarships that will cover a good junk of the cost. L.A. and Vancouver are both beautiful cities and I like my hometown a lot, however L.A. would be a nice change. 

Does prestige matter a lot? Are there any Canadians here/ or do you know any Canadians who went to UCLA. I’m having a tough time deciding."

I just finished my first semester for my master's and am looking to apply this fall/winter for the fall 2021 semester's CS PhD program. My interests are largely ML and deep learning, and more specifically are geometric deep learning, imbalanced dataset ML, and financial ML.

I've been looking at the faculty and research labs at UCLA, and it actually doesn't seem like there are a lot of labs focused on ML (at least less than I thought).

Just an FYI, here are my stats:

GPA: 3.84/4.0 (1st semester of MS), 3.2ish/4.0 (undergrad)

GRE: 163V/169Q/5.5AW

Research: one publication in a domestic journal (Korea), one paper submitted to an int'l conference, involved in three other research projects as of now (not sure if these will actually lead to any ""real"" results, but hopefully they do).

What would be some tips or advice for me to raise my chances of admission? My biggest weak points right now are my undergrad GPA and lack of research publications. Does anyone here know any particular professors I should reach out to?

Any tips or advice are appreciated. Thanks!"

Your school does not want you to know the truth. Guess what? THERE ARE ROBOTS HERE. And let me tell you why.

&amp;#x200B;

1. UCLA does not want us to know information because they do not want Gen Z do grow too smart and powerful and surpass their weak ass boomers asses.
2. Notice the class selection. Notice how every class is coincidentally overlapping. Taking upwards of one class? Nearly impossible.
3. What does professor say on the first lecture of every class? ""We won't be able to get too deep into this because we only have 10 weeks, so this is going to be a broad overview."" WHY DOESN'T UCLA WANT US TO KNOW SPECIFICS??? There. is. knowledge. in. the. details.
4. I like to plan things. I'm a planner. But it's really fking hard to fking plan your classes when they're called ""Gender: Related Topics... Special Topics: Science.. Seminar: Why the Ancient Sea People Were Abstinent"". How the fk I'm supposed to know what kind of curriculum I'm looking at with these names? Oh, that's right, I'm looking at a WHACK curriculum. Which is what I get every quarter, without fail.
5. Now, I've met roughly 4 people at this school. Why are the classes full? How are they ALL full? Who are all of these strangers on campus at all times? I meet people who have no idea who they are, people who are protesting, I've never met a person who goes to this school here. It's all just families touring and people taking pictures. Who goes here??? I met this girl one time in class and she was the worst.

〰️ THE GRAND THEORY  〰️

Think about a class like Intro to Buddhism. A class that holds promise for enlightenment, knowledge, wisdom. Notice how it's rarely available? Just today, I saw that the 300 person lecture was full for next quarter already. Now ask yourself...Have I ever met anyone who has taken Intro to Buddhism? Think long and hard about this one.

No.

Because Into to Buddhism...DOESN'T EXIST.

Because they don't want us to be enlightened.

Fellas, you may be thinking:

oH

Nah....!!!

""My girlfriend took that class!""

I hate to break it to you, but that's not your girlfriend. That's a robot. Used to create the illusion that people are in that class.

But you say you have met someone who has taken that class?

They're a robot. Engineered by UCLA to create the illusion that class exists. Why do they want to pretend this class exists? So they can act like they offer a wide array of cultural knowledge to their students. Why don't they just actually have that class? CUS they DON want us to HAVE THAT KNOWLEDGE."

So I had this thought at like, 4 a.m. when I was taking a shower this morning. 

If I slipped and fell while taking a shower in a dorm causing me to die, HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE AUTHORITIES TO FIND ME?

Think of it. I've noticed every time that I take a shower when housing staff cleans the bathroom, they never open the stall/bother with it (obviously). Even if they did notice ""hey, every time I come in and clean the bathroom someone is using the shower"" they can't really do anything because it could be a different person every time they clean the shower and it just *happened* to be during the time to clean showers. 

Also, if my roommates haven't seen me for a while and became concerned, they could ask the locked stall if I was in there. But if I didn't answer, they'd just assume it's not me.

When reporting my financial info, I keep getting the error message ""You reported a total amount from the student's additional financial information fields that is high for the other income amounts reported.""

I am not sure what this error message means.

&amp;#x200B;

**My finances:**

I did not work in 2018 other than 4 hours of work-study that totaled $48 in earnings. I was not taxed on this income in my paycheck. It was simply $12 x 4 hours.

I also did not file taxes. I was claimed as a 'dependent' for tax purposes. However, I am considered 'independent' for FAFSA purposes as I am above the age of 24.

&amp;#x200B;

**FAFSA questions:**

For the question: ""Taxable earnings from need-based employment programs, such as Federal Work-study and need-based employment portions of fellowships and assistantships"" I answered $48.

For the question ""How much did you earn from working (wages, salaries, tips, etc.) in 2018?"" I have tried answering both $0 and $48 but still get the error message.

The only way I seem to be able to avoid the error message is if I answer $0 for federal work-study and $48 for earnings from work but that is not entirely accurate.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone know what is going on? Maybe I am missing something? I appreciate your help."

Just want to reach out for help and maybe help others who have a similar question.

So I'm a first-year at UCLA majoring in Neuroscience. I'll be filing for the DREAM Act (not FAFSA) this year, but I'm not sure what the outcome of my financial aid for the 2020-2021 school year will be.

Coming in as a high school senior, I received Cal Grant A which is approx. $12,500 per year.

Something to take into consideration is that since I'm a DACA recipient I get charged non-resident tuition.  In essence, my first year at UCLA was paid for especially with other outside scholarships I had that summed up $8,000.

Now, my first quarter was pretty rough and I failed my math and chemistry classes. Going into second quarter, so far I think I'll end up around a 2.5-3.0 GPA. My point is to show how poor my GPA is as of right now, this leads to my question.

Will my Cal Grant be revoked or will it switch down to Cal Grant B? This typpa stuff is making me more stressed because I'm a first gen student, and never in my life did I believe that my first year would be a total academic pitfall causing further impact in my financial status. Without Cal grant A, I'd have to pay a significant amount of money (which me and my dad don't have \*I only got one parent\*).

I really hope I can get some feedback just to be less confused, thank you guys"

However, grade distributions for both classes have been updated and the most recent one for psych 101 is absolutely horrible, among the worst I’ve seen as only 3% received an A. Meanwhile, the social psych lab i could’ve signed up for had over 70% As for spring 2019. Also, I was talking today with a classmate and she said she heard a lot of rough things about psych 101. Did I really fuck this up? If you’ve taken psych 101 before, how hard was it? I mainly signed up for it cuz the grade distribution hadn’t been updated at the time and it didn’t seem that bad for 101, plus I head psych 101 is the only lab that doesn’t require a research paper and is more exam focused (I’m better at exams than papers)."

I thought I'd share my generic template to all of you so that you can all make your very own 4YP. It's in Google Sheets so it should be easy to tweak anything you don't like.

Here is the link: [u/nuki989's generic 4yp](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z4clQTXfni6asQlkmUrNWHqMETTyQEqrEo2fYzeJEs8/edit?usp=sharing)

Just make a copy into your drive and delete the example colors!

Some of the features are:

* Quarters are color coded by year (Y1 is green, Y2 is red, Y3 is blue, Y4 is purple), more on that later
* There are enough spaces for you to put in 4 classes including 1 dual class (eg if it's a Writing II and GE you can use two color codes)
* Space on the right for you to write in the comprehensive list of major reqs, minor/double major reqs, GEs, etc
* A column for units you plan on taking (can be whatever you want, it's 15 by default)
* A column that tallies all units and gives them a color that coincides with your year (ie it will be Green if you are Freshman standing, Red is you are sophomore standing, etc)

I think the best part for me is the *color coding*: by blocking out your classes with a color code rather than a specific course title, you can plan a generic schedule that helps you plan ahead without being overly specific (ie I'm going to take two math classes and one mgmt class this quarter).

If you try to be too specific you will just have to constantly revisit your plan and readjust when classes inevitably fill up (ie ""I'm going to take Math 110A and Math 182 and Mgmt 169 in Fall quarter 2022""). Of course, you can still do this if you'd like, it's just a little bit of a time waster. 

Hope you guys enjoy!

Pro tips: To find a well formatted list of course titles, go to the Registrar for the department rather than the department website (some are really ugly). If you want a nice list of major reqs, type in ""\*Your Major\* Worksheet UCLA"" and you will get something like [this](https://www.eeb.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/171/2019/11/19F_BIOLOGY_Worksheet_4_18_19.pdf) or [these](http://statistics.ucla.edu/undergraduate/statistics-major-worksheets/)."
