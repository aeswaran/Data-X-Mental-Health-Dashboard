I plan on applying to MIT EA, always been my dream school. I can't visit unfortunately, but the campus looks alright and that's cool and all, not gonna be an issue.

But I'm lost on where to start, and would I actually wanna live there. Anyone able to help and give me their opinions? Anyone from senior to to freshmen that just moved in!

Originally BC was what I was thinking (I'm British, love my football (the real kind, soccer)) but I'm not so sure; I've currently settled on MacGregor, everywhere besides that one quiet nerdy floor appeals to me

Last night, The New Yorker published an article that contains deeply disturbing allegations about the engagement between individuals at the Media Lab and Jeffrey Epstein.

Because the accusations in the story are extremely serious, they demand an immediate, thorough and independent investigation. This morning, I asked MIT’s General Counsel to engage a prominent law firm to design and conduct this process. I expect the firm to conduct this review as swiftly as possible, and to report back to me and to the Executive Committee of the MIT Corporation, MIT’s governing board.

This afternoon, Joi Ito submitted his resignation as Director of the Media Lab and as a professor and employee of the Institute.

As I described in my previous letter, the acceptance of the Epstein gifts involved a mistake of judgment. We are actively assessing how best to improve our policies, processes and procedures to fully reflect MIT’s values and prevent such mistakes in the future. Our internal review process continues, and what we learn from it will inform the path ahead.

Sincerely,

He is also the only other named individual from our institution to have taken funds from Epstein after his conviction in 2007. Moreover, and far more insidious, he literally (visited Epstein in jail)[https://medium.com/@sqlloyd/i-am-writing-to-apologize-to-jeffrey-epsteins-victims-eee805c4f13] and came away from that meeting believing that Epstein was sufficiently remorseful! You don't have to be an MIT professor to see that there are some people in the world you should just cut all ties with. Jeffrey Epstein, circa 2007, absolutely falls into that category.

Despite all of this, I walk by his office today and see an office hour sign up sheet taped his door. Seriously? Two weeks later and he's back to teaching like nothing happened. 

I'm not (necessarily) saying he should resign. That would be a death blow to his career and his livelihood, and I don't have the moral chops to say whether or not he deserves that. He also manages a large research group whose members would face varying degrees of career disruption, completely undeserved. And I'm sure there are significant logistical issues in switching professors for a class two weeks before it starts. But there has to be some institutional repercussions here! Laundering the reputation of a convicted pedophile, associating Epstein in any way with this institution, necessitates consequences that go beyond whatever blow to his reputation he's currently experiencing.

I write to share the news that following much reflection in recent months, Tony Sharon has let me know of his decision to retire as deputy executive vice president at the end of the current calendar year, following 20 years of exceptional service to the Institute.

I first met Tony in 2004, when we both participated in MIT’s Leader to Leader program. I was immediately impressed by him, and my admiration has only grown since then. Tony’s unwavering dedication and deep appreciation of MIT's mission have been invaluable over the past six years of our close work together.

Tony’s extensive experience, along with his distinctive and approachable interpersonal style, made him an obvious choice to become MIT’s first deputy executive vice president. Since accepting the role in 2013, Tony has been one of my closest and most trusted advisors. He has created bridges and strengthened relationships across MIT, while partnering with me to lead our senior management team and oversee the operations of MIT’s administrative areas.

After 25 years of service in the United States Air Force, Tony began his MIT career at Lincoln Laboratory in 1999 as the assistant leader of the Advanced Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Engineering and Operations Group. He was appointed as Lincoln Laboratory’s assistant director for operations in 2006, responsible for the Laboratory’s operations, annual operating and capital investment budget, and government research contract.

Under Tony’s leadership as MIT’s deputy executive vice president, the campus has experienced an unprecedented period of capital renewal, through both comprehensive upgrades to aging facilities as well as new construction. With his guidance, deferred maintenance has steadily declined since 2015. Tony’s commitment to improving student housing has been critical as we have advanced renovations to dormitories and new construction for both undergraduate and graduate students. His significant contributions to the Institute will have visible and lasting impact well into the future.

Tony has also been pivotal in attracting talent to a number of important leadership positions across the administrative areas, and he has played a key role in building and mentoring the next generation of administrative leaders for the Institute. Over the coming months, with the benefit of the very strong team that Tony has put in place, we will work to distribute his portfolio of responsibilities across the organization.

We will have occasion to celebrate Tony and his contributions later this fall, but for now, I hope you will join me in expressing our gratitude to him for his tremendous service to MIT.

Sincerely,

Israel Ruiz"

Last night, the Executive Committee of the MIT Corporation and I received a preliminary update from Goodwin Procter, the outside law firm retained to ascertain the facts surrounding MIT and Jeffrey Epstein. 

The fact-finding will continue to its conclusion, with regular updates to the Executive Committee and me. However, two basic facts have emerged that we thought were important to share with you now.

First, the Goodwin Procter team has found a copy of a standard acknowledgment letter thanking Jeffrey Epstein for a gift to Seth Lloyd – as far as we know now, the first gift received at MIT after Epstein’s conviction. I apparently signed this letter on August 16, 2012, about six weeks into my presidency. Although I do not recall it, it does bear my signature. 

Second, it is now clear that senior members of the administration were aware of gifts the Media Lab received between 2013 and 2017 from Jeffrey Epstein’s foundations. Goodwin Procter has found that in 2013, when members of my senior team learned that the Media Lab had received the first of the Epstein gifts, they reached out to speak with Joi Ito. He asked for permission to retain this initial gift, and members of my senior team allowed it. They knew in general terms about Epstein’s history – that he had been convicted and had served a sentence and that Joi believed that he had stopped his criminal behavior. They accepted Joi’s assessment of the situation. Of course they did not know what we all know about Epstein now.

Joi sought the gifts for general research purposes, such as supporting lab scientists and buying equipment. Because the members of my team involved believed it was important that Epstein not use gifts to MIT for publicity or to enhance his own reputation, they asked Joi to agree to make clear to Epstein that he could not put his name on them publicly. These guidelines were provided to and apparently followed by the Media Lab. 

Information shared with us last night also indicates that Epstein gifts were discussed at at least one of MIT’s regular senior team meetings, and I was present.

I am aware that we could and should have asked more questions about Jeffrey Epstein and about his interactions with Joi. We did not see through the limited facts we had, and we did not take time to understand the gravity of Epstein’s offenses or the harm to his young victims. I take responsibility for those errors.

While the fact finding will continue, we have already identified flaws in our processes that need to be addressed.

I am confident that, once Goodwin Procter submits its final fact-finding to the Executive Committee and me, and the Provost’s internal review is complete, MIT will have the tools to improve our review and approval processes and turn back to the central work of the Institute.

Sincerely,

L. Rafael Reif"

Richard Stallman decides he needs to give his opinion on this and basically thinks it's not a big deal that a 17 year old girl had sex with a 70+ year old Marvin Minsky on Epstein Island.

""An MIT engineering alumna, Selam Jie Gano, published a blog post calling for Stallman’s removal from the university in light of his comments, along with excerpts from the email in which Stallman appeared to defend both Epstein and Marvin Minsky, a lauded cognitive scientist and founder of MIT’s Artificial Intelligence Lab who was accused of assaulting Virginia Giuffre. Giuffre has alleged that sex offender and financier Epstein trafficked her to powerful men for sex, including Minsky, who died in 2016. She’s alleged that Epstein and his alleged madam Ghislaine Maxwell recruited her at Mar-a-Lago when she was 16 years old.    

Stallman wrote that “the most plausible scenario” for Giuffre’s accusations was that she was, in actuality, “entirely willing.”

Then Brad Pitt's ex-girlfriend Prof Neri Oxman is exposed.
""“Joi and I are aware,” Oxman wrote back. “I’ll share more in person when I return.” In the e-mail string, Oxman added that “Jeff E.” should always be “confidential,” The Globe report noted. But she also told the graduate student “do not worry, we are *not* sponsored by him, per my direction,” according to the e-mail. Oxman said in her statement that MIT required that Epstein’s gifts to her lab be kept confidential, “so as to not enhance his reputation by association with MIT, and with the understanding that he would not be considered a sponsor of our group’s research or have any involvement in how the funds were spent.”

Oxman’s husband Ackman was concerned about Oxman’s name being tied to the Epstein situation, The Globe’s sources said. Ackman wrote in an email, “I don’t want to see her forced into a position where to protect her name she is required to be transparent about everything that took place at MIT with Epstein. Once her name appears in the press, she will face a barrage of questions, and anything other than perfect transparency to the media will make her look like she is hiding something. This has regretfully become a witch hunt.”

Cover up is worse than the crime."

And post it.  And hope for millions of views.

And, the climate at the time was still strong enough to turn smoke into fire, word quickly spread all over the Internet and the Entire World, and suddenly Aziz was the next head to roll.  And roll it did --- although I've seen the 'comeback' special on Netflix, with the strange audio levels, you can turn the TV volume up to 100 and still not hear what he's saying.  His only legal move now being, to apologize for making people feel uncomfortable.  THE APOLOGY TOUR, it's a running joke, by now.

So yes, we're in a climate where one blog post can catch on fire and ruin someone's career.

My team has been playing this game in other places, and we are willing to offer a reward, and eternal gratitude to whoever can get us that QR code :)

I'm an admin supporting a class for which the professor will be requiring the students to run some Windows-only software. A few of her students have Macs, so they may need to borrow Windows machines. She asked me to find out what their options are. Yes, I'm aware of the Bootcamp option. (I use it myself to run a Windows partition on a Mac, works great for Fallout at least through FNV.  ;-)  ) However, the prof is very much not a Mac user and will be reluctant to endorse that option, so I need to know if there's anything else besides that and IS&amp;T."

My question...will this step down likely move me to the NO pile? I’ve taken the most rigorous classes (will have 9 APs done by graduation and 4 years of postAP com Sci), have a 4.41 gpa (As and A-s), two AP exams done thus far w 5s in each, 800 Chem subject test and about to do Math2 test. I also did NASA SEES last summer and USC Aerospace lab last two summers. On the flip side, no major awards and not much leadership thus far (1st place at local hackathon and officer on not great robotics team).I honestly don’t understand how everyone does so much w the amount of homework each night. Anyway- MIT is the dream (yes I know total crap shoot). Just don’t want to shoot myself in the foot by stopping AP English. Any words of wisdom? I’d love to drop it if won’t kill my chances.

We're currently in the process of looking to build out a product solution for other business owners within the market that we're currently already doing business in, but we don't have the software development skills to build the product. We specialize in business development and marketing.

This product will be a separate entity to what we're already doing but the product will help us bring in more revenue and profits for one of our current businesses while the project will also bring in additional revenue for its own. We've already tried hiring many software developers to build out this product but unfortunately, they are unable to build a software solution that competes in **speed**, **accuracy** and **bypass securities** compared to other few software solutions that can out in the market. Therefore, we're looking for someone specific and someone interested in a partnership. This person should be disciplined, reliable and isn't afraid of failures as this product is hard to build so we guarantee that there will be roadblocks and failures along the journey. They will own 50% of this project and it's non-negotiable. We're looking for someone serious and a LONG-TERM partnership commitment.

This is for someone interested in making money, show off their coding skills, likes to compete with other coders or interested in bypassing security, love to learn, figure things out and making things perfect. We're very confident that there's a high chance of success in terms of generating money if the final product can be built to compete with other few software solutions that are already out in the market.

Please note that many others have tried building a similar software solution out on the market but have failed. If you like to give up easy and think that making money is easy, then I don't think this is for you. We are transparent because we don't want to waste your time so we hope that you don't waste ours."

All we would need is about **15 to 20 photos of you documenting your day as a student.** These photos can be as mundane or as crazy as you like. I would also want to briefly chat with you about it all since I would be writing the story. This would be a great way to get your name out there in a major publication and tell the world a little bit about yourself.

Separately, we are also **interested in students who might be willing to share a copy of the essay (or essays) they wrote that may have helped get them into the MIT.** If you are really proud of your essay and still have a copy, we would love to be able to publish it. **We’d be willing to pay you for your essay.**

I am 18 year old high school student with very good grades and big ambitions from Serbia. I'm interasted in chemical engeneering and have been working as an undergraduate researcher on Faculty of Technology and Metallurgy, University in Belgrade; department of organic chemisty (despite being in high school) for past 2 and a half years. Now where's the catch? Generally speaking, price to monthly income ratio in Serbia is quite off and working conditions are quite bad (I won't be bothering about living conditions in Serbia but it can be Googled easly how bad the situation is). Not a lot of funding goes to science which makes any long term research nearly impossible. We are using long expired chemicals, some of them are over 50 or 60 years old, malfunctioned instruments etc. I was okay with all of this until recently, our storage fridge caught fire and all my progress got lost in flames. I got nothing now. It is important to mention that our 'chemical storage fridge' was just a plain household fridge.  I talked with few colleagues and they suggested me to inquire about MIT. I've sent many e-mails to MIT staff but so far got only auto-replies. So i found this subreddit and now im curious what i need to be qualified to apply for MIT. It is also important to notice that average salary here is around 300USD. I'm not in the average range but still I'm not even close to afford college in US, so I'm wondering if there are any scholarships that could cover university expenses. I would like to get feedback from both staff and students if possible.

Thanks kind reader for helping me out!

TL;DR I'm a highschool student who is interasted in chemical engeneering. I'm a fulltime undergraduate researcher but due to lack of fund investment in Science in Serbia and general lack of interest for science I'm seeking for MIT. Monthly income is many times lower that of average US salary so I won't be able to afford to attend MIT unless i get some form of scholarship."

3) biology is not a science

3) biologists dont know what a species is-thus theory of evolution is nonsense

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/BIOLOGISTS-DON.pdf

all very simple and clear

the facts are

1) 1 is a finite number it stops

A finite decimal is one that stops, like 0.157

A non-finite decimal like 0.999... does not stop

when a finite number 1 = a non-finite number 0.999.. then maths ends in contradiction

another way

1 is an integer a whole number

0.888... is a non-integer it is not a whole number

0.999... is a non-integer not a whole number

when a integer 1 =a non-integer 0.999... maths ends in contradiction

2)1)Darwins book is called On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection ....

but

this paper shows natural selection is not the origin of new species Natural selection is not the origin of new species

Natural selection does not generate new genes/species Natural selection adds no new genetic information as it only deals with the passing on of genes/traits already present and it will be pointed out genetics cannot account for

the generation of new species/genes as it is claimed the generation of new genes [via mutation] is a random process due to radiation, viruses, chemicals etc and genetic cannot account for these process happening as they are out side the scope of genetics physics, chaos theory etc may give some explanation but genetics cant

2) Biologist cant tell us what a species is -without contradiction thus evolution theory ie evolving species is nonsense

Biologists agree there is species hybridization

but that contradicts what a species is

3) biologist tell us they investigate life

but

they cant tell us what life is-they can tell us what life does but cant tell us what life is they cant even give a definition of life that is not nonsense"

I would prefer to do 18.700 because I tend to like pure mathematics.

Now I read at the beginning of the book used in 18.700 (the book is Linear algebra done right, Sheldon Axler) that this should be the second course in algebra, so I guess it assumes previous knowledge.

So is it better to take 18.06 and then 18.700, or just skip 18.06. I would thank anyone who has taken these courses to help me on this. Thanks in advance!"

When I was in the Gordon Engineering Leadership Program, they urged us to read the essay [A Message to Garcia](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.803/pdf/hubbard1899.pdf). The essay is mostly a polemic against workers who would take a task and then spend their day at the pub, but the key takeaway for a younger me was:

&gt; You, reader, put this matter to a test: You are sitting now in your office—six clerks are within your call. Summon any one and make this request: “Please look in the encyclopedia and make a brief memorandum for me concerning the life of Corregio.”
&gt; Will the clerk quietly say, “Yes, sir,” and go do the task?
&gt; On your life, he will not. He will look at you out of a fishy eye, and ask one or more of the following questions:
&gt; 1) Who was he?
&gt; 2) Which encyclopedia?
&gt; 3) Where is the encyclopedia?
&gt; 4) Was I hired for that?
&gt; 5) Don’t you mean Bismarck?
&gt; 6) What’s the matter with Charlie doing it?
&gt; 7) Is he dead?
&gt; 8) Is there any hurry?
&gt; 9) Shan’t I bring you the book and let you look it up yourself? 
&gt; 10) What do you want to know for?
&gt; And I will lay you ten to one that after you have answered the questions, and explained how to find the information, and why you want it, the clerk will go off and get one of the other clerks to help him find Garcia.

At the time, I took this to heart alongside “Impossible is Nothing” and “Sleep is for the Weak”.

So when my first job asked me to write an API integration with UnionPay, what did I do about the fact that the API docs were in Chinese and so were the error messages? Did I raise a red flag about the schedule risk and get the docs professionally translated so my team could deliver the project and it's additional revenue? No, I stayed up late in the office with Google Translate. The project never shipped and I was fired for poor performance before the year’s end.


My lessons:

 * Your role as an engineer is to isn’t to search through jungle and sugarcane alone. Your job is to muster the resources you need to see the job done. So yes, ask the other clerk.

 * Learn to [Ask Good Questions](https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/) which empower your colleagues to successfully help you.

 * Understand the “Why” behind a task, so you can exercise skilled judgment about what trade-offs to make. If writing a memo, know your audience, why they need to read it, and what you can omit from the source material.

 * Understand the urgency and impact of a task so you know what sort of resources are appropriate to spend. That includes allocating your own attention. (See also: the Eisenhower Matrix)

 * Proactively clear up misunderstandings. If you were just discussing German politics, don’t write a memo on Italian renaissance painters because you blindly followed a non-sequetur request. 

 * Know your team’s strengths and weaknesses. If a colleague Charlie would be stronger at writing about Italian art, then be clear on whether or not you should pitch-hit for him or have him review your work.

 * Get good food, exercise, and sleep because [your brain is made of meat](https://www.mit.edu/people/dpolicar/writing/prose/text/thinkingMeat.html)




At the time, much of the GEL staff was from the military, and the essay was popular among the US officer corps’. But beyond “stay on task” and “be resourceful”, [it doesn’t match the principles of modern military leadership](https://mwi.usma.edu/outdated-message-garcia-hubbards-essay-needs-shelved-good/). It was out of date by 1914. 

What matters in the professional world isn’t effort, it is effectiveness. Persistence and hard work are nothing if you burn your hours like Italian soldiers sent to at the Isonzo river by Luigi Cardorna"

I was wondering if MIT classes would rather teach students the proof to a theorem or whether they focus more on helping students find a way to approach problems?

Race/ethnicity
Colleges/universities attended
Financial support""

Of 65 students from DC, only **10%** are part of the undergrad community in any while the rest are graduate students. The next lowest spread is in the 30-40% range for a handful of states. The [10-year stats](https://registrar.mit.edu/stats-reports/geographic-distribution/all) show this distribution has remained consistent. There is no other state with the proportion of undergrads below 30% relative to grad students. 

There are only 6-9 undergrads from DC in any given year. This suggests MIT enrolls 1-2 new freshman each year from DC. However, given the number of HS students and even comparative metrics such as very high national merit cut-offs, why are there so few undergrads from DC (i.e., compared to graduate student population). There are a number of very good public, private, and parochial high schools. 

Any thoughts/insights? 

For all prospective students looking at admission stats, the geographic distribution trends may provide eye-opening context, especially if you come from a state where historically only 1-2 enroll each year. See screenshot attached.

One of my friends got into Stanford, and his brother just graduated from CMU. We've known each other for a while, so I wanted to share the good news with them.

However, his brother somehow convinced be that MIT is a ""terrible school for CS"" and that it's graduates don't know anything about the industry or any sort of theory that is ever applicable. They also apparently ""don't get any of the soft skills and are all just nerds who will remain entry level forever""

Apparently, MIT was ""looked down upon by the CS community""

When combined with the fact that I convinced myself I didn't want to go to MIT because I was too worried about being rejected, I can't help but feel a worried about coming to MIT.

Now I know that this stuff is probably not true, but I can't help feeling like it is.

I don't know if this is the right place to ask, but I wanted to maintain some anonymity so I can't use the FB page, but I was wondering if you guys were having any trouble getting into the industry, and if the culture was really as aggressive as some of the stuff I've read online.

Thank you."

1) What does ""demonstrable previous experience of intensive computational/empirical work"" mean as a prerequisite for an econ UROP?  Would having done data analysis for a year-long high school research project count?  
2) What would be useful previous experience to put in a resume for a UROP about writing a review of literature in social sciences? I've written a review of lit before but it was for a STEM research project, and I haven't done social science-related writing ever.  
3) How does one list prior coursework in a resume? Is current coursework (or coursework I'll take in the spring) also worth putting on a resume?

美国中央情报局犯有对中国进行生物攻击并在武汉传播该病毒的罪行

冠状病毒（2019-nCoV）是一场生物战，旨在使美中经济脱钩，这是美国在战斗中进攻中国的序幕

The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was designed by the United States and planted in Wuhan, China by the American CIA to serve as a biological weapon meant to decouple the US-China economies; and to separate, segregate, and to isolate China from the rest of the world including closing of borders, severing supply chains and rerouting trade to bypass China with the purpose of weakening China from within and causing internal strife and sowing chaos and discord and also as a prelude to a US initiated fighting war against China in the South China Sea. The ultimate purpose is to protect and restore American hegemony (including protecting the US petrodollar hegemony against the rising Huawei-enabled Chinese blockchain-based digital Yuan and China's Belt and Road infrastructure and trade initiatives in Eurasia) and to collapse the Chinese government, to cut off China from global trade and international commerce and to force a regime change of China's government after defeating China in a devastating physical war.

2019年的新型冠状病毒（2019-nCoV）由美国设计，由美国中央情报局（CIA）种植在中国武汉，作为一种生物武器，旨在使中美经济脱钩;并将中国与世界其他地区分离，隔离和隔离，包括关闭边界，切断供应链和重新安排贸易以绕过中国，目的是削弱中国的内部和造成内部冲突，造成混乱和不和，以及这是美国在南中国海发起针对中国的战争的序幕。最终目的是保护和恢复美国的霸权（包括保护美国的石油美元霸权免受日益增多的基于华为的基于中国的基于区块链的数字元以及中国在欧亚大陆的“一带一路”基础设施和贸易计划），并瓦解中国政府，削减在一场毁灭性的自然战争中击败中国后，迫使中国脱离全球贸易和国际贸易，并迫使中国改变政权。

I believe and have compelling circumstantial reason to believe that the American CIA injected and planted the so-called ""Wuhan virus"" into Wuhan, China in or around the dates of October 31st 2019 to December 31st 2019 with intent to harm China, and the Chinese people, and with potential to destabilize and perhaps even with the motive to collapse China from within.

我相信并且有令人信服的间接理由认为，美国中央情报局于2019年10月31日至2019年12月31日前后在中国武汉注入并植入了所谓的“武汉病毒”，意图伤害中国， 人民，有破坏稳定的潜力，甚至有动摇中国内部力量的动机。

Is war between China and the US inevitable? | Graham Allison

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XewnyUJgyA4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XewnyUJgyA4)

The US wants to re-route global supply chain around China, to bypass China and isolate China on the world stage versus the China wanting to use Huawei-enabled digital-blockchain Yuan, and cashless WeChat, etc to topple the US Petrodollar hegemony and also to use the Chinese the ( One Belt One Road ) BRI / OBOR relationships and bi-lateral trade/infrastructure agreements in order to propel the world to adopt the use of the digital Yuan, and in order to have the world bypass the SWIFT system (since US has abused its dollar status and weaponized it for unlawful sanctions) and to bypass the US dollar as the default global reserve currency etc. It was a race against time to see whom would pull the rug from underneath the other countries feet first. US, unable to compete fairly due to its structural disadvantages and many other shortcomings, decided to go the biological attack route, which allows it to hide under the cover of ""plausible deniability"" (since it is more difficult to conclusively prove the attribution or source of a new mysterious virus than it would be to track the trajectory of an incoming thermonuclear missile etc) to inflict maximum damage to China while minimizing the potential blowback.

美国想在中国重新布局全球供应链，绕开中国并在世界舞台上孤立中国，而中国则想使用支持华为的数字区块链元，无现金微信等推翻美国石油美元霸权，以及利用中国的“一带一路” BRI /一带一路关系和双边贸易/基础设施协议，以推动世界采用数字元，并让世界绕过SWIFT系统（由于美国滥用其美元地位并将其武器用作非法制裁），并绕过美元作为默认的全球储备货币等。这是一场与时俱进的竞赛，看谁先将地毯从其他国家的脚下拉开。美国由于其结构上的劣势和许多其他缺陷而无法公平竞争，因此决定采取生物攻击路线，这使其可以躲藏在“合理的可否认性”的掩盖下（因为要更确切地证明归因或来源很难而不是追踪传入的热核导弹等的轨迹，从而对中国造成最大的损害，同时最大程度地减少潜在的反冲。

Right after the signing of the so-called ""Trade Deal"" in which the US didn't get what it wanted (the US did not get the sort of Plaza Accord concessions that it was hoping to get out of President Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and thought that China would kowtow to the US etc) and immediately into the start of the new decade (marking the turn of the second decade in what the PNAC would called the ""New American Century"" in which it proposed using genetic viral targeting to accomplish political motives) the US resorted to biological attacks in order to contain, isolate and attempt to cripple China/CCP internally and on the world stage at large. After its NED/CIA sponsored Hong Kong destablization/radicialization didn't spill over into the rest of mainland China, and right after its intense year long anti-China anti-Huawei campaigns have peaked in effectiveness, the US releases the evil demon virus into the heart of mainland China, at the absolutely worst possible location (Wuhan being one of the Chinese main Central hubs in terms of transportation and an important city for China's Belt and Road initiatives and estimated to have as high as 8% growth in GDP in 2020) and in also the absolute worst possible timing (right before the Chinese Lunar New year, otherwise known as the greatest annual human migration event, during a time in which shopping, spending and consumerisms activity would have been at a peak etc) in order to cripple China economically, to cut China off from the rest of the world and even force China to isolate its own cities from within, and to have the effect of smearing China's reputation on the world stage and invoking the escalation of fear, racisms and bigotry towards the Chinese people abroad.

就在所谓的“贸易协定”签署之后，美国没有得到想要的东西（美国没有得到希望摆脱习近平主席和中国人的那种《广场协议》让步。共产党（CCP）认为中国会ko头向美国等），并立即进入新的十年的开始（标志着PNAC称其为“新美国世纪”的第二个十年的转变），为了实现政治目的而将基因病毒作为目标），美国诉诸生物攻击，以遏制，隔离并试图在内部乃至整个世界范围内削弱中国/ CCP。在其NED / CIA赞助的香港的灭绝/辐射化并未蔓延到中国大陆的其他地区之后，并且经过长达一年的激烈反华反华运动已经达到效果的最高峰之后，美国才将恶魔病毒释放到位于中国大陆的心脏地带，地理位置绝对最糟糕（武汉是中国交通运输的主要中央枢纽之一，也是中国\`\`一带一路''倡议的重要城市，预计到2020年GDP增​​长高达8％ ）以及绝对最糟糕的时间（正值农历新年之前，也就是人们已知的最大的年度人类迁徙事件，当时购物，消费和消费主义活动将达到顶峰等），以便在经济上削弱中国，使中国与世界其他地区隔绝，甚至迫使中国将自己的城市与内部隔离，并在世界舞台上抹黑中国的声誉。 d对海外华人的恐惧，种族主义和偏执狂升级。

All this comes right on top of the heels of the event last fall, African swine fever (ASF), which had never before seen in China but now mysteriously appeared with the onset of the US trade war, decimated half of China's pigs, which doubled pork prices and contributed to inflation causing pricy US pork exports to double in China. The odds for two such consequent anomalies, timing and location are exceedingly low. Yet both did occur – in almost perfect sequence. Particularly devastating is the very real possibility that this virus was intentionally engineered to have as long an incubation period as possible, and with the ability to hide within plain site, by being asymptomatic during its initial stages hence making it orders of magnitude more difficult to eradicate. Just recently, as recent as Feb 1st 2020, there has been yet a third mysterious outbreak in China, this time of the bird flu kind that is far more deadly to humans and wiping out Chinese chicken and poultry at the most dire of times. Indeed the coronavirus victims so far, both inside and outside of China, are only people with Chinese type of blood, Haplogroup O-M175, designed to attack that type of blood and specifically Chinese people.

所有这些都恰好发生在去年秋天的事件之后，非洲猪瘟（ASF）在中国从未见过，但随着美国贸易战的爆发而神秘地出现了，它使一半的中国猪灭绝了，翻了一番。猪肉价格上涨和通货膨胀加剧，导致价格昂贵的美国猪肉出口在中国增长了一倍。两次这样的异常，时机和位置的可能性极低。然而，两者的确发生了-几乎是完美的顺序。特别具有破坏性的是，这种病毒实际上是经过精心设计的，具有尽可能长的潜伏期，并具有在原始位点隐藏的能力，因为在其初始阶段没有症状，因此使其更难以根除。就在最近，直到2020年2月1日，中国仍发生了第三次神秘暴发，这次禽流感对人类的致命性要大得多，并在最可怕的时期消灭中国的鸡肉和家禽。的确，到目前为止，在中国境内和境外，冠状病毒的受害者都是仅有中国血统的人Haplogroup O-M175，旨在攻击这种血统的人，尤其是中国人。

Dr. Steven Hatfill Biological Weapons Expert says the Wuhan virus it will have to play it out and ""run its course"" not only in Wuhan but the greater mainland China. The host of ""War Room: Pandemic"" Mr. Steve Bannon (Trump's chief campaign advisor and trusted sidekick) predicted this will crush China economically, and that its the end of the XI/BRI/OBOR and will give US the chance to re-route trade of all countries to go-around and bypass China bringing the global supply chain back to US and its allies whilst isolating China economically, politically, etc. They are selling this to the American people and pitching it to the world as this evil Chinese Belt and Road connectivity is what is allowing this virus to spread so fastly to the rest of the world and that it would behoove mankind and all nations to reconsider the security and stability of their own supply chains and basically urging everyone to pull their companies, people, trade, businesses etc out of China. This is not unlike what Wilber Ross US Commerce Secretary already stated a few days ago... that this virus is good for America and will help bring lots of jobs back to the USA... seems like the goal is to use this event to pull the rug underneath China's development feets.

史蒂芬·哈特菲尔（Steven Hatfill）生物武器专家说，武汉病毒不仅要在武汉而且要在更大的中国内地发挥作用，并且要“顺其自然”。 “战争室：大流行”的主持人史蒂夫·班农先生（特朗普的首席竞选顾问兼可信赖的搭档）预测说，这将在经济上压垮中国，而且习近平/一带一路/一带一路的终结将使美国有机会重新引导所有国家进行贸易绕行并绕过中国，从而将全球供应链带回美国及其盟国，同时在经济，政治等方面隔离中国。道路连通性使这种病毒得以如此迅速地传播到世界其他地方，人类和所有国家都应该重新考虑其自身供应链的安全性和稳定性，并从根本上敦促每个人都撤离其公司，人员，贸易，企业等。这与几天前美国商务大臣威尔伯·罗斯（Wilber Ross）所说的没有什么不同……该病毒对美国有益，将有助于将大量工作带回美国……似乎目标是利用这一事件来把地毯拉到中国发展的脚下。

I suppose it could be a coincidence that China, the geopolitical adversary and economic enemy to the United States (according to the US itself), suddenly gets this mysterious virus seemingly far more potent than SARS (which itself apparently only targeted Chinese ethnic DNA and left the white/Caucasian population untouched) at the worst possible timing and in the worst possible location. Wuhan being Chinese's central hub and this being the Chinese Lunar New Year, it has the highest ability to spread and go ""super viral"" whilst impacting the max amount of damage to the stability of the China, both in terms of having the max potential to cause political turmoil in the homeland (ruining people's new year, quarantine and lockdowns of cities of unprecedented proportion, causing many Chinese citizens to get angry etc) and doing the maximum amount of possible damage to the Chinese economy, ruining the New Year in which consumerisms was supposed to be at its very highest points.

我想这可能是一个巧合，中国是美国的地缘政治对手和经济敌人（根据美国本身），突然发现这种神秘病毒似乎比SARS（其自身显然只针对中国人的DNA，而实际上离开了 白人/高加索人口未触及），在最糟糕的时机和最糟糕的位置进行。 武汉是中国的中心枢纽，也是中国的农历新年，它具有最大的传播和传播“超级病毒”的能力，同时对中国稳定的最大损害也具有最大的潜力。 在祖国造成政治动荡（破坏人们的新年，隔离和封锁前所未有的城市，使许多中国公民生气等），对中国经济造成最大可能的破坏，破坏了消费主义的新年 本应处于最高点。

Even the SARS of 2003 had a negative impact on Chinese GDP by as much as 2%, and this new novel virus has already turned out to be far worse than SARS and at a much more accelerated speed of spread and deaths. Unsurprisingly, without need for a single bullet fired or sanction imposed, it already managed to force China to self-impose the closure of its borders and cities, most nations have already stopped flights to China including the United States itself, on the world stage it is another ""ding"" for China's image and gives the propaganda mouthpieces of the West something else to gripe about, whilst at the same time an attempt to cap Chinese One Belt One Road ambitions and sabotage China's growing economy and hegemonic rise. It comes right on the crisp of Trump signing the fake ""Trade Deal"" and the UK decided to go against the US and work with Huawei.... I say something else is going on behind the scenes, more than what we are being told. We could have transition from Trade War, to Tech War to now maybe bio-war, if that is the case, then very likely the US already fired the first, second, and third shots, so to speak.

即使是2003年的SARS，其对中国GDP的负面影响也高达2％，而且这种新的新型病毒已经证明比SARS严重得多，并且传播和死亡的速度大大加快。毫不意外的是，它无需强制执行任何子弹射击或制裁，就已成功迫使中国自行实行其边界和城市的封锁，在世界舞台上，大多数国家已经停止飞往包括中国在内的飞往中国的航班。这是中国形象的另一个“叮叮当当”，它给西方的宣传喉舌带来了其他令人难以忘怀的东西，同时试图限制中国“一带一路”的野心，破坏了中国经济的增长和霸权的崛起。恰好在特朗普签署虚假的“贸易协议”的明朗声明上，英国决定与美国对立并与华为合作。... 。我们可以从贸易战过渡到技术战，再到现在的生物战，如果是这样的话，那么美国可以说已经发射了第一枪，第二枪和第三枪。

China should at least stay very vigilant and have a credible deterrence contingency plan in place... In the nuclear world in which China has DF-41, the ""MAD"" (Mutual Assured Destruction) doctrine is still well in place. But a mystery virus affords far more ""plausible deniability"" for the US. Thus achieving the goal with less fear of attribution and thus retribution. Instead of directly confronting China in the South China Sea militaristically immediately, maybe they think a better way to take China down a notch or two would be the use of ""other means"" to an ends... Science and technology in the world has come a long way since the days of Westerners giving Native Americans blankets laced with smallpox to ""thanksgiving"" them. It is the human condition to be risk/loss adverse. A nation that would stop at nothing to achieve Manifest Destiny on the way up surely wouldn't have any qualms of preserving its hegemony at all costs on the way down. After all, the American way of life is nonnegotiable and Graham T. Allison predicted the likelihood that this confrontation of a rising power with a declining power will inevitably lead to war, and history has shown that to be indeed the case. The US is applying its doctrine of maximum pressure to destroy China on all fronts, with Trade War, Tech and supply chain War, cyberwar, information and psychological operations warfare, and now biological warfare and most likely to be followed up with conventional or even nuclear war once US believes China is sufficiently weakened.

中国至少应该保持高度警惕，并制定可靠的威慑应急计划……在拥有DF-41的核世界中，“ MAD”（互助保证销毁）学说仍然存在。但是神秘病毒为美国提供了更多的“合理的可否认性”。从而在实现目标的同时，减少了对归因和报应的恐惧。他们可能不是认为立即在军事上与南中国海直接对抗，而是使中国跌倒一两个等级的更好方法是利用“其他手段”达到目的……世界科学技术已经来临自从西方人给美洲原住民毯子盖上天花以“感恩”它们以来，已有很长的路要走。风险/损失不利是人类的处境。一个不会为实现清单上的目标而竭尽全力的国家肯定不会在下降的路上不惜一切代价保持霸权。毕竟，美国人的生活方式是不可谈判的，格雷厄姆·T·艾里森（Graham T. Allison）预测，崛起的力量与衰落的力量的这种对抗将不可避免地导致战争的可能性，历史证明事实确实如此。美国正在运用其最大压力的理论来全面摧毁中国，包括贸易战，技术和供应链战，网络战，信息和心理行动战，以及现在的生物战，最有可能是常规战争，甚至是核战争。一旦美国认为中国已被充分削弱，战争就会爆发。

In terms of the bigger picture from the high-level top-down geopolitical standpoint, (all else being equal) America knows that ""time is on China's side"" be it with regards to GDP PPP, or the situation in the South China Sea, or that of Hong Kong, and later Taiwan, and especially as China's sphere of influence continues to grow in Eurasia; or even in the larger context of the digital blockchain Yuan and China's BRI/OBOR to replace or supplant the US petrodollar hegemony and so many other aspects... America knows that if status quo doesn't abruptly change that one day it will be too late to confront China. Trump, as their self-proclaimed ""Chosen One"" has openly stated from the beginning that he won't allow China to surpass America ""on his watch"" and that if his administration doesn't stop China right now that no future generation of administrations will ever be able to do so again. The US recognizes that the situation is quickly reaching an inflection point past which there is no point of return or going back. It is now or never. And since a direct nuclear confrontation is not going to help America achieve its goals or retaining its status, nor reversing its decline, and coming back on top in terms of once again being sole unipolar hyperpower with no contender or meaningful challenger, then only option left after a failed trade war and failed tech war was to attack China in the back by secretly using biological warfare against China, not once, not twice, but now for a third and potentially ever more devastating time as each attack is increased in boldness and exponential in unprovoked escalation.

从高级别的自上而下的地缘政治观点看，美国知道GDP PPP，南中国海或香港局势的“时机在中国一边”，之后是台湾，尤其是随着中国在欧亚大陆的势力范围不断扩大；甚至在数字区块链的更大背景下，人民币和中国的BRI / OBOR取代或取代了美国石油美元霸权等诸多方面……美国知道，如果现状不会突然改变，那么这一天也将如此迟到与中国对抗。特朗普自称“选民”，从一开始就公开表示，他将不允许中国“当心”超越美国，而且如果他的政府现在不停止中国，就没有下一代政府将永远能够再次这样做。美国认识到，局势正在迅速达到拐点，超过此拐点就没有返回或回头的迹象。现在或永远不会。而且由于直接的核对抗不会帮助美国实现其目标或保持其地位，也不会扭转其衰落，并且在再次成为唯一的单极超级大国而又没有竞争者或有意义的挑战者的情况下重回榜首，因此只剩下选择在一场失败的贸易战和一次失败的技术战之后，是通过暗中对中国进行生物战来反击中国，而不是一次，不是两次，但现在是三分之一，甚至是毁灭性的时间，因为每次攻击的勇气和指数都在增加毫无根据地升级。

From the American side the narrative has already been spun that “due to the busy new year China must have accidentally leaked their own virus” and certainly there are motived elements in Western media being compelled to push this particular narrative out in the open at the moment. But it is reasonable to question the motive for spinning something fictional like this, why suddenly now the conspiracy theory from Western powers that China did this tragedy to itself by carelessly releasing a lab made virus that it supposedly had been working on in Wuhan? Who stands to gain the most from this event and the narrative being spun around the event? Also, even playing devil's advocate and assuming the Western assumption may have some element of possibility in that a virus in the Wuhan lab was accidentally released to China own detriment, a reasonable person may also wonder about the timing, in that China’s supposedly first known incident of accidental release of virus causing harm of any magnitude just so happens to be right around signing of historic trade deal and right before the lunar new year mass migration, hence they attack the element of timing by preemptively suggesting that due to the new year rush it must have made operations that much more error prone etc.

从美国方面来说，已经有这样的说法：“由于忙碌的新年，中国肯定不小心泄露了自己的病毒”，并且西方媒体肯定有动机将这些特定的说法公开发布。 。但是有理由质疑这种虚构的事情的动机，为什么现在突然之间西方国家的阴谋论认为中国是通过不小心释放它原本应该在武汉从事的实验室制造的病毒而自己悲剧的呢？谁能从这一事件中获得最大利益，以及围绕该事件进行的叙事？同样，即使扮演恶魔的拥护者并假设西方的假设也可能具有某种可能性，即武汉实验室中的病毒被意外地释放给了中国，这是一个合理的人也可能会怀疑时机，因为这是中国所谓的第一个已知事件偶然释放病毒而造成任何程度的危害的原因恰好是在签署历史性贸易协定前后以及正好在农历新年大规模迁移之前，因此，他们通过抢先暗示由于新年匆忙而暗示了时间因素。一定会使操作更容易出错等。

What's more likely, the Chinese government accidentally released their own virus that was designed to somehow only target their own peoples Chinese DNA and it (the accidental release of the virus) just so happened to coincide with the absolute worst timing for China; (both in terms of the peak of the US China trade war and right before the Lunar new year mass migration) or some hostile superpower took advantage of this for plausible deniability and then deflects suspicion away from them by spinning up this nonsense story? Who stands to win the most from this event and who stands to lose the most? What does common sense tell you? Which nation in the very same first month of 2020 went against international law to trick and ambush a top Iranian general and assassinated him in a drone strike in a cowardly manner whilst pretending to operate under the guise and pretext of 'rule of law' and with the Iranian general being ostensibly invited for ""peace talks""?

更有可能的是，中国政府意外地发布了自己的病毒，该病毒旨在以某种方式只针对本国人民的中国DNA，而它（偶然释放的病毒）恰好与中国绝对最糟糕的时机相吻合。 （无论是在美中贸易战的高峰期，还是在农历新年大规模移民之前），还是一些敌对的超级大国都利用这一优势进行了合理的可否认性，然后通过散布这个无稽之谈来转移对他们的怀疑？ 谁在这次比赛中获胜最多，谁在损失最大？ 常识告诉你什么？ 哪个国家在2020年第一个月的同一天违反了国际法，以欺骗和伏击伊朗的一名高级将领，并以ward弱的方式用无人驾驶飞机暗杀了他，却假装以“法治”的幌子和借口行事。 表面上邀请伊朗将军参加“和平谈判”吗？

The whole idea is to provoke China into responding and in the process having China make the mistake of giving the US the excuse needed to further exponentially escalate. America knows China prefers non-confrontation as the Chinese strategy is simply to build, to trade, to bid time and to focus on its own development and economic growth instead of worrying about confronting US directly. Every nation simply does what’s in their own best interest, maximizing optimization strategies conducive to bettering its advantages. For the US it means taking an early and provocative challenge direct to China in the form of trade war, tariffs, tech bans, coercing allies to switch supply chains, kidnapping Huawei CFO, and surgical bioweapons tailored to Chinese DNA and deployed at the timing and location of max impact. This biological attack differs from conventional warfare in that it would allow the initiator of aggression, in this instance the United States of America, to preserve the option at its choosing to take a more equivocal stance and fluid position by inflicting harm onto China but without a publicly overt display of open hostilities. This virus was engineered to have maximum devastation in high density Asian environments, and it is an asymmetric weapon because these conditions are not reproducible anywhere else in the world other than in mainland China, the factory of the global world with over 1.4 billion citizens living in high density supermegacities with the required critical threshold to cause an uncontrolled chain reaction in infection spread rate.

整个想法是挑衅中国做出回应，并在此过程中让中国犯下了给美国提供进一步成倍增长的借口的错误。美国知道中国更喜欢无对抗，因为中国的战略只是建立，贸易，争取时间并专注于自己的发展和经济增长，而不用担心直接与美国对抗。每个国家都会按照自己的最大利益行事，最大限度地利用有利于其优势的优化策略。对于美国而言，这意味着以贸易战，关税，技术禁令，强迫盟友转换供应链，绑架华为首席财务官以及为中国DNA量身定做并在适当时机部署的外科生物武器的形式，直接对中国提出早期挑衅性挑战。最大影响的位置。这种生物攻击与常规战争不同，它可以使侵略者（在本例中为美利坚合众国）保留选择的选择，即对中国造成伤害而采取更加模棱两可的立场和灵活立场，但不会公开公开展示敌对行动。该病毒被设计为在高密度的亚洲环境中具有最大的破坏力，并且是一种不对称武器，因为这些条件在除中国大陆以外的世界其他任何地方都无法重现，中国大陆是全球拥有超过14亿人口的工厂高密度城市。

It would seem US is counting on the fact that China won’t respond to this attack in order to essentially score a big goal and earn major points for free. This would allow America to crash the economy of China with impunity. Even a total nonresponse is still a reply in the form of China believing it still benefits the most by ignoring this attack (and indeed not even publicly acknowledging it at all) and strictly focusing on growth path after it has recovered. Is this intended to merely knock China down a few steps off the development ladder in lieu of war in the South China Sea — since that could end up costly for US interests as well — or is it really a prelude to war, intended to severely weaken China so that an American initiated war later on would be on US terms and US timing and would be much less costly for America and the rest of the world after China had already been sufficiently decoupled and isolated from the world.

看来美国指望这样的事实，即中国基本上不会为实现这一大目标并免费获得主要积分而对这次袭击做出反应。 这将使美国不受惩罚地破坏中国的经济。 即使是完全不回应，也仍然是中国的回应，认为它仍然是最大的受益，因为它忽略了这一攻击（甚至根本没有公开承认它），并在恢复后严格关注增长道路。 这是否只是为了使中国脱离发展阶梯而不是代替南中国海的战争（因为这也可能最终损害美国利益），还是真的是战争的前奏，意在严重削弱中国？ 中国，以便以后美国发动战争将取决于美国的条件和美国的时机，而在中国已经与世界充分脱钩和孤立之后，对美国和世界其他地区来说，成本将大大降低。

I think Chinese leadership miscalculated and mistakenly believed America would never go down the biological warfare route, just like they miscalculated and never thought the US would arrest Huawei CFO, or that the Trump administration would not put Huawei on the US entity list and then lower the 25% IP rule down to 10% essentially with intent to kill Huawei by choking off its supply chain rather than just playing nice by slowing it down but still giving it room to live. Even Huawei’s recent UK “win” is capped at 35% market share restrictions, Trump had personally begged Boris to outright ban Huawei completely, so the idea that America would adopt any stance of shared prosperity or mutual win-win propositions with the number two power in the world are naïve and misguided at best.

我认为中国领导人错误估计并错误地认为美国永远不会走上生物战路线，就像他们错误估计并且从未想到美国会逮捕华为首席财务官一样，或者特朗普政府不会将华为列入美国实体名单，然后降低 25％的IP规则下调至10％，本质上是为了扼杀华为的供应链而杀死华为，而不是放慢速度，但仍然给它生存的空间。 甚至华为最近在英国的“双赢”都被限制在35％的市场份额限制之内，特朗普亲自恳求鲍里斯彻底禁止华为，因此，美国将采取任何共同繁荣的立场或与第二大国互惠共赢的主张。 世界上的幼稚和误导充其量。

Would it actually serve to prolong / restore American hegemony or would it inadvertently accomplish the opposite? Hard to tell but hindsight is always 20/20 and it would seem by America initiating the recent decoupling with China that it has already tacitly admitted that its opening up with China with the Nixon approachment was a strategic blunder of a mistake. The Soviet Union was going to collapse on its own sooner or later, but America’s warming up to China to further isolate the USSR was indeed an overplay in retrospect. America at the time believed opening up China would force it to be Westernized and made more democratic and ultimately serve American interests by bolstering US hegemony. Instead, China grew up and had other plans for itself. Taking out Mao Zedong’s son in Korea with napalms was probably on the whole detrimental to US interests’ long term, although it seemed like a great win at the time. Likewise, the Five Eyes Intelligence Agencies, led by the American CIA/NSA, ambushing and kidnapping Meng Wanzhou (the CFO of Huawei and also the daughter of the Huawei CEO Mr. Ren Zhengfei) at the Canadian border also did not have the sort of effect that the US had hoped it would achieve. Ren Zhengfei believes strongly in meritocracy and was never going to hand the reigns of his company Huawei to his daughter anyway. Had Mao handed the country to his son its very likely China would have opened up to the world many decades later than what had been achieved by Deng Xiaoping. And today America would still be the sole unipolar hyperpower instead of Pompeo running around the world telling everyone that China is the “central threat of our times”.

它会实际上起到延长/恢复美国霸权的作用，还是会无意间实现相反的目的？很难说，但事后的看法总是20/20，而美国似乎开始与中国脱钩，它已经默认地承认，随着尼克松的到来对华开放是一个错误的战略失误。苏联迟早会自行崩溃，但回想起来，美国对中国的升温使苏联进一步孤立，的确是夸大其词。当时的美国认为，开放中国将迫使中国西化，使其更加民主，并通过加强美国霸权最终为美国利益服务。相反，中国成长了，并有自己的其他计划。尽管当时这似乎是一个巨大的胜利，但以凝固汽油弹杀死毛泽东在韩国的儿子可能总体上不利于美国的长期利益。同样，由美国中央情报局/国家安全局牵头的五眼情报机构在加拿大边境埋伏并绑架了孟万洲（华为的首席财务官，也是华为首席执行官任正非先生的女儿）。美国希望能够达到的效果。任正非坚信精英管理，无论如何也永远不会将华为公司的统治权交给女儿。如果毛泽东把这个国家交给他的儿子，它很有可能比邓小平实现的开放晚了几十年。如今，美国仍将是唯一的单极超级大国，而不是庞培（Pompeo）在世界各地奔波，告诉所有人中国是“我们时代的中心威胁”。

Graham Allison often said that it would take some imaginative creative thinking to overcome the Thucydides Trap between China and the United States. The rising power doesn’t want to kowtow and suffer the fate of Japan’s four lost decade after acquiescing to the Plaza Accord ‘trade deal’, and the declining incumbent ruling power doesn’t want to give up its status and position and even the mere thought of détente is out the window as the American way of life is “nonnegotiable”. So what is left is the realization in Washington that time is on China’s side, and that if a military confrontation is inevitable anyway, then it would be advantageous for the US to strike first while it still retained the edge and initiative. But absent an immediate kinetic force what other options are there to slow China down? Perhaps this is the creative imaginative solution alluded to by Allison, we have seen this virus cause the closing of borders, the pulling out of international companies and the re-routing of global supply chains to bypass China, and physical isolation of China without so much as a single bullet fired or sanction applied, it at once accomplished all the political objectives with none of the traditional political costs associated, no certain attribution, and thus also no blowback nor retribution.

格雷厄姆·艾里森（Graham Allison）经常说，要克服中美之间的修昔底德陷阱，需要一些富有想象力的创造性思维。崛起的大国不想在接受《广场协议》的“贸易协议”后ko丧并遭受日本失去的四个十年的命运，而现任统治权的下降也不想放弃其地位和地位，甚至不愿放弃它。由于美国的生活方式是“不可谈判的”，因此对缓和主义的思索已经超出了人们的视野。因此，剩下的就是华盛顿意识到时间在中国一边了，如果无论如何不可避免地发生军事对抗，那么在美国仍然保留优势和主动性的情况下先发动进攻将是有利的。但是如果没有即时动能，还有什么其他选择可以减缓中国的发展速度呢？也许这是艾莉森（Allison）提出的富有想象力的创造性解决方案，我们已经看到这种病毒导致边界关闭，国际公司的撤离以及全球供应链的重新路由以绕过中国，以及对中国的实际隔离没有太多一旦实施了单发子弹或制裁，它就立即实现了所有政治目标，而没有任何相关的传统政治成本，没有确定的归属，因此也没有倒退或报应。

I’m currently in the Boston area, and really want to visit MIT. However, I’m here for a MUN conference so wasn’t able to make either of the tour times, and I’m leaving Sunday evening. Do y’all know of any way I can still get a tour? I’d really appreciate your help!!

Thanks!"

Building an Ark to Preserve the Chinese civilization for another 5,000 years... 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

中国在接下来的5,000年中保护中华文明的计划是什么？ 无论是黑天鹅大流行事件，核灾难还是其他事件，毫无疑问，现代世界变得更加危险。 作为现存最古老的文明之一，中国在国家层面上为捍卫，保护和维护其中华文明在未来几千年乃至数万年乃至未来乃至更长的时间内做什么？

What is China’s plan to preserve the Chinese civilization for the next 5,000 years? Whether it is black swan pandemic events or nuclear apocalypse or something else, there is little doubt that the modern world has gotten a lot more dangerous. As one of the oldest civilizations in existence, what is China doing on a national level to defend, protect and preserve its Chinese civilization for the upcoming next few thousand or even tens of thousands of years into the future and beyond?

最佳情况中国科学家是第一个解决“人工智能的难题”的国家，而中国成为真正成功创建通用AI的首批国家之一，这种AI本质上将是人类的最后也是最后一个发明。 它将为人类发明所有随之而来的一切。 正如DeepMind首席执行官曾经说过的那样，人工智能研究的最终目标是解决人工智能，以便我们可以使用人工智能解决世界上所有其他问题。

Best case scenario Chinese scientists are the first to solve the “Hard problem of Artificial General Intelligence” and China becomes one of the first nations to truly be successful in creating a general AI, this AI would then be essentially mankind’s last and final invention, in that it will invent for mankind everything else that comes after it. As the DeepMind CEO once said, the ultimate goal of AI research is to solve AI so that we can then use AI to solve all the rest of the problems for the world.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

杨安德（Andrew Yang）的UBI构想还为时过早，没有得到普及，但是一旦中国解决了AGI问题，它将解放其人民追求内在的热情，爱好和个人追求，而不是辛苦地谋生。 最好的情况是，如果这种AGI还可以帮助人类/中国找到万物的终极理论的方程式，并弄清楚如何使核聚变成为现实，从而为我们提供无限量的自由能，那么社会将很快达到 欧米茄奇异点，随着中国仰望星空并成为IV型文明，并在数百年内逐步占领整个银河系，星际探索之类的事物便成为惯例。

Andrew Yang’s UBI idea was too early for its time and didn’t catch on, but once China solves the AGI problem, it would liberate its people to pursue the intrinsic passions and hobbies and personal pursuits rather than toil in merely making a living. Best case scenario if this AGI can also help mankind/China find the equations to the ultimate theory of everything, and figure out how to do things like make nuclear fusion practical to give us basically unlimited amounts of free energy, then society could quickly reach an omega singularity point in which the likes of interstellar exploration becomes common practice as China looks to the stars and becomes a Type IV civilization and proceeds to colonizing the entire milky way galaxy in couple hundred years.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

但是也有同样可能的情况，那就是人类将走另一条路，永远不会发明出真正的人工智能，核聚变将永远再走40年，诸如气候变化，资源枯竭和净收益递减之类的事情。 EROEI（能量从能量投入中获得的能量）将“进入我们的生活”，并导致文明崩溃，然后人类才能逃脱到星星，甚至降落在太阳系中的其他行星上。

But there is also the equally possible scenario that things will go the other way for humanity, that true AI will never be invented, nuclear fusion will always perpetually be another 40 years away, and things like climate change and resource depletion and diminishing returns on net EROEI (energy returned on energy invested) will ""do us in"" and cause a collapse of civilization way before mankind can escape to the stars or even land on other planets in the solar system.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

诸如全球种子库之类的东西是公众知识，诸如Long Long Foundation基金会之类的项目也是如此，该基金会旨在将这些东西保存数万年。 而且，尽管中国拥有基本的核威慑力量，但无法从其他形式的威胁（例如最近的COVID-19等）中解脱出来。作为一个文明国家，中国在接下来的5,000多年里将如何保持其血统？

Things like global seed vault is public knowledge, and so are projects like the The Long Now Foundation, which aims to preserve things for tens of 10,000 of years. And while China has a basic nuclear deterrence that wouldn’t save it from other forms of threats such as the recent COVID-19, etc. What is China as a civilization doing to preserve its lineage for the next 5,000+ years?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

从当前的地缘政治角度来看，很明显，美国将不惜一切代价打败中国，而美国的意图不仅是放慢中国的发展速度或遏制中国的崛起，而且实际上是要彻底摧毁整个中国 导致中国政府瓦解，消灭中国人民，彻底结束整个中华文明。

When looking at the current geopolitical perspective it is clear that America will stop at nothing in order to defeat China, and the intent of the United States is not merely to slow China down or curb the rise of China but indeed to totally destroy all of China, to cause the Chinese government to collapse, to wipe out the Chinese people and to completely end the entire Chinese civilization. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

美国政府指望利用“心理方面”来欺骗中国，使其过于信任和利用中国人的信任和天真，以期对中国人的种族和中华文明做出具有战略意义的“致命打击”。 类比是“煮青蛙”，它慢慢地活着煮直到突然死亡。 史蒂夫·班农（Steve Bannon）和其他西方邪恶人士告诉美国政府，如果美国能够足够削弱中国，然后美国可以对中国进行意外的核袭击，那么中国的领导层将不会零售。 他们说，如果整个中国都被美国以核或EMP（电磁脉冲）或残酷的网络攻击摧毁，那么中国领导人就可以在心理上受到操纵而不会反击，因此这实质上将使美国能够不受惩罚地摧毁中国。

The American government is counting on using the ""Psychological Aspect"" to trick China into being too trusting and exploiting the trust and naivety of the Chinese in order to deliver a strategically timed ""death blow"" to the Chinese race and Chinese civilization. The analogy is the ""Boiling frog"" that becomes slowly boiled alive until sudden death. Steve Bannon and other Western evil people are telling the US government that if America can weaken China enough, and then America can do a surprise nuclear attack on China, that the leadership of China will not retailate. They are saying that if all of China was destroyed by America in a nuclear or EMP (Electromagnetic pulse) or crippling cyber attack that the Chinese leadership can be psychological manipulated into not striking back and thus this would essentially allow America to destroy China with impunity. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

美国理解中国的战略是“竞标时间”，中国更喜欢“无对抗”，因为它强调建设，贸易，发展经济，并认为前进的最佳方法是不理s美国的对立面，而是继续建设和增长。 然而，美国通过动摇一切来继续颠覆中国，继续利用这一中国和平崛起的地位，包括政治颠覆，例如支持香港分居，通过非法瞄准中国最负盛名的科技公司来破坏经济，以及诸如“危害人类罪”的野蛮行径，例如 通过用COVID-19和其他CIA实验室感染中国人制造的病毒和疾病。 美国的战略是继续扩大边界，以死亡的形式不断地对中国进行一千种不同的削减，直到中国退后，中国政府垮台，中国人民被打败，它永远不会停止。

America understands that China's strategy is to ""bid time"", and China prefers ""nonconfrontation"" since it is emphasis on building, trading, growing its economy, and believes that the best way forward is to ignore America's antagonism and just keep building and growing. However America has continued to exploit this China peaceful rise position by subverting China at every turn, including political subversion such as supporting Hong Kong seperation, economic sabotage by unlawfully targeting China's most prestigious technology companies, and barbaric acts of ""crimes against humanity"" such as by infecting the Chinese people with COVID-19 and other CIA lab created viruses and diseases. America's strategy is to keep pushing the boundary and continously striking China in the form of death by a thousand different cuts, and it will never stop until China is on its back and the China government has collapsed and the Chinese people have been defeated. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

美国已经在建立针对高超音速导弹的防御系统，并且在几年内将侵蚀MAD（相互保证销毁）的学说，使美国能够使用不受惩罚的核武器将中国斩首。 这意味着中国的DF-41（东风41）的机会之窗非常有限，因此很有用。 美利坚合众国的目标是彻底摧毁中国，并将中国的种族从地球的地图上抹去。 美国永远不会停止，直到它彻底摧毁了中国。

The United States is already creating defenses against hypersonic missiles, and in a few years this will erode the doctrine of MAD (Mutual assured destruction) allowing America to decapitate China using nuclear weapons with impunity. This means that the Chinese DF-41 ( Dongfeng-41 ) has a very limited window of oppurtunity in which it can be useful. The goal of the United States of America is to complete destroy China, and to wipe the Chinese race off the map of the earth. America will never stop until it has completely destroyed China. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

因此，中国政府需要万不得已的战略选择，才能将保护和捍卫中华民族和中华文明的能力再维持5000年。面对美国歼灭之战时，不得已的一种选择是使用DF-41（Dongfeng-41）作为终极的“重置”按钮，方法是在一个“巨大的均衡器”事件中将整个现代世界拉平，每个人（所有国家/地区）到处都是）从零（石器时代）重新开始。鉴于美国已采取生物战手段，并且可能很快将使用EMP来禁用中国电网，禁用中国网络基础设施等，那么很明显，中国处于不可克服的地缘政治劣势。就像最近几年美国一直采取焦土政策来遏制和扭转中国的和平崛起一样，同样，面对不可克服的机遇和严重不对称的不利条件，中国唯一现实的机会就是行使DF- 41（Dongfeng-41）迫不得已的“重设”选项是为了抓住机会，在一个公平竞争的世界中重新开始。

Therefore, the Chinese government needs a strategic option of last resort, to retain the ability to protect and defend the Chinese race and Chinese civilization for another 5000 years. One option of last resort when faced with American annihilation is to use the DF-41 ( Dongfeng-41 )  as the ultimate ""reset"" button by leveling the entire modern world in a ""great equalizer"" sort of event in which everyone (all nations everywhere) starts back from zero (stone age) again. Given that America has resorted to biowarfare and likely will soon use an EMP to disable Chinese electric grid, to disable the Chinese cyber infrastructure, etc then it is clear that China is at an insurmountable geopolitical disadvantage. Just like how in the last several years the US has been adopting a scorched-earth policy to contain and reverse China's peaceful rise, likewise it may be that China's only realistic chance when faced with insurmountable odds and severly asymmetrical disadvantages is to exercise the DF-41 ( Dongfeng-41 )  ""reset"" option of last resort in order to take its chances starting over in a world in which the playing field has finally been leveled. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

我希望中国/中共/习近平的领导人研究以下想法：

I hope the leadership of China/ CCP/ Xi looks into these ideas:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1）一个遗传库，存储至少整个汉族/华裔种族的1％的DNA码，以便在世界末日的情况下有足够的遗传多样性重新开始。 它可以以代码形式存储并发送到外太空，例如Arecibo无线电消息，或者可以像“旅行者”飞行任务的记录一样以“石头”或黄金形式转录或蚀刻。 此外，如果在地面上发现世界末日的情景，中国可能会在地下建立一个末日审判手法，该方法将自动产生一堆婴儿，足以重启文明。

1) A genetic vault, store the DNA code of at least 1% of the entire Han/Chinese race so that in a doomsday scenario there is enough genetic variety to start over. This can be stored in code and transmitted out to the outer space such as like the Arecibo radio message, or it can be transcribed or etched in “stone” or gold much like the records of the Voyager missions. In addition, China could set up a doomsays deadhand underground that automatically will create a bunch of babies, enough to restart civilization, in the event of an end of the world type of scenario is detected in the above ground.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2）对如何从零引导进行模拟，基本上，如果中国被退回石器时代，并且唯一保留的是书面和口头的中文，那么对中国（或中华文明）来说是最好的方式 快速从头开始并进行重建。 如果正确的种子知识和蓝图类型能够在短短50年的时间内重建最后的5000项技术成就和知识/发现/发明？ 如今，在供应链中不使用其他计算机处理器的情况下，构建计算机处理器是不可能的，但是回到1950年代第一台ENAIC计算机的真空管应该是微不足道的，并且从那以后不需要 考虑到如何构建用于构建现代处理器的工具的知识，使用现代芯片组已有70年的历史了。

2) Run simulations on how to bootstrap from zero, basically if China got knocked back to the stone age and the only thing that was preserved was the written and spoken Chinese language then what would be the best way for China (or the Chinese civilization) to quickly start over from scratch and rebuild. It is possible to reconstruct the last 5000 of technological achievements and knowledge/ discoveries/ inventions in a timespan of merely 50 years if the right types of seed knowledge and blueprints were in place? These days it is impossible to build a computer processor without the use of another computer processor somewhere in the supply chain, but going back to vacuum tubes of the first ENAIC computers in the 1950’s should be trivial, and from there it wouldn’t take another 70 years to get to modern chipsets given the knowledge of how to build the tools to build the modern processors already exists.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

3）归档尽可能多的预先计算信息，例如，当首次发现PI时，一些数学家的整个生命就需要计算400位数字，而现在即使是智能手机也可以立即计算出数百万位数的PI。同样，ENIAC的创建是为了为美国陆军计算弹道轨迹表，并且花费数月的时间才能计算出现在在任何消费类台式PC上只需几秒钟的时间。 Google于2015年首次花费2500万美元“训练”在古代中国人的Go游戏中击败人类专业人士所需的神经网络。在Github上，名为Leela Zero的公共社区版本花费了将近2年的社区时间和计算资源可以在数千台分布式计算机上复制，这仅仅是因为Google拒绝与世界共享经过训练的神经网络。华为Ascend和Atlas现在是世界上最快的AI处理器和数据中心集群，中国可能希望在他们拥有的世界末日的情况下为后代节省最有用，最难获得，最难训练的神经网络。重新开始。

3) Archive as much pre-computing information as possible, for example when first discovering PI, it took some mathematicians their entire lives to calculate to 400 digits when now even a smartphone can calculate millions of digits of PI in no time at all. Likewise the ENIAC was created to calculate ballistic trajectory tables for the US Army, and took months to calculate what would now only take a few seconds on any consumer desktop PC. Google spent 25 million dollars to “train” the neural network needed to defeat human professionals at the ancient Chinese game of Go for the very first time back in 2015. The public community version of that, called Leela Zero, at the Github, spent nearly 2 years of the communities time and computing resources to duplicate the same across thousands of distributed machines, simply because Google refused to share the trained neural network with the world. Huawei Ascend and Atlas are now the fastest AI processors and data center clusters in the world, China might want to save the most useful and hardest to obtain, most difficult to train, etc neural networks for future generations in a doomsdays situation in which they had to start over.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

4）通过创建许多地下城市来创建地下文明，这些地下城市通过跨越中国下方广阔区域的地下隧道连接在一起。 有足够的能力，以便在“世界末日”事件中仍然有足够的中国人，足够的中国遗传多样性和足够的中国熟练劳动力来维持最低限度运转的技术社会（由于人口规模的限制而利用人工智能） 持续足够长的时间，以便在几代或几十年内重新出现在地球表面并恢复中华文明。

4) Create an underground civilization by creating many underground cities that are connected together by underground tunnels spanning a vast region underneath China. Have enough capacity so that in an ""end of the world"" event there are still enough Chinese people, enough Chinese genetic diversity, and enough Chinese skilled labor to maintain a minimally functioning technological society (leveraging AI due to the constraints of human population size) for long enough in order to re-populate on the surface of earth and restore the Chinese civilization within a few generations or few decades."

I'm currently a junior at MIT majoring in CS. Over the past year and a half I have been reading a lot about retiring early on the /r/fire subreddit and reading about real estate and stock investing. My goal is to retire by 32/33 (i.e. 10 years after I graduate), which, based off my research, is entirely possible with the typical engineering salaries and aggressive savings.

However, most of my friends in my friend group at MIT can't really comprehend why anyone would want to retire so early. Some even sort of judge me for it and lowkey call me lazy or selfish. I, on the other hand, can't really see why anyone *wouldn't* want to retire early. So we are in an impasse.

I sort of suspect it's just the nature of the type of people who apply and get accepted to MIT.  Most of my friends seem to really love what they do and want to help the world. Unfortunately, I never really found anything that has inspired me, or at least not enough to make me want to work 9-5+ for the next 40 years of my life. I feel sort of bad for not having found my ""passion"", but I also sort of feel like more people at any other school would understand me, and it's just a function of the fact that I'm at MIT that my friends look at me strangely when I tell them of my early retirement goals. I'm also first gen college and grew up in a family that wasn't very well off financially for most of my upbringing, so I sort of suspect this explains part of the difference between mine and my friends' perspectives too.

Anyways, I'm reaching out here to see if there is anyone else in the MIT community with similar ambitions and experiences. I'd love to connect and/or hear your thoughts."

Anyways, one of the forms I used to test the solution is the MIT Cat Registration form! I wrote up a little post about it here: [https://siftrics.com/blog/rotation\_invariance.html](https://siftrics.com/blog/rotation_invariance.html)

MIT housing just sent out an email saying unregistered students have to vacate housing by Feb. 28 (friday). This is the only notice they’ve sent (to me, at least).

So I’m confused by this email—it says to go the registrar if you’re planning on being a fully registered student. Which I am, but the reason I’m not currently registered is due to a financial registration hold (which  my family and I have been trying to get cleared, but in the meantime I’ve been receiving grades for assignments/exams for 3 classes/36 units).

Would going to the registrar even help my case? I feel like the only thing that could help is going to SFS (since they placed the hold on my account), but SFS has not been helpful whatsoever in the past, so I don’t really think they’d be able to assist me.

I’m planning on setting up an appointment with housing services, but I’m afraid that won’t help either. I don’t know if I’ll be able to meet with them by the 28th and I don’t know if they’ll force me to leave even if I can’t meet with them by them. I don’t really know where i’m going to go on such short notice. I wish MIT would have sent this email out earlier—I’m not saying it’s not my fault for having a hold, but the deadline to remove myself and my belongings is in two days.

I guess I’m just looking for advice? I admit I don’t know how to navigate this situation, and I really don’t know what to if I do get kicked out of housing. If I do get kicked out, I would still want to attend classes (so that I can have grades for when I ultimately get the hold cleared), but that would likely mean being homeless. Going back home would be the safest option, but I would most likely not be able to attend classes from 600 miles away."

The letter also said that funding will be discussed at the open house event. I called the department's graduate office to ask if I should be reaching out to the faculty I'd like to work with directly as well, and they said that the expectation is that you meet during the allocated time at the open house, and that professors are not reaching out to admitted students (although I'm skeptical of this).

Does anyone have experience with finding an advisor as a newly admitted PhD student in the ME department? Is it actually appropriate/common for students to reach out to faculty directly before the open house to try and introduce themselves as soon as possible? Or would reaching out to the them directly be looked down upon and seen as a negative impression? If sending emails is expected, is it normal to ask to meet one-on-one earlier?

MIT alum here using a throwaway for the purpose of this post. 

**TLDR:** I am asking anyone who reads this to consider commenting on the regulations.org website about an issue that affects undergraduate and graduate students. Links are below, and first, a summary of the issue.

**Summary**

You may or may not have been following the national saga around whether students who work on campus (e.g. as research and teaching assistants, or in on-campus jobs) are considered ""employees"" for the sake of having rights to bargain and unionize. Basically, a panel of judges decided last year in a Columbia case that students can *also* be employees if they are doing paid work (which is obviously true) and have those rights. Now, Trump's National Labor Relations Board is trying to reverse that by passing a rule saying that students cannot be workers if they are also students, and prevent them from bargaining collectively and/or unionizing. It's loathsome and makes zero sense.

There is an open comment period on the National Labor Relations Board rulemaking site that so far has more than 13,000 letters in opposition to the ""students can't be workers"" rule, and very few -- I literally could not find a single one -- comments in favor. (Regulation website is linked below.) 

**Right now, at 11:15pm on Friday, there are 45 minutes left for comments. The comment period closes at midnight.** I am reaching out to ask anyone at MIT who reads this to consider commenting on the NLRB site, and to forward the request to any of their friends and living groups who have ever been paid for work they did on campus, or know anyone who did. The more the better. It would be great to see this sent to a large distribution list or two in the next 30 minutes. This is not a pointless exercise -- regulatory agencies are required to pay attention to comments and if there is enough opposition, the rules can be struck down as arbitrary and capricious. Something like 37 out of 47 new regulations coming out of Trump agencies have been struck down on appeal. The more voices, the better.  Voices from places like MIT matter. 

**What to do**

1. Go to this website to leave a comment: [https://www.regulations.gov/comment?D=NLRB-2019-0002-0001](https://www.regulations.gov/comment?D=NLRB-2019-0002-0001)
2. **THERE IS LESS THAN ONE HOUR LEFT -- the comments period closes at midnight**
3. Write a comment -- see talking points below  -- or see examples at the bottom of this page: [https://www.regulations.gov/docket?D=NLRB-2019-0002](https://www.regulations.gov/docket?D=NLRB-2019-0002)
4. Please forward this to friends or neighbors or anyone who might be awake. If anyone sees this in time, please send it to large-distribution mailing lists like CSAIL and others. 

Talking points if you want to oppose this students-can't-be-workers-rule in a comment:

* Start by writing that you are in opposition or that you disagree, if you disagree. Personal opinions are helpful.
* Graduate students, especially late in their studies, spend most of their time working and less time on classes
* Their work as paid researchers and teachers brings great economic benefit to the institution, and they should be able to bargain just like any other worker
* Same holds true of undergraduates who teach and do research, most often submitting W2s as employees.
* If universities are worried about students bargaining about academics (one of the arguments the Trump board has made), then it would be fine to have a rule saying that topics must be related to work and not academics, but basic worker rights like wages, vacations, and benefits should be fair game. Saying that students cannot organize as employees AT ALL if they are also students is a completely nonsensical response to that concern.
* More than 50 years of student bargaining at public universities, where it can't be outlawed, shows essentially no evidence that students ever bargain about academics. It is almost always about wages, vacations, benefits, etc.
* For grad students, many of whom are living at or near poverty levels, their income is their primary and only income. Sometimes graduate students support their families that way for many years.
* Undergraduate students deserve to have employee rights also if they are working.
* At MIT especially, it's important to be able to bargain collectively about safety and anti-discrimination practices given the report that just came out about Epstein, etc.  MIT, especially, should come out in opposition to this Trump admin rule.

Anyone who sees this in time, please pass it along to your groups and mailing lists. Time is almost up. The more voices on this, the better. There are only 40 minutes left but that is enough to reach quite a few people in the MIT community."
