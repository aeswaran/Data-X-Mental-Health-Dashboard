cyel2b,Why don't people complain about the gentrification of IV?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/cyel2b/why_dont_people_complain_about_the_gentrification/,SeniorGaucho,75,2019-09-01 12:46:34,90,/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/cyel2b/why_dont_people_complain_about_the_gentrification/,NaN,"The other day I was talking to my barber who was born and raised in IV. He was raised by Mexican immigrants in a low income household. Him and his family had to move out a few years ago because it was too expensive to live in IV any longer. 


I did some research on Wikipedia and found this quote as well, to add to the timeline:


&gt;Starting in the 1970s, Isla Vista became more and more dominated by students from UCSB and nearby Santa Barbara City College. As UCSB grew and expanded its enrollment, the economic power of the relatively affluent students drove non-student residents out. The late 1960s upheaval destroyed a raft of organized activities that once occupied students' time, and into the void a free-form party scene took hold, resulting in throngs of young people gathering on Friday and Saturday nights on Del Playa Drive, the street that hugs the southern blufftop of Isla Vista.


So basically low income native Isla Vista residents were kicked out of Isla Vista so that upper middle class kids could have a dedicated place to party. SBCC students are arguably the worst, since they don't even have the excuse of it being so close by.


I know that UCSB is a very liberal school, and many people here have problems with gentrification in cities like Los Angeles and Brooklyn, but I find it ironic/hypocritical that they are part of the problem pricing out actual Isla Vista/Goleta natives."

Can I cancel now and line up housing for fall in IV, just in case I don't get placed in any of the res halls that I preferred, or should I just keep the contract and try to find someone who's willing to be reassigned into Trop? 

I'd preferably like to cancel the contract now so I don't have to live there, and there's a chance that I'll get to stay in a different res hall, and if that falls through I can always sublease with someone off-campus."

You beat the odds and got into a good college out of high school? Oh sorry, yeah you’re not done, about that. It’s really amazing how we can never relax isn’t it? We’re always worried about the next step because that’s what is conditioned into us the minute we step in kinder-garden. I went here because i thought this school had the most balanced approach to life. Work hard play hard, but it feels like the play hard is always tarnished because you have a looming beast of pre major gpa requirements. Also the clock is ticking. Every time you mess up that is just one more quarter to be spent here. one more year of stress,  and $$$$ before we can arrive into a much worse and unforgiving world that will prolly be in an economic recession when we graduate.

This would allow students going into their first year to know exactly what to take and when in order to increase the overall graduation rate while allowing students to maximize what they get out of the university academically. Going into UCSB I found that the scheduling process was overwhelming and I ended up taking classes that either fulfilled a single GE when I could have been taking courses that fulfilled multiple or the effort to map out being a double major was too much.

My math foundation is (was?) bad. Eight months ago I was in developmental algebra. After a few units of algebra review, I passed in one semester and then shortly following I somehow got an A (90.2) in my summer precalculus &amp; trig class. I just started calculus and feel a little burnt out. I'm worried I'm climbing the math ladder way too fast and am missing important concepts and will suffer. Should I be worried?

Another question i had was if i actually had to send a physical check in every month since it says to make checks payable to UC REGENTS. This seems like a pretty dated system, like shouldn't I just be able to pay in installments straight from BARC without going through all of this?

I still plan on rushing but I will under no circumstances consume copious amounts of alcohol (getting drunk is a sin homie) and my parents as well as my pastor will be checking in on me daily during rush to ensure that I do not fall victim to any promiscuity.

I will also not engage in any behavior that could be misconstrued as homo-erotic. I have heard tales of a common fraternity hazing practice known as the “elephant walk” where pledges are forced to hold hands and talk about how much sex they have (gross!). I understand that homosexual relationships are something that happens in today’s society (Yea I’m progressive, sue me) however I do fear that my participation in any of these activities will secure myself a spot in the Devil’s fiery below. 

And while we’re on the subject, I am a firm believer in abstinence before marriage. I do fear, however, that access to parties combined with my intense sexual appeal will lead me to perform lewd acts on a (consenting) female. I wish to save my voracious sexual appetite for a godly woman who loves me for who I am: ***a master of slangin’ it.***                         Will joining Greek life put me in a position to compromise the sanctity of my future marriage?

The fraternities I am considering rushing are Sig Pi, Sig Ep, ATO, and ZBT (Not DTD, wack).

This isn't a rant, I'm posting this because the only thing I got out of suffering through that class was learning how poorly designed it was, and I want to put that knowledge to use and warn you guys.

I'll start with the grading: there is a paper based on a book of our choice out of texts we have to read and is worth 70% of your grade, with the intro draft being 10%, first version being 25%, final version being 35%, and class discussion is based around spontaneous debates between classmates surrounding ambiguous concepts. There was minimal in-depth analysis of the texts we read, and I personally got no useful info from class time that would help with my paper. I've gone to office hours, but was just asked questions to ""guide my thinking"" as oppose to receiving some clarity on the text I was working with, which would've really helped. There was very poor communication of expectations, which resulted in a lot of people receiving very poor grades on the intro draft, a good amount of those people being English majors, and I believe only 1 person out of the entire class got an A. I did learn a lot of things from having to analyze the text I chose, but I don't credit that to the class because I did everything on my own, which was pretty difficult and tedious.

I've gotten Bs in classes, and I have never blamed anything but that I didn't put enough effort into them. But this class was an exception, and the only thing that was fair game was my ability to change it to P/NP, but my dumbass decided against. Don't let me have sacrificed in vain brothers and sisters, heed my warning and avoid this class and the one who taught it. I genuinely feel like it's the worst class I've ever taken at UCSB."

I called up finaid since my Cal Grant A wasn't showing up on BARC and finaid said to just hold tight and wait for it to kick in. I was already given a deadline extension to pay off my tuition and such, and I have it paid off with just loans (Parent PLUS and direct), still waiting for Cal Grant.

I acknowledge the fact that I will be refunded whatever loans are left over after my Cal Grant is officially dispersed in BARC, however, since I am dorming at Tropicana Del Norte (TDN), my housing payment process in general is different than a dorm within UCSB (from what I understand). I am required to have $0 balance for TDN by the 22nd for move-in, and overall payment deadline is October 1st. 

My situation is that I am relying on most of my PLUS loan to pay off housing, however it's currently being used to pay off my tuition and other fees due to the late Cal Grant. I'm not sure what to do, but I was thinking of contacting the front desk at TDN. Any advice is greatly appreciated, thanks!"

I'm just wondering if it's even worth applying and paying $70 for them to look at my app and be like ""hell no"".

So here are my stats:
4.15 weighted HS GPA
3.56 unweighted HS GPA :/
I'm a white female, not much leverage there
SAT:1370 (I'm signed up to take it again in early November, but will I get higher? Idk man)

ECs: Science Olympiad all 4 years, piano lessons for 10 years, Sac County Moot Court 11th and 12th, president(and I started) of the ""Classical Music Appreciation Club"", part of CSF and NHS. Junior rep for CSF junior year. I got an award from my APUSH teacher for history at award night. Got a ""best speaker"" award from the Sac County Moot Court thingie.

Also, this summer I did a ""Preceptorship"" at a local hospital, Kasier Permanente. I have over 76 hours of shadowing doctors, nurses, techs, and MAs in the field. 

I've taken AP when possible, but we only have so many at my school. Here are the ones I've taken so far and my scores. 

AP Biology: 5
AP Physics 1: 3 (by the skin of my teeth)
APLAC: 4
AP Calc AB:  3
AP US History: 5
This senior year, I'm taking AP Psych, AP Stats, AP Lit, AP 3d Art, and AP Japanese, and Honors Physio.

Again, I'm sorry if this is the wrong thread. I'm just very lost with so many UCs and CSUs to apply to, I don't think UCSB will say yes, but I'd like some others' opinions.

Thank you so much!"

But I don't want to miss out on bonding that happens even before those club meetings/concerts/etc. So when I introduce myself to the people around me, do I let it go and see if we continue to meet naturally? And if not, assuming I like this person/group and want to make sure we hang out again, how do I make that happen? (ESPECIALLY without seeming desperate or over-eager. There was one guy like that at my summer job and it was a total [social] turn-off.)"

As the 1st week of Fall Quarter is about to begin I wanted to invite you all to our welcome back party to kick off the school year. 

The reason for this event is because my partner and I want to fund our education. Although I have attended UCSB for about 2 years, I am not scheduled to return at all due to financial reasons. And I'd like to fight my current position to the best of my ability. My partner also has his own motives which he plans to use for education.

Some more information about me is that I am an environmental studies major and heavily influenced by the education I have received here at this institution. That being said, for the past \~2 years I have been raising capital for some of the world's most pressing issues, some current, but the most important being long-term. And there is strategy to combating what will be impacting us, future leaders, great builders, and most necessary doers. 

We ask that you come out this Friday to:

1) Have a great time and,

2) Help funnel long-term funds to the world's most pressing issues

&amp;#x200B;

If you plan on purchasing a pre-sale ticket please contact me and either I can personally visit you or we can do everything digitally.

Just some background on me: I was accepted to numerous Ivy’s but I was unable to go because they messed up my application and I had to settle for UCSB, so some would say I'm over-qualified to be here. You can call me a cc transfer but I promise you I'm different. 

I was also very accomplished in High School, where I earned mostly A’s and B’s (I got a C+ once in Precalc but it’s only because my teacher hated me, not sure why). Even in conversation people will often admire my extensive vocabulary when I use words like “certainly”, “unorthodox”, and “danger”. 

My intellect is clearly one of a kind, however I do worry that the party animal inside of me could hinder my success in the classroom. 

I'm already a pretty crazy partier as it stands (I smoke weed). I also once had six beers at my grandma’s 75th birthday party and no one noticed, and in my hometown I’m widely known as the Lou Gehrig of partying (B/c I have a disease named after me)

I’m telling this to you to accentuate the point that I’m ready to go all out in these next two years, but I also don’t want to jeopardize my future. I’m aware of how the corporate world works because my Dad works for an up-and-coming tech company in Palo Alto, and I know that any mistakes made academically or socially during college can limit job opportunities. I think I’ll be fine because a family friend is hooking me up with an internship next summer at Morgan Stanley (ya know, the Big 4), but with an outlaw like me you never know when trouble might strike. 

If anyone can offer their perspective on managing time socially as well as academically that would be greatly appreciated."

If someone breaks into my house then I’m a victim 100%. If I go to a party and compromise myself with alcohol then I must accept partly the responsibility if something bad happens to me. Being drunk is not an excuse for not taking responsibility for actions/in actions. Too much alcohol mixed with young people with hormones going bezerk, mixed with ""rape culture"" mixed with parents who dont' talk about sex to their kids mixed with no supervision can lead to not so great stuff happening. Consequences happen, good and bad, from your decisions. It's not a punishment, it just is, right or wrong. Keep yourself out of danger. If a person can't handle the alcohol then don't drink alcohol. People prey on drunk women all the time so don't allow yourself to become a drunk victim. The reality is, in this world we live in, if you get so drunk that you pass out, you put yourself in a very vulnerable position to be robbed, beaten, killed or raped, be u man or woman. When two people are both blacked out drunk, whether a ""rape"" occurred (and by whom) is nothing more than an after-the-fact interpretation of events. Once you decide to use any drugs which inhibit your capacity to make sound decisions, you must accept that you could end up in a dicey situation. Plenty of people have later been charged with DWI or become pregnant by ignoring this reality. Getting drunk and having regrettable sex is not a reason to cry rape. 
It’s not a punishment, it’s a consequence. Personal responsibility goes a long ways. It is your responsibility to make sure you are in control of yourself at all times. Simply have sex that you can remember. We all have to be careful and responsible about where we go, what we do and who we hang out with, just one bad incident can change your whole life and make it much worse or even end it."

On the other hand UCSB has been my dream school for as long as I can remember primarily due to the Physics program. My girlfriend recently told me to apply as a transfer as the acceptance rate is decently high for transfer students. However I have read that most transfers are from community colleges rather than other 4 year schools. So my question is if it would be worth it, or even feasible to apply as a transfer from UCI based on my situation and if so what are my chances, if I keep a good GPA for the next year and get involved."

I graduated 2 years ago. I managed to get my the deactivation postponed by 1 year because I was still involved with research projects on campus. But now I’ve been informed that my UCSB e-mail account will be deactivated and there are no more extensions I can get. 

The title really says it all. Even as UC tuition has reached an all time high, apparently UCSB can’t afford to give its alumni an e-mail address. 

I know that many of us have other online accounts (such as Amazon or Faceook) that are tied to our umail accounts. Looking through thousands of emails to try and find the various accounts you have tied to your umail is a tediously annoying task, to say the list. If you’re new to UCSB - please take this piece of advice: never register any account with your umail address. 

Almost every single private university in the country allows their students to keep their e-mail accounts forever. It’s a good policy - it fosters alumni loyalty. It’s also beneficial for applying to jobs - employers prefer seeing .edu e-mail addresses. 

It seems that UCSB would rather pinch pennies than foster long-lasting alumni relationships. Such policies all but ensure that alumni will be reluctant to donate back to the school that charged them tens of thousands in tuition while failing to provide basic services such as adequate space in classes, permanent e-mail addresses, etc.

However I feel weird and guilty, and embarrassed. I don't use a wheelchair or have a physical disability or anything, don't other people have more reason? I feel like I can't explain why I need help without being embarrassed or feeling like I shouldn't be taken seriously.

If I didn't use any services I would take another leave of absence or fail out of school and I feel like I should just fail out of school tbh. 

I'm also embarrassed because in smaller classrooms it's gonna be obvious when I test separately or if someone is taking notes for me then I might be sitting nearby them and I'll feel hella judged because I am able to take notes it's just impossible for me to keep up with the professor while writing down things because I can't focus on both and reading the board but then like ughh...I could really try but it's hard it's not like I can't hear or write..."

Our lab has currently started a paid human-subject study (thus we are not allowed to use subject pools) and we are looking into more ways to get the study's information out to the public.

For people who actively participate in research, where are the kinds of places you look to find new studies?

For people who do not actively participate, what kinds of locations do you think could grab your attention and lead you to sign up to be a participant in a paid study?

We have already posted information on the OSL kiosks around campus, other suggestions would be appreciated if any, thanks!"

Delta Epsilon Mu is the Nation's Premier Professional Co-Ed Pre-Health Fraternity and the ONLY pre-health, co-ed fraternity at UCSB. We were recently established in June 2019 and now are recruiting for our Alpha Class! 

Our founders decided to establish Delta Epsilon Mu specifically at UCSB because we were fully aware that there is a lack of pre-health options and opportunities at UCSB (note: there is a major difference between being Pre-med and Pre-health!) DEM was created in order to develop an inclusive and comfortable environment for individuals who are struggling with their future career path in healthcare. We strive to give Pre-Health students at UCSB a voice and be an asset for students to figure out what fits with their goals and aspirations by bringing awareness to students that there is a wide range of options within a Pre-Health route. 

If you have any questions or would like to learn more about us as a Chapter and our members, please join us at our Recruitment Week events. You are more than welcome to message us! :)

It’s come to a point where my heart starts beating really fast and It gets hard to breathe. I was wondering if I could potentially get help from somewhere? Either pills or therapy?? If so, where would I seek this help? Like does CAPs help with this or would I have to go to student health?  I’ve tried earplugs but the root of the problem is I have a fear of others making noise while I’m trying to sleep. Thanks for listening to my ted talk lmao"

While there is the obvious danger of a barefooter's toes being stepped on by shoed feet, I am sure we can find common ground between us. However, people with particularly pungent feet or athletes foot will not be allowed to participate. We want to keep the reputation of barefooters clean!

I have not heard anything events they are hosting nor were they hosting tables during week 0, they’re facebook page is dead(last post in 2016).

I joined one of the CSA WeChat groups  but the gc is dead and it doesn’t seem like they have a lot of involvement with Chinese Americans.

Why does it decide to just stop working at random times of the day? 

It makes no sense and it makes studying a lot more annoying. Like right now my phone just refuses to connect to it and neither does my computer so I guess I am done studying for the night. Makes no sense.

Not sure what it would take but there’s got to be other WiFi options for the school. I was at Colorado State University for a while and their internet worked all the time.

I'm a gaucho myself and I'm currently on my semester abroad in Sweden, but I have a friend here who is wanting to study abroad in CA and is stoked on UCSB! She hasn't applied yet and therefore hasn't been accepted but I've been trying to help her figure out the process, and the main issue is housing. For reference, she'd be staying the whole year, Fall 2020 to Spring 2021.

I told her about possible subleasers, but we were wondering if it would be more convenient to find a permanent place for the whole year instead of swapping houses/subleases each quarter. I also told her to check out the Free&amp; For Sale page on Facebook for this as well.

She could possibly try and join a full lease with some people, but we weren't sure if that would be possible, as she'd still be in Sweden during the time where you'd normally be signing a lease, so I'm not sure how feasible that would be.

There's also student apartments, but I know nothing about those, so if any of you know anything I'd appreciate the info. Same goes for the housing cooperatives, I know nothing.

Are there any other options I'm forgetting? I think she'd prefer to live in Isla Vista than Goleta proper but I'm sure that's an option too.

Thanks in advance!"

I’m a reporter at Business Insider and I’m reaching out because I’m working on a project right now that I thought could be of interest to y’all. We are reaching out to students all around the world to see what a day in the life is like for students at different schools. This week, we’re focusing on UC Santa Barbara. 

The project would involve **taking 15 to 20 photos of your life at Santa Barbara** and submitting them, along with brief descriptions.

Are you a student doing something unusual that you think more people should know about? Do you know of any hidden gems or strange places on campus that deserve more attention? Do you often find yourself caught in funny or unexpected situations? Do you know of any scandals or bad behavior on campus? Are you a regular at some of the school's wildest parties? Are you an elite athelete? If you can answer yes to any of these, we’d love to hear from you.

Please reach out if you have a compelling story idea about college that you think could be told through a photo series. We are **offering $160 to anyone we decide to publish** and we are open to keeping these anonymous if necessary. Hope to hear from y’all. Thanks!

(Please email or text me if you’re interested)

So here's the deal, fellow Redditors. I recently joined the amazing Ombuds office. As I started out, I joined a meeting to promote International Ombuds Day. I got this idea to join forces with UCSB Recreation and their Campus Challenge event that seeks to recognize UCSB as one of the greatest outdoor schools. The idea I hatched was to have an outdoor event to both win points for the outdoor challenge and promote the special work we do for students, staff, and faculty as your confidential Ombuds.  I am hosting a camp-coffee brew-up at Goleta Beach starting at 7AM tomorrow. I'll fire up a camp stove and grind and brew coffee. The event will take place on the last table at Goleta Beach -- the one nearest to UCSB. The only way to access the event until 8AM is via bicycle, skateboard, or on foot. 

Perhaps I got a little too, well, specialized with this event. But I know there are people out there who are into the #CoffeeOutside lifestyle. It's darn fun to create an experience that incorporates some fo the best elements of backpacking and bikepacking. 

If you're out there, coffee and bike people, join me. I'll have coffee to share but if you are looking for an excuse to fire up your camp-cooking kit, bring your kitchen with you. Others should bring a mug or cup. 

Just like the Ombuds office, this event is open to all. 

Don

p.s. if you are the mountain lion, you are only invited if you behave and don't drink all the coffee."

It really sucks losing all my close friends cause of college changes, and after attending all my classes and clubs I've met some cool people but don't see myself with a real group of friends.

Having depression and anxiety doesn't really help, but I've been doing my best at making friends, but it doesn't seem too likely that I'm going to meet any close friends or a group of friends.

Another really big thing for me was the idea of being in a meaningful fufilling relationship, and I know that will take time but that is a big priority for me.

The ~new~ Intersectional Feminists org on campus is starting a Menstrual Products drive this week/next week to combat period poverty. What is period poverty you may ask? It is the fact that not everyone has access to menstrual hygiene products due to cost and stigmas! In a city-wide study on period poverty it was found that 46% of womxn had to choose between a meal and period products. But it is a global issue and menstrual hygiene is a RIGHT! Period poverty affects ALL GENDERS. 

Since Oct. 19th is National Period day, we will be collecting  menstrual hygienic products in front of the arbor. (UNUSED). Tuesday from 9-3PM and Thursday from 9-1PM. We will then be giving them to local homeless shelters. The dates for next week will be posted on our IG: @intersectfeminists. Thank you and please consider donating or coming by and learning about our org! You'll get a free sticker."

Second year prebio, taking Chem 1C and lab, Physics 6A and lab, intro to bio, ochem, and a 1-unit class for fun. I haven't been mentally in the right place, and although I'm starting to recover, I've already dug myself a hole by falling behind with one or two lectures. This is week 3 but with all the things I'm trying to do, I'm afraid I won't be able to catch up with those lectures, so I was thinking of putting aside 1CL until next quarter, spring, or even summer. It's also at an inconvenient time for me (5 to 9 PM and I *do not* want to put up with that right now, not while I'm still trying to pick myself back up for this quarter). 

I briefly considered Physics, but I actually like how I'm doing in the class right now so I don't want to drop it. The fun class doesn't take up much of my time or energy (it's the class I look forward to most, too), so that's not an option.

It's barely halfway through the month but we're already at the 90% limit and will have to be charged for overage data.

Has this happened to anyone else? I don't know enough about data to know whether or not four people can rack up 1 TB of data usage in 15 days.

To put it simply, people who are certified fuckheads and have a bad reputation are known by the community here. If anyone here is in the know about it, I'd like to know more about how it works. 

This time of the year is especially socially active and everyone is getting to know new people. One of the newer people I've been spending time with is known by the IV community for a particular incident that I did not know about until I mentioned their name to a trusted friend who was aware and told me to immediately cut ties with that individual, as associating with them would cause problems for me.

 Here's what I know about the list:

1. If you are on the list, the community knows exactly who that individual is. Full name, face, who they hang out with, everything. 
2. If that individual is on the list, there is undeniable evidence of what they did. No one gets falsely put on the list.
3. Once an individual is on the list, they are on the list for life. 
4. Being on the list immediately bans you from participating in UCSB and IV culture. That individual will never be allowed into any party, school club, or social activity if they are known. 
5. The list goes beyond Greek life. The word is spread about the individual and people let other people know who they are. So basically what happened to me in my case.  
6. The list is is taken very seriously. In other words, it's not talked about in public. But it is talked about in private. 

I'm not sure this is the right place to ask about it, but every time I try to find out more when speaking to someone about it, I'm not in the circle of trust and get very little information. Even asking about it and mentioning it sort of ""breaks the code"". If anyone could help answer some of my questions, please DM me."

Although BU is a good school, it's dawned upon me that it isn't really the right fit for me at this point, and I'm not having as fun of a college experience as I could be having. UCSB has always been a dream school of mine because of the beautiful campus as well as the party scene. However, I also understand that if I were to transfer schools, I would have to be practical and pick a university that would fit my career interests rather than just prioritizing my social life.

I'm someone who has always been very interested in writing, and my current career goal is to become an editor (of books, not journalism) and author. I haven't done too much research on UCSB's writing program at this point, but I was hoping to get some insight about it from students. Would it be worth it to apply to UCSB as a writer, or does the school not really put a strong focus on that? Any advice would be appreciated!"

Excerpts of the dialogue:

&amp;#x200B;

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi returns to the Porter camera system at 1031 for a check-in. ""Nancy Pelosi is here and she wants $3 billion to keep the border open at Monterrey. $3 billion dollars to keep that shit open do you believe that?"" Matthew Porter commentates. Pelosi states 1034: ""I think he \[Brian Schlenker\] needs to be removed. I think we need to get this guy out of here"". Speaker Pelosi then agrees to call back at 7pm PST. Gigi Hadid at 1034: ""Thanks for calling us. I've got you down for three minutes"". Pelosi don't worry about that I've got 3 billion.  

&amp;#x200B;

1031 Matthew Porter: Nancy Pelosi is on and she wants $3 billion dollars to keep the border open at Monterrey. Three billion dollars to keep that shit open do you believe that?

1033 Nancy Pelosi: I don't think that will be necessary unless you insist.

1033 Donald Reeves?: We insist.

1033 Nancy Pelosi: Ok then I guess we have a deal.

1033 Matthew Porter: Thank you Mrs. Pelosi.

1033 Nancy Pelosi: Please call me Speaker Pelosi.

1033 Nancy Pelosi: We want to make sure you have safe passage at Monterrey.

1033 Matthew Porter: We appreciate that Speaker Pelosi.

1033 Gigi Hadid: I think we may have to scale back a little bit though.

1033 Nancy Pelosi: Gigi I think we'll be just fine.

1035 Nancy Pelosi: God damn it! I want Kamala to get a billion out of yours, not out of mine.

1035 Gigi Hadid: I think we can accommodate you but we need to find out if Monterrey will be open on the 30th of January.

1036 Nancy Pelosi: Of course it will Gigi.

1036 Nancy Pelosi: $3 billion goes a long way Peter.

1036 Peter Thiel: Excellent answer.

1043 Gigi Hadid: I think we need to give Kamala a billion dollars to keep her \[happy\].

1043 Matthew Porter: I think we can do that but we need to get her to do something first.

1043 Gigi Hadid: She did. We got her fucking Rahm Emmanuel Monday morning \[14Jan\] at 235. 

1043 Matthew Porter: Perfect, then we're all set. Send her the billion.

1043? Nancy Pelosi: She'll accept the money, I guarantee it.

1043? Gigi Hadid: Nancy thank you for everything.

&lt;ch4&gt;

1036 Donald Reeves: Don't listen to her. She will close down the border if it's not there. Make sure she gets the $3 billion.

2102 Gigi Hadid: Why the fuck are we giving you five kids DeBlasio?

2102 Bill DeBlasio: Jesus Christ because I asked for them.

2123 Bill DeBlasio rapes and kills his first child of the night.

2123 Bill DeBlasio: I can't believe I killed the little bastard.

2128 ?: Oh God (FBI) Rapinoe is coming down the street (seen in front of 307 Summer headed in the direction of Ashland Avenue Apartments).

2130 Tara: Rapinoe is fuckin furious.

2134 Christopher Porter: A fifth child has died at the hands of Bill DeBlasio.

2134 Matthew Porter: Thing is Bill \[DeBlasio\] didn't even want the fifth one, but he did it anyway because that's how bad he wants to be a part of the Illuminati. 

2135 Bill DeBlasio: \[regarding Illuminati 'ownership' of DeBlasio\] ...seriously, you already owned me with $100 million dollars.

2137 Bill DeBlasio: I think I figured out what you're doing. You want me to go on record saying I killed five kids. But here I am on video so what difference does it make? I killed five kids by raping them. Does that fucking work for you?

2137 Donald Reeves: That'll do Bill thank you.

2138 Bill DeBlasio: Now where is that little minx I'll finish off with her.

2138 Gigi Hadid: So he just fucked five kids and killed them now I have to finish him off?

2138 Patricia Porter: Gigi is gonna finish \[DeBlasio\] off. She has to do that.

I've always knew that I wanted to study abroad my 3rd year, I'm currently conflicted about going one semester or to stay the whole year. If anyone has ever been in the same situation as me, I would love to hear about your experience!  


I'm a sociology major and I was thinking of either going to England or South Korea to study, but I'm leaning more towards SK at the moment. I'm not too worried about the classes as I heard it's do-able, but if you have any insight about classes abroad please share them. I do have some FOMO about leaving home for so long but I love to travel and think that it'd be good for me to venture out of my comfort zone. Some people have gone home for the winter break between fall semester and spring semester so if I was really homesick I would consider doing that too. So the pro's and con's list I've come up with is:  


Pros to staying a year:  
\-longer time to explore the country   
\-more time to travel to neighboring countries (like Japan!!! my dream)  
\-gives me a chance to build longer friendships!   
\-i heard you get more financial aid for full year as opposed to just a semester? i'm not too sure so pls lmk!  
\-classes aren't too difficult since I heard that the classes are toned down for exchange students   
\-food in SK is very YUM !!   


cons to not stay a year:  
\-homesickness?   
\-living in the dorms??   
\-i hate the cold so winter is going to be brutal   


any help is appreciated! thanks!"

I'm currently at a california cc and will be transferring to a UC starting next fall but I don't know which one to go to. I am only applying to UCSB and UCLA, I have a strong belief I will get into both schools and they will both offer me similar financial aid, so the final decision will come down to which I want more. The issue is I've wanted to really experience college for the vast majority of my life, and I know that UCSB will be better for that. Also, I will finally have to move out which is also a big dream of mine. As for UCLA, I know it has a very strong premed program and it would look great to have their name associated with mine, but I don't love any other aspect of it. I don't know what to do, do I try to have fun at UCSB and enjoy the last two years I have before I start the time-consuming journey or medicine, or do I go to a better looking school that could probably open more doors for me (UCLA). Thank you, any and all advice is welcomed :)"

Finding a reason to jump on the anti-greek train from an allegation with 0 evidence so far. Yeah let's take every single rumor as an absolute fact to shit on something you don't agree on. 

Don’t believe everything you’re told, just like the roofie incident. It was never proven that the roofie thing was Greek life related, only the sexual assault counterpart.

I’m not downplaying the importance of sexual assault, it’s definitely a big issue that we as fraternities need to work on. However there are houses here that have 0 misconduct allegations and the rotten few that ruin the image of Greek life doesn’t mean that characteristic applies to every single guys in frats.

Black people statistically commit more crimes in the United States but that doesn’t mean it’s right to treat all of them like criminals. So why are we doing the same with frats?"

To start:
- Fuck the current UCSB Sig Pi chapter.

- Absolutely investigate every and any report of sexual assault.

- Absolutely investigate and take the necessary (hopefully extremely severe) actions against any organizations linked to any case of sexual assault.

- Absolutely keep the public updated on relevant information, including suspect info and any related organizations.

However...

Calls to “ban all frats” and the general demonization of Greek Life is not helpful to solving this issue. In fact, it’s detrimental.

 Blanket statements like this help no one. Fraternities and sororities aren’t going away any time soon, and implying that they are the root cause of sexual assault (on any campus) is at best misguided, and at worst weakens any attempts to actually address the issue.

Addressing the deeply problematic hookup culture that leads to the normalization/fostering of sexual assault in ANY organization  or community is what’s important.

While packed ‘Party towns’ like IV and certain aspects of Greek Life absolutely might amplify the issue, they’re not the cause. Let’s be smart about how we fight this."

But that's a lot of women. Over 2,000 at UCSB alone. This in an epidemic, if it's true. 


But the number they reference is patently poor statistics, determined by an advocacy study (look up the term), and it's totally shameful that a ""world-class research university"" would peddle this delusional falsehood, to the expense of the mental health of the young women attending here. If you don't believe me or want to do the research yourself, [take it from Forbes.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/evangerstmann/2019/01/27/the-stat-that-1-in-5-college-women-are-sexually-assaulted-doesnt-mean-what-you-think-it-means/)


I'm not trying to detract from the recent abhorrent behavior going on here, but instead making the point that SEXUAL ASSAULT IS NOT NORMAL. This is not something that ""just happens"", an everyday thing that 1 in 5 of us will go through as part of our college experience. This is something we must condemn and work together to prevent, and punish those who do to the fullest extent."

A huge resource is the CARE office on campus. There are two locations: one inside the Women’s Center (Student Resource Building) and another in the Gaucho Support Center In Isla Vista. There is also the STESA office (Standing Together to End Sexual Assault) downtown, another great resource in Santa Barbara.

I will be heading to your university for Winter and Spring 2020 quarters. I major in economics and have a background in business management.
I’m wondering if you guys could recommend me any classes which require relatively low commitment when compared to others. I have to take courses which are not first year level, and they have to be somewhat related to economics. I’m currently looking at Feldmans business strategy class - it appears to be very interesting! Can anyone advise if it is particularly challenging or time consuming.
I am willing to work hard when I’m in SB, it’s just I want to be able to get as much out of the experience as possible and having constant work won’t allow me to do that.
Anyways, thanks for taking the time to read my post, I’m excited to meet you guys."

My roommate is impossible to deal with, and she acts like (because she is) a child. It's like living with my little brother again, but I deal with it and make it as comfortable as possible for the both of us while still being cordial to her like a normal person. I'd never hang out with her though. I tried a few times but it felt like I was babysitting a bunch of kids. Not only this, but a lot of them are constantly fishing for validation (mostly my roommate) because they're so insecure, and they think it's attractive or something. For example, my roommate's always asking if X makes her look fat, if she should screw X, complains 24/7 about how she wants to party, get drunk off her ass, and screw random dudes but has to study, what should she do in X situation? And I want to tell her to make her own decisions and stop asking me, and get some better time management skills, because I'm not willing to be her mom so I usually just sleep around the time she and her friends get back so they won't talk to me. It's like I'm constantly surrounded by my brother and his high school friends. They all think I'm a hermit who only speaks rarely and says nonsensical things, but really, I'm a pretty social and active person whenever I'm with people I like, and making friends comes easily to me. It's getting them to stay that doesn't come easy.

Her friend group only brings drama, and it's entirely made up of people from my floor, and she has them over all the time. I cannot even begin to tell you how many problems they have, but at the moment I'm looking for a new group of friends. My plan was to get out and socialize more at the beginning of the term so I wouldn't be stuck only socializing with people from my floor, but I was out of town that week and missed a lot of stuff, and got stuck constantly surrounded by the toxic people on my floor and my roommate. 

I realized a couple weeks ago that I need to find some new people to surround myself with on the regular or else I'll just go through the day being miserable, but after going to CAPs I realize that I need to stop holding things in and be more proactive.

I'm going to a club's fundraiser soon and hopefully I'll meet people there with the same interests as me and who I can relate more with, get to know more upperclassmen and people with equal or more experience than me in general, but if I don't are there any other ways to meet new people here besides just clubs and going out to IV?

I'm not into meme culture or jumping on every single trend, I pretty much stopped caring 5 years ago, I've been playing a lot of switch games, but I have a 3DS, multiple emulators (NES, N64, Gameboy advance), and currently saving up money to build my own PC. Most of my friends from my hometown were like 7 years older than me so I partially developed a music taste from them that my roomate thinks is 'emo' (it's not that emo/hilster/whatever, I just like listening to whatever sounds good) and have had some pretty weird experiences over the years. Also I like exploring rooftops, and high places, and I've been to 6 different countries, 7 in December and love casual travel. I also love coding and am currently obsessed with messing with and learning how to install OSes. I also play DDR and watch anime (mostly 90s and Shounen) but also watch some TV shows and cartoons (lately angsty shows from the 00s, childhood stuff, Rick and Morty, South Park) and currently on an indie movie spree.

Now that I wrote that paragraph, I don't know how confident I should feel about my ability to make friends with similar interests, but it's worth a shot.

As I am typing, my roommate has the same guy over and is currently singing off-key to shitty sad pop music where they lyrics are just guys whose voices all sound the same telling you they love you and self-validation at full volume I can hear it through my headphones which are turned up to the highest volume setting before it goes into the red zone and damages my eardrums. I tell myself it will only get better from here.

This has been cathartic."

KITP had a circus theme. They had a fortune telling booth, knife thrower, and some carnival games. I liked the interactive aspects of their department.


OISS was very immersive. They had a dark jungle / forest theme going on. There was media playing on a TV with creepy atmospheric noise. There was some dry ice going near some mushrooms. There was also a Candy house, Vines and leaves everywhere, and tons of spiderwebs.


A department in HSSB had an Alice in Wonderland theme. Unfortunately I didn't get to see it.

Is that what you're saying? Also, mumble rap's more of a highschooler thing, and pretty sure as a college student it'd be more in-line with another college student than a parent)

Then he went on to say 'Bittorrent might also be a little outdated for you 18 year olds out there, that's soo 2011' (wasn't even that long ago, pretty sure any 18 year old who's at least a bit internet proficient has used Bittorrent at one point)

If you get triggered please just don’t read this. 

“transgenderism” on our campus in the form of changing one’s pronouns to “they/them” has become so common on our campus it has completely invalidated the existence of real, queer people who suffer from actual gender dysphoria. I should be able to say this and not be labeled as a transphobe. Let me explain. 

In order to change your pronouns, one must have a need to do so. Wanting to “wear both men and women’s clothes” or not feeling as masculine or feminine and one thinks they should does not constitute dysphoria. These are social constructions, I don’t give a rats ass about what clothes you decide to wear but the construction of your brain. Dwindling gender dysphoria down to clothes or stereotypes is extremely harmful to the trans community. 

We should be able to have these sorts of conversations without getting labeled as transphobes. There are people out there who literally murder Black trans women for being transgender, those are your transphobes! I and other people on the left and right who question the nuisances of transgenderism aren’t your enemies. People like you who don’t allow diversity of thought are the reason why little scientific research can be done on transgenderism. We can’t even look into this, what’s supposed to be, a mental illness because y’all use it as a fucking political statement and fashion accessory. THIS IS HARMFUL TO ACTUAL TRANS PEOPLE. 

If you recently changed your pronouns to they/them because you wanna be “different” or for the sake of “fun” and you experience no gender dysphoria, fuck you and you are the worst kind of human being."

According to various online stats, the majority ethnicity at each campus differs. The list below cites the majority ethnicity at each campus:

[**UC Riverside: Hispanic**](https://www.ucr.edu/about/facts.html)  
[**UC Merced: Hispanic**](http://www.ucmerced.edu/fast-facts)  
[**UC Santa Cruz: White**](http://diversity.ucsc.edu/diversity/images/student_demo_2014.pdf)  
[**UC Santa Barbara: White**](http://bap.ucsb.edu/institutional.research/common.data.set.2014.15.pdf)  
[**UCLA: Asian**](https://www.admission.ucla.edu/campusprofile.htm)  
[**UC San Diego: Asian**](http://studentresearch.ucsd.edu/_files/stats-data/enroll/ugethnic.pdf)  
[**UC Davis: Asian**](https://www.ucdavis.edu/sites/default/files/upload/files/uc-davis-student-profile.pdf)  
[**UC Berkeley: Asian**](http://opa.berkeley.edu/uc-berkeley-fall-enrollment-data)  
[**UC Irvine: Asian**](http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-ln-ucsb-latino-20150127-story.html)

UC Merced publicly prides itself on having a diverse student body and claims it “proudly serves the most ethnically and culturally diverse student body among all University of California campuses,” its website [**states**](http://www.ucmerced.edu/diversity).

UC Merced’s student ethnic demographics [**show**](http://www.ucmerced.edu/fast-facts) Hispanics make up the lion’s share of the student body at 3,022 students – or 48.5 percent.

Asians and Pacific Islanders come in second at 1,485 students, or 23.8 percent (Middle Eastern students are included in the Asian category if they are U.S. residents). White students place third at 795 students, or 12.7 percent.

📷Next up? “Nonresident aliens,” defined as students who are not U.S. citizens — either undocumented students or international students. There are 333 such students enrolled, or 5.3 percent of the student population.

After that comes 299 African-American students, which makes up 4.8 percent of the student body. The rest are listed as either “two or more races” or Native American, and 1 percent “declined to state.”

About 99 percent of the student body is from California, with only 24 students [**listed**](http://www.ucmerced.edu/fast-facts) as coming from out of state or a foreign country. That would leave 309 as undocumented students – more than the African American student population.

“UC Merced welcomes students of all ethnicities and backgrounds, and we are proud of the support that we provide to the highly qualified, UC-eligible first-generation students from our region and elsewhere who often aren’t exposed to higher education opportunities early on,” campus spokesperson James Leonard said in an email to *The College Fix*.

He added “undocumented students represent all ethnicities and nationalities. We often don’t know how they identify, which makes it difficult to compare that category to others.”

[**RELATED: Tired of Racism Claims, UCLA Student Sets Record Straight**](http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/16312/)

UC Merced also has a “Hispanic-serving institution” designation, handed down by the U.S. Department of Education in 2010. That makes the university eligible for a host of funding and grants from the U.S. departments of Education, Agriculture, and Housing and Urban Development. Interestingly, UC Merced does not offer a major in ethnic studies or Chicano/Latino studies.

[**RELATED: Hispanic High School Grads Outpace White Peers in College Enrollment Rates**](http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/13488/)

In some ways, the student population at UC Merced mirrors California’s demographic trends. Gov. Jerry Brown’s office [**reported**](http://www.ebudget.ca.gov/2014-15/pdf/BudgetSummary/FullBudgetSummary.pdf) in 2014 that statewide Hispanic residents surpassed whites, coming in at 39 percent compared to 38.8 percent, respectively. Asian residents come in at 13 percent, followed by Black residents at 5.8 percent. Multi-race was 2.6 percent, then came Pacific Islander and American Indian at 1 percent apiece.

“As the Hispanic population in California continues to grow, the proportions of the other race groups will decline slightly, except for Asian, which through immigration should sustain its proportion of the population over the next five years,” the governor’s office stated.

When asked whether or not certain ethnic groups at UC Merced appear to be underrepresented, Leonard says “it really depends on the context” and that “our distribution of ethnicities is much more similar to that of the San Joaquin Valley than of California as a whole.”

According to the most recent stats available online, white students are not the most represented demographic at at least six other UC campuses as well, but none of the campuses have such a small percentage of Caucasian students as UC Merced except for UC Riverside, which has a white student population of 15.6 percent, according to its [**website**](https://www.ucr.edu/about/facts.html).

**//A big reason this has not been reported by the major news networks is right here.**    Lester Holt of NBC Nightly News, apparently a member of the  Illuminati   since the 1980's, along with ABC Nightly News lead anchor  David Muir,   stop over to the Porter studio in Buffalo on January 14th,  2019 at   5:00am. They both rape and kill about two dozen boys by  6:00am. Muir   starts around 5:15am, then Holt about 5:38am.  Multi-billionaire Rupert   Murdoch, owner of News Corp &amp; Fox  Corporation, takes his turn after   Holt. Video links below:

Mainly curious because I personally considered a number of career paths during my time at UCSB and I want to see where others with a similar background have gone. Hopefully this can also be useful to the current undergraduates in these majors or considering these majors!

&amp;nbsp;

Here is an (optional) guideline that will hopefully lighten the effort required and encourage more lurking alumni to post. I think the first two are the most important, but more info is also useful!

&amp;nbsp;

**1) What what was your major and when did you graduate?**

**2) What have you done since then and where are you now?**

3) What was your background upon graduating? (GPA, research experience, internships, etc)

4) What did you like about the major and what advantages did you think it gave you in the ""real world"" ? (whether that be through skills it gave you, just the name of the degree, or whatever else)

5) What didn't you like about the major?

6) What other majors did you consider during your time here and how do you feel about those looking back?

7) What was the path that it took you to arrive at this major? (i.e. switched from something else. or chose the major because you had a particular career in mind)

8) Would you choose to do this major again? If not, what would you choose?

9) Advice to current students in this major?

10) EXTRA OPTIONAL: current salary?

&amp;nbsp;

Don't know if this post will pick up any traction but I hope it will! I'll post my reply a bit a later today as a comment, as I'm a bit short on time right now. I may also link this post to a few of my friends from this major and see if they'd be comfortable posting or even just giving me their answer and having me post on their behalf.

Thanks! Go gauchos!"

I'm currently taking Chem1A, Physics20, Math4A, Ling20, and two seminars. I have As in all of them so far but I fell like this amount of schoolwork is around my limit for getting good grades

I'm kind of at a loss for what classes to take next quarter (and a lot of the classes I want to take are restricted to pass 2 or 3, so I've got a while to decide)

I'm definitely taking physics 21 and chem 1b, and I want to take 2 more classes.

The classes I'm thinking about taking are Math8, PSTAT 120A, or Physics 101.  I'm more into Math 8 and Physics 101 but I've heard by an unnamed freshman physics teacher that it would be a good idea to take PSTAT 120A.

Hi everyone, my name is Kiyomi and I’m serving as the commissioner of AS Program Board for the 2019-20 school year. We are the board that brings you EXTRAVAGANZA, DELIRIUM, THE WARM-UP, WELCOME BACK, and more. We also host various events on campus, from lectures like In Conversation with Tyler the Creator to our free Tues films.

We’re hosting an informational session TODAY(11/13) @ 6PM IN CORWIN PAVILLION, where you can learn how the board works as well as have a chance to ask questions, meet the different board members, and find out how to get involved.

Our programming is funded by your lock-in fees, so your feedback is extremely important to us! (Even if you just want to tell us we suck.) We know that people aren't always happy with who we book, so we wanted to offer a space to clarify some misconceptions and offer more transparency on our process. 

ALSO WE’LL HAVE FREE FOOD! (YEAH!)

I'm an Aussie exchange student coming in for the Winter &amp; Spring Quarters, and I've been having some trouble with deciding what to do about housing. 

For starters, I'm 20 (turning 21 in 2020), and I've heard that most of the residence halls are for freshman/sophomores. On the other hand, the apartments seem to be pretty far from campus and that seems a bit bothersome, as well as socially isolating. Staying in off-campus accom is also an option but I know very little about that.

So I guess my questions boil down to:

1. What do other juniors do? Do they go off campus or stay in apartments? And do people still bother socialising outside of their circles? I guess this question would be summed up as, where would I fit in best?

2. For those of you who are international, what do you do? where do you stay/who do you socialise with?

3. How well integrated is the community? Do people go into IV to party or do they stay in their areas?

4. Do people make friends through clubs or do they tend to focus on flatmates/frats etc. (speaking of frats are they a thing?)

5. Lastly, how do those of you living in apartments find the experience? Did you already have a well-built social network when you moved there? How difficult is it to get to campu?

Overall I guess my main concern is where I can go to fit into the community and integrate, rather than being isolated.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!"

Later I heard complaints that the union was intentionally blocking bike paths and making as much noise around the library as possible (during midterm season). I think this is a shitty way to protest. 

I never understand this idea of blanket inconvenience as a form of protesting? Some people are with you, some people are against you, and some people are neutral. The idea of a protest is (in my opinion) to inform people of an issue, gain support from new people, and to prevent the people against you from ignoring you. Obviously a protest doesn’t go without inconveniencing ANYONE, but going out of your way to piss off bystanders doesn’t make sense to me?"

I plan on transferring to UCSB next fall via TAG as a physiology major, but I’ve been contemplating on changing my major to physics, focusing on biophysics, for more career opportunities.

I have also completed up to Calc 2, the Gen Chem series, and the Bio series, along with all general ed courses. Is this a hard major to change into with what I have completed so far, or should I stay another year at my CC and apply again next year? However, if a stay another year, I'll be transferring as a senior (&gt;90 semester/135 quarter units), currently at 89 sem/134 quarter units, and I’m not sure if that will affect me.

This subreddit has grown rather significantly in activity over the last two years. The following data depict the number of comments and submissions this subreddit received in the year-long periods dating back beginning a year prior to today, to eight years prior to today:

Period | Comments | Submissions
---|-------|------
1y | 46963 | 8919
2y | 28626 | 5170
3y | 19108 | 3423
4y | 16670 | 2750
5y | 18093 | 2757
6y | 20500 | 2487
7y | 17385 | 2017
8y | 15609 | 1791

In particular, note the approximate 50% year-over-year activity growth that occurred two years ago, and then the subsequent 64%+ year-over-year activity growth within the last year. It has been rather amazing having watched this subreddit grow from an initial 50, or so, subscribers eight and a half years ago to the now nearly 14,000 subscribers.

r/UCSantabarbara subreddit started out with the same three moderators that it has currently. While a few other moderators have come and gone, u/beetling and I have, thus far, been able to share the majority of the moderation responsibility. However, lately we've noticed we spend more of our time moderating than we'd prefer. As a result, we'd love some help.

You can do a lot of good as a moderator in 5 to 10 minutes a day, or every couple of days or so. Moderation requires skimming active discussions to check for anything that needs us, checking the report queue, and moderating as needed. You can expect to spend about 1 to 2 hours a week (4 to 8 hours a month) on in this role.

If you have an interest in becoming a r/UCSantaBarbara moderator, please submit the form at the following link:
https://forms.gle/kHCbL6NwxxNLeczb7

Regarding the form, there are a few things we'd like to highlight. Us moderators are not anonymous to each other; some of us not at all. Thus, if you'd like to become a moderator, you must be willing to forgo your anonymity with us. Additionally, we'd like the new moderators we add to be active members of the UCSB community in addition to this community. Therefore, the form requires you to be authenticated with your UCSB account, and will collect your UCSB email address upon submission.

Since this is our first meta post in a very long time, feel free to ask us anything, or provide feedback, good or bad, pertaining to the subreddit.

Thanks everyone!"

However, since i didn't take physics my first year, and did not take math 4a until this quarter, it is going to be  near impossible for me to make all the major requirements before next year. Next quarter i would have to take math 6a, 6AL lab, physics 1, and 109B, and i just don't see myself being able to handle that workload at once. I would also have to finish physics 3 and 4 back to back over the summer at some community college. Since they only offer 113A once a year, if i can't make it in by the end of summer i will have to switch to something else.   


Biochemistry seems like my next best option because I don't see myself doing Earth science and I don't want to stay an environmental studies major. BUT I didn't take any bio this year either bc i didn't think i would need it, so now I need to wait until this upcoming summer or fall quarter. 

As i understand, you don't need it to be accepted into the major, but is it a pre-req to essential upper division classes that are only offered once a year? Hypothetically if I switch into the pre-major and eventually get accepted, and take bio as a junior, would my graduation be significantly delayed?"

I'm a junior in a non-engineering STEM major. 

I did well at the school I transferred from. I was generally at or near the top of most classes I took. It wasn't a bad school, although less known and ranked lower than UCSB. 

I've always spent a lot of time studying but now I spend as much of the day/night in the library as I can mentally endure. Despite studying nearly all day, my performance seems to be lower than all other students in my classes. Only one midterm average has been mentioned; I was indeed a few points under it. Other than that, my thoughts are based on in-class comments from the professors, the amount of questions I've gotten wrong on the other exams, and my overall in-class pace.

I like it here. I like the campus, my classes, and my professors, but I feel dumb compared to the students in my classes and it's been getting to me. I feel like I'm constantly trying to keep up and that I'm not good enough for the major, then I read about these econ 10a horror stories--I feel like my department has been nice and pleasant albeit rigorous, and I have still had multiple days where I've wished I either stayed where I was or did something else.

I've talked with people with different majors and many of them have said they feel the opposite in their classes (i.e. they believe they are well above their peers). I mean, there's no doubt that there are tons of brilliant students here! but is this a normal feeling here? Or is everyone else (except for 10a) just crushing it?"

I’m currently enrolled in Chem 1A with Crisjoe Joseph and I’m struggling to find a method of studying that works for me. Everyone I’ve spoken to has told me to do all recommended practice problems, read the chapters we cover on the book, and do the practice quizzes &amp; exams. However, I find that this isn’t sufficient for me. While my friends have told me that getting at least 90% of the practice problems right on each chapter being covered will mean that I’ll get a good grade on the test, I found the opposite to be true. As I did really well on the practice questions, I was super confident when I walked into the first midterm, but ended up getting 70%. 

Although they don’t take as long as the practice problems, the test questions seem to require knowledge that isn’t covered in the practice ones. I feel like they’re also worded more trickily, and are more conceptual. Although the practice exams do help, there aren’t that many of them. Any advice/extra studying resources that might be helpful would be greatly appreciated!"

Today did not go well for me. I’m not talking about the difficulty of the midterm. I was well and prepared for the midterm and was confident I’d do well considering my performance performance on my first midterm (26/30), which I finished in 30 or so minutes, and the fact that I’ve gotten 100% on all the quizzes taken throughout the quarter thus far, alongside my prior knowledge from AP statistics which has carried over, alleviating a lot of the difficulty for me when it comes to understanding the material. 



Last night, i slept early and was confident with everything that I was going to be tested on. As embarrassing as it is to describe, it’s an excruciatingly painful feeling when your alarm does not go off in the morning because your phone was updating, you wake up 30 minutes past the start time of the exam to realize that you were supposed to wake up an hour ago, and then collapse in the hallway on your rush there because of extreme anxiety that causes a severe panic attack. 

I did end up making it to the lecture hall at around 8:52 am, where I walked in to a TA that was luckily able to arrange the exam for me with the rest of the time left. He was holding my exam in hand and noticed that I was supposed to be there an hour ago. I managed to finish around 20 problems (two-thirds of the exam) in the remaining 15 minutes or so, unaware that my end time was 9:07 am. I was probably one of the few people remaining at the end who was futilely attempting to get another problem or two finished. The highest possible score I think I’d be able to get is a 67%. 

In one lecture, I believe she told us that if we ended up doing well on this midterm (or final, I can’t remember), the weight of our other midterm would drop to 10% and the weight of this midterm or anything that would “replace it” would increase by 10%. I still don’t know if I can get an A, even if I have this opportunity. 

If I end up doing amazing on the final, which I wouldn’t say is far from impossible considering I don’t particularly find any of the material difficult necessarily, I think the highest I could get without any weight adjustments is a B. If I do end up getting it, I’ll just be super disappointed because it’s one of my easier classes and I wouldn’t have gotten the B because of not understanding the material—I would have gotten it because my alarm didn’t go off."

Would I be better off organising off-campus housing?

okay so basically: 
•i’m middle middle class, and FAFSA didn’t give us any money
•i’m taking out about 4000 in loans each quarter 
•i don’t have a solid idea of what i want to study

i’m a first year and i know it’s normal for me to not know what i want to study yet, but i feel like i’m wasting my parents’ money taking GEs that might not count towards anything when i do figure out my major. and i’m also regretting and stressing over the loans and interest that i’ll have to pay off later. would it be better financially to drop from ucsb and attend community until i figure myself out? i’ve had many people tell me that i should just finish at ucsb since i’m already here. but the money is really scaring me and i don’t want to be paying off loans for my whole life. 

i know i love ucsb, it’s beautiful here and my classes are alright. but the expenses my family has to pay makes me anxious. before attending ucsb, i brought you the idea of going to community first and then transfer, but my parents pushed it aside and viewed it as a disappointing decision... so i ended up here. but now i feel a little regret now that the prices are right in front of me as i look at my winter fees. i’ve come to accept that it’s okay if i don’t finish school in 4 years, i’ll be okay as long as i end up with a degree i’m happy with. but i’d hate to elongate my time in school while also racking up my student loan debt. 

sorry for such a long post, but this has been eating me away for weeks and idk how to bring it up (or if i should at all) to my parents without them feeling so much disappointment."

&gt;Rescheduling an examination during dead week (the week prior to final examinations) is strongly discouraged and will only be approved under extremely exceptional circumstances. **The purpose of dead week is to allow students to begin preparation for final examinations without academic obligations beyond the normal class meetings.**

-please don't take the elevators from floor one to floor two if you are able bodied
-please be quiet on the quiet floors. If you came to do a group project or study with friends please go to a different floor
-please keep your belongings in a reasonable space. There's no reason why one person should take up half the table with 4 notebooks, a laptop, an iPad, flashcards and and 30 pens
-we can all hear your music through your airpods, please consider lowering your volume
-please don't bust out an entire feast. There are many smell sensitive people. Also please close your mouth when you chew. 
-please don't hog the electrical outlets, consider plugging in a USB cable into your laptop while it's charging instead of taking up two outlets
-please clean up your trash, this is a shared space and we should be considerate to the cleaning staff
-please don't mess with people sleeping on couches or steal their stuff

I’ve was in therapy for 7 months but i stopped going when i came to ucsb because it didn’t seem to help. I don’t do assignments. I’m a pre-biology major and I’ve always cared about school and my future, graduated at the top of my class in high school and was on the varsity soccer team, I was determined and ambitious. Now I feel anxious, sad, tired all the time, and I hate it here probably because of my situation individually, not the school itself. So yeah I think i’m going to fail all my classes and i’m ashamed, I JUST reached out for help and was diagnosed with major depression and anxiety and I started medication a few days ago.

People that parked bikes out there weren't given any warning except for signs that were posted on specific racks.

First of all, people are still on campus for their fucking finals. Someone just got out of their final just to find out their bike got impounded for bullshit reasons and it was completely reasonable to park bikes there.

Second, the CSOs involved KNEW they fucked up. Those signs were posted on those rusty racks that are obviously due to get replaced. People parked their bikes in the racks that are basically brand new and those got impounded too, including mine. When they got called out for it, they stopped taking bikes and took the truck even though there was room for more bikes. They got caught fucking up their assignment and the thing is that they're still deflecting as if it's our fault they messed up by trying to impound the entire lot when it was only supposed to be specific racks. 

Third, even if they were parked there, where was the fucking email? I left my bike on campus and the sign wasnt there. There should have been an email letting people know that their bikes were going to get impounded but somehow those oversized overglorified wet floor signs are enough notice for us? Why should we take that for an answer?

On top of all of that, even if your bike is registered, you're going to be expected to pay to get it back. THEY want US to pay for THEIR mistake. I dont know about you, but a group of us are going to TPS office at 12pm tomorrow and we're gonna complain to their faces because IM not gonna be charged for this, none of the others in our group are gonna be charged for this, and if your bike got stolen, you shouldn't be either because TPS has to take more accountability for their bullshit, especially during finals week.

Friday December 13th, a group of us went to talk to TPS. The CSO’s are able to hold on to non-registered bikes for 90 days, so even if your bike was not registered, you are protected over the break. The timeline for registered bikes will be about the same, if not a little longer. We were able to agree to send out an email to people involved in the process of impounding bikes. In the email, we listed out multiple demands:

• That all wrongfully impounded bicycles, whether they were registered or not, be returned to their owners

• That all fines related to the aforementioned bicycles be completely waived taking into consideration the personal damages and inconveniences incurred by the affected students

• That all relevant parties compensate the affected students for the locks that were damaged in the process of impounding bicycles

• That this incident leads to a more efficient outreach system between students, faculty, and UCSB Services, perhaps similar to the campus timely alerts, that would help to alert students of similar projects in the future so that we might avoid the lack of communication that led to this incident

We are still waiting for a response because of when the email was sent out, but hopefully, we will be able to get that. In the meantime, we are collecting the full names and perm numbers of people affected by this impound so that you can also be compensated even if you did not get the chance to talk directly to us. Please spread this as much as you can so as many people see it as possible. If you or a loved one has had a bike impounded from the parking lot between Physical Sciences South and Davidson Library, you may be entitled to compensation. Please don't wait, email cruz.ivana.p@gmail.com today for a chance to get your bike back and to get updates about the impound. Affected students email now! cruz.ivana.p@gmail.com."

So I just got my Anthem UCSHIP ID card in the mail and I was wondering if it covers therapy? I received a scholarship for the insurance fee so I assume I get the full benefits, but I'm not sure about psychological help. My anxiety has only been getting worse as the years go on and it's become so debilitating, I need to start seeing someone. I also have insurance through Kaiser from my parents, but the closest Kaiser is in gd Ventura and I need my therapist to be in Santa Barbara if I'm going to be seeing them regularly, which I plan to.

If UCSHIP does cover therapy, is there a limit to how many sessions I get per quarter? Also, is there a way I can just schedule a session online and go from there? Thank you guys so much, I'll continue to try and find this out through the website but I would appreciate any knowledge from anyone who has personally gone to therapy through UCSHIP."

Recently I’ve been considering a second major in English with an emphasis on creative writing to complement my biopsychology major. Now I am fully aware that biopsychology gets especially difficult on the second year (judging by the example schedules for students under the major—I’m not sure about upper divisions) and I do know that medical schools do not care what you major in, how difficult your major is, or how majors you’re doing; what they care about is your GPA, which they want as high as can be. 



Personally, I consider myself to be a passionate person about interdisciplinary studies. I have greater strengths in stem focused classes, that’s for sure, but I’m also very passionate about reading and writing and would like to exceed my potential in those respective skills and dive deeply into literature. I do aspire to be a doctor, but I have other ambitions in mind such as wanting to get works that have been in progress for years and months published. I have confidence in my creative writing ability as is and for me it’s the most potent medium of art for expression of emotion and meaning. Ideally, my most important goal in life is to help others, and I want to do so in a variety of different ways. Being a doctor and writer—as challenging as it may be to balance and pursue simultaneously—is an aspirational goal I want to accomplish. 


Additionally, I feel like the skills of reading comprehension and writing honed in the major will allow me to set myself apart in personal statements for medical schools and be able to dive into the comprehension-heavy section of the MCAT with a more intelligent and experienced approach. 



I suppose this post can also be taken as a direct question for Biopsychology and English majors in the upper division and perhaps post-upper division levels. If you have any insight on what these classes are like as I progress, it would be appreciated."

I was considering switching to ES way before this happened but they require these classes as well and overall I just feel screwed. I've finished all of my GE requirements so I really don't have any time to burn here at UC Santa Barbara, and I've finished the other math and gen chem requirements for the pre bio major, so I feel like I've already invested too much time here to quit. My friends told me to just tough it out until I get to the promise land of EEMB because that's really what I'm interested in and I grasp the concepts that my friends are learning in those classes, but I just don't know if I can make it. I've been depressed all quarter and that's taken a huge toll on my education. I tried my absolute best and this isn't nearly close to cutting it. I don't know if any of you have any advice or have been in my situation, but I'd love to hear it, because I'm really desperate for answers right now about what to do moving forward.

To be honest, this school makes me hate existing, I'm miserable here knowing that at the end of the day all they care about is money and research, and have dealt with far too many apathetic professors to feel like this is even close to being a home, but it would also destroy me to quit. The fact that we have weeder classes in the first place is just disheartening and doesn't encourage us to learn, but rather intimidates us. Sometimes I just want to die and have this whole thing be over. I just can't process what these failing grades have done to me and my goals and I really need some help. If you know anything about anything I've talked about today please give me some advice; I'm losing hope fast."

I forgot to mention earlier that the ungraded page from MT2 is also now graded your TAs will count this into the MT2 grade). Full credit was given for students who chose correct answers. BTW, who drew a laffer curve and called it a “Laughter Curve”??? The econ dept will have a laugh about it for many years. Hopefully the TA who graded the final can send me the name of the hila(R)ious person.

I have also graded the first four questions on the final now. These pertained to the work that you had performed or submitted.

I think I need to check with Drs. Opera and Harmon how some of you passed ECON 1 and 2 without knowing how competitive equilibrium works. Oh shoot! One student that passed also did not know how competitive equilibrium works. The Econ dept really need to be more strict in Econ 1/2 grading, I guess?

Most of you had some idea that price changes cause substitution and income effects, and if it was an art class, everybody would get credit for their original and creative interpretation of mathematical reality. Also, only a few students paid attention to the fact that you were given the K and Q… for full credit, you should have calculated the L as well!

Question 3 was well mostly handled, just one student presented alternative facts compared to what is economically possible. Maybe consider biochemistry as a more appropriate major. I hear that the major will soon have appropriate positions open. 

That’s all for now, time for some sleep…."

I received a B+ that I didn’t agree with.  Unfortunately, it was a class with a TA.  It is easier to discuss grades with profs.  I decided to write the TA anyway.  I was in the dark about my final paper and final exam grade; so while asking for more info I provided my “justification” for asking for a higher grade.  

It took her three grueling days to respond, but she revised it up to an A.  Today is 19th; and I’ve had later changes as well.  

I write this to encourage others to defend their work but also don’t wait! I have seen some wait until next quarter.  Be passionate, waiting isn’t passionate.  They need to see you appreciate them but also believe in your work.  

I hope this inspires some introverts to challenge grades they find unfair.

Also I have been in forensics for the past 2 years and will be doing it senior year so would that count for anything?

Thanks in advance"

I, like most students, am ready to sign up for classes as soon as my pass time starts.

So during November I reconciled with the idea that I was going to fail 120A, because I didn't take it serious enough. So I made no plans to study for the final other than take ten minutes to write a cheat sheet (which I quit five minutes in) before the exam. 

Just tried to test myself to see all the gaps in my knowledge to study for next quarter (which was alot), failed it like I expected, and YET somehow came out with a passing grade.

For any CCS physics majors, do I have a chance of getting in?

Tl;dr - what should my stats and ex’s look like if I want to have a good chance at CCS physics 

I’m currently a junior and have scored 1460 on the SAT in October and plan to take it again to hopefully get above 1500 (I’ve scored 1500+ on 4/5 practice tests), and have scored 1470 on the PSAT with 221 index but probably won’t get semifinalist because of California’s cutoff. I also plan to take math 2 and physics subject tests. 

So far, I feel like my test scores are pretty solid and and will probably improve, but my GPA is kind of lacking. I was an unmotivated idiot sophomore year, mostly first semester, and had trash grades but I had one b with 4 weighted classes this semester and my only B (88) being in AP lit so I’m pretty confident I can get all A’s next semester. I’m also taking Calc and probably an astronomy class at my local community college over the summer, and with that, my UC gpa will probably be a 4.0-4.1 when I apply. The hit to my gpa sophomore wasn’t for totally no reason though, I was dealing with the death of one of my best friends, so hopefully that could be taken into account. What do you guys think? 
 
In addition to that stuff, I played soccer freshman year and was captain, but have been running since then (track and cross country) and am a junior assistant coach at my club team which all takes a ton of time with how much commitment running takes, am in astronomy club although I haven’t done a lot, and am a ref for youth soccer games (payed). 

CCS for physics at UCSB seems like an amazing program and would give the opportunity for a ton of growth and the small, academically focused and intellectual community is somewhere I feel I would fit in very well and would really love. Is it realistic that I could get in?"

After a few months of issues I'm now basically certain someone working at the CVS by Storke and Hollister is either intentionally shortchanging my necessary meds or stealing them. (They do have potential for abuse but I need them for real).

I'm short about a weeks pills from a month's supply of one and they marked a two week supply of a med as 30 day preventing me from getting a refill right before winter break (it was not cool).

I'm going to speak to my doctor's office about it but is this something I call the police department about immediately or should I wait until I speak to the doctor's office?

It's two different doctor's scripts because one is a specialist btw so it isn't the doctor's office I don't believe."

The day has finally arrived!  Introducing the new UCSB Subreddit syllabus bank!  In order to get this project on its feet, I need your help!

This is obviously going to be a crowd-sourced bank, so you will need to make submissions of your syllabi to add to the bank.  Only pdf files are accepted; if you have a word document as a syllabus it will need to be converted first.  This will be done [here](https://forms.gle/qXCbMAo8M8uXLth27) ([https://forms.gle/qXCbMAo8M8uXLth27](https://forms.gle/qXCbMAo8M8uXLth27)).  **Please note: you must have a valid UCSB Gmail account to make submissions, and your email address will be recorded when making a submission** (this is in the event I need more information about your submission.  *Your name will NOT be displayed on your document nor is it connected to your Reddit username in any way, so your anonymity on Reddit remains*).

Once you submit your syllabus, it will appear in the syllabus bank, located [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bz2_N081qnslfnJhU0lrVUF5aS1vbGdxQW9pS2NGM1N0SnRVYl9jYXNQdm55a0NRbkZDdGc?usp=sharing) ([https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bz2\_N081qnslfnJhU0lrVUF5aS1vbGdxQW9pS2NGM1N0SnRVYl9jYXNQdm55a0NRbkZDdGc?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bz2_N081qnslfnJhU0lrVUF5aS1vbGdxQW9pS2NGM1N0SnRVYl9jYXNQdm55a0NRbkZDdGc?usp=sharing)).  It will take 24-72 hours for it to show up here as it needs to be approved by the system.  Again, you can only access this with a UCSB Gmail account.

I am really excited about setting up this feature for you guys, as you have requested it heavily!  If you have any feedback about the syllabus bank or submission process, please do not hesitate to PM me.

Happy studying!"

emibho,As one of the few African-Americans that is a student here Im surprised at the huge amount of covert racism I have experienced at UCSB on and off campus,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/emibho/as_one_of_the_few_africanamericans_that_is_a/,TheFoxCade1345r,1,2020-01-09 15:51:11,69,/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/emibho/as_one_of_the_few_africanamericans_that_is_a/,NaN,"I actually have had multiple negative experiences with social exclusion, people giving me weird looks, and making snarky comments. I have even had people in the bookstore follow me around the store as if I was going to steal.  In my classes I am the only black person there and people just ignore me. I even had a group research project last quarter and all of my work was removed last minute before we presented. When I go back to my hometown I have a completely different experience. Today I just had my neighbor completely avoid me and walk on the complete opposite side of the sidewalk to ignore me while we turned down the same alley.

It really upsets me because I am forced to do these stupid modules on race and gender as if I don't know what racism and microaggression is and yet I have been experiencing it since my first quarter. I am doing well in my classes but I just cant help but feel frustrated at how this school proudly proclaims how they embrace diversity and yet African-Americans still get left out. I have California Residency, but I did not grow up here, I just cannot stand how this state is hugely democratic and yet still fails minorities.

Sometimes I honestly want to just leave and go to a different University where I won't have to deal with snobby bigots. I just don't really feel like I fit in here.

Here is a list of easy classes I have taken over my time at UCSB! Please add more in the comments!

Music 17 - World Music with Ragheb. 5 pop quizzes and attendance taken, but very easy quizzes. No midterm or final. Interesting paper you get to right with loose guidelines. You listen to music and learn the history of music from different locations across the globe. Very fascinating, required concert that was great to go to. 

RG ST 21 - Zen Buddhism with Hillis. Buddhism is interesting, especially the concept of impermanence and the attachment we have to things. Two essays (final is fun), one midterm. Hillis is pretty funny and he is enthusiastic about the material

Classics 20 - Ancient Greeks with Gallucci. If you have not heard about Gallucci yet, then get ready for your mind to be blown. He is very monotone in voice, but the midterm and final are extremely straightforward if you put in minimal effort. I did not go to some classes because it was MWF and F is for tossing, and still did very well. During the midterm, he made the joke ""Are you sure you are all in the right place? I have never seen so many people in this class before!""

Music 15 - Music Appreciation with anyone. You should know about this one by now :)

RG ST 4 - Intro to Buddhism with Hillis. See above for RG ST 21

Econ 134 - Financial Management with (I can't believe I am really saying this but) John Hartman. If you like simple math and like to solve puzzles, this is a good class. There are twist to some problems,, but the twists on the practice exams and the exams themselves are fun and keep you engaged. Adrenaline carries you through the tests.

I hope that this post will be helpful in informing students about potential safety concerns associated with ATO as well as hold the fraternity accountable for its actions. 

I was on 65 dp waiting to meet a friend a few houses over from ATO when a guy came over from the ATO house and approached me.  The guy appeared intoxicated and asked me if I wanted to fight.  I replied, ""No, I'm just waiting for a friend.""  The guy went back to the ATO house and I thought everything was fine, but then the guy came back with a large group of people from the house and he accused me of hitting his friend.  I responded that I had not and didn't even know his friend.  The group of guys started shouting at me and I called the police and started walking away, but they followed me and one of them shoved me and then punched me on the side of the head, while I wasn't looking at him.  I fell to the ground and they ran off.  The punch made contact with my ear and the side of my head went numb.  My ear is now very swollen, my head feels tense, and my upper jaw is a bit sore.  I believe we as the UCSB community shouldn't tolerate this type of behavior and ATO needs to be held accountable for its actions.

So I know prof Stewart said the Coffeehouse performances are mandatory (3 out of 4), but does anyone know if he takes roll or if he expects us to write about them in our blogs?

Also, IDEK how a professor can make weekend events mandatory when people have jobs but oh well. And 2 out of the 4 shows are on three day weekends :/

During 2008, UCSB experienced a budget crisis and rather than making budget cuts in the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean courses offered, the East Asian Cultural Studies major cut Korean courses entirely!

There is a significant amount of Korean Americans on campus (people like me!) who haven't had many opportunities to learn about our culture which makes it difficult to feel proud of or even connected to our Korean heritage. American education curriculums don't emphasize Eastern cultures nearly enough. UCSB as an amazing public institution should be doing a better job providing courses for people who want to study Korea, it's language, history, literature, art, government, etc especially at a time such as this where the popularity of Korean culture is skyrocketing.

**My question is would you be willing to take a Korean course if it were offered? If you would be willing, will you sign a petition I am creating?** Not just language but any course focusing on the nation of Korea. I'm going to write a petition voicing these desires to the Head of the EACS Department and I need your signatures if this is something you would be willing to support! Please let me know your thoughts below. The hope is that multiple departments will offer more Korean courses and possibly new professors could even be employed! 

[https://forms.gle/JVjAucQr7wNNS9MP6](https://forms.gle/JVjAucQr7wNNS9MP6) (CLICK THIS LINK TO SIGN THE PETITION)

*(Also, it's so important to note that I believe every student should have the opportunity to learn about their culture or another culture. I'm specifically advocating for Korean courses because I am Korean American and see the lack of courses despite a large Korean population at our school. If another person were to propose a petition like this for a different course, I would be happy to support them! This isn't about being nationalistic, but advocating for small changes to hopefully create a more well rounded community!)*"

It also seems that it is common to have your schedules hidden before classes start and not two weeks into the quarter (my schedule was visible until yesterday).

For my own sanity, I just want someone to tell me if they think my classes were dropped and what to do besides go to the BARC office. I do plan on doing that, but having this sense of uncertainty is making thinking impossible. Also, if anyone has had their classes dropped, especially around this time of the quarter, I'm just wondering what I should expect (ie. Will getting access codes be difficult? Should I just not attend this quarter? Am I fucked? Etc)"

Basically, he also has self-destructive addictions which are going to probably make him drop out of school.

He's a fellow gamer and I want to help him get help, but at the same time it's not my duty to cross this particular boundary. The most I think I can ethically do is try to motivate a fellow ucsb student to help me reach out to his friends and for his friends to help him, or maybe reach out to the school's counseling center and tip them off with the problems that Brad is facing (mainly, self-destructive addictions) kinda like in the linked reddit post.

Either way, I want to remain anonymous and not have him know that I'm doing this. I just want to remain his ""gamer friend"" that he can confide in, but I don't want him to realize that I did all this reddit stuff behind his back. The situation I'm in reminds me of a quote by Elie Wiesel that sometimes doing nothing is more evil than being outright malicious.

You fucking bastard. 

Last quarter at DLG you would come in during Sunday brunch. You would squeeze the lemons at salad bar and then leave them. Leave them for me to pick up. I despised you for the longest time. Why are you so lazy. Just squeeze the lemon at the table and throw it away then. You vexed me for the longest, I made it my goal to find out who you were. Once the quarter ended I was relieved that I no longer had to pick up after your squeezed lemons. I no longer had to put up with you and your inconsiderate outlook on salad bar workers. 

Until tonight.

You came back, on the business night of the week and squeezed a lemon, only for me to see it. Lemon Man you son of a bitch, you have evaded me for WEEKS. MONTHS. I will find you and confront you eventually, Lemon Man. I hate you. Not for the way you refuse to dispose of your citrus rinds, but for the mere fact that you have managed to elude me for so long. 

Lemon Man, I don't want to hate you, far from it. I hope eventually we could be allies. We could go bowling or listen to NPR or something, idk. We could be great pals, but you choose to act like an utter buffoon. There is an obvious order to the world and you're tearing the structure apart one social norm at a time.

So I'm a second-year PBS major, hoping to graduate at the end of my third year. How many units do I need to graduate? I've basically planned out how many units/what classes I need to take every quarter (plus one session of Summer school) in order to have Spring 2021 be my last quarter at UCSB. If all goes according to plan I should have 188 units after Spring 2021 and I think the website says 180 units to graduate but I just wanted to see how realistic this would be. :) Thanks!

Also, these units include a Religious Studies minor, as well as Honors Experiences, which is why I'm basically taking 17 unit quarters all this year and next year.

Here are my numbers:

First-year: 41 units

Second-year: 49 units

Summer session 2020: 12 units

Third-year: 54 units

Transfer units: 32

On-campus units: 156

UD units: 69

Total units at graduation: 188"

idea: (in the form of a reddit thread) 
disclaimer: this is a crowdsourcing idea so i’m not sure it will work. 

we should have a thread where people can find other people who can record and/or take notes for specific classes. or people who can share the notes they get through DSP. maybe even people who can take your iclicker if it’s an attendance mandatory class. (disinfect ur clicker tho)

anyway the point of this is to make it so people can stay away from classes if they’re sick (even if they don’t know they have the virus) or if they’re more at risk for contracting the virus. 

this doesn’t really help with the 1st 2weeks of the virus but contamination from coughing and fluid can be avoided. also, if the virus makes it onto a surface it has the chance of infecting anyone who touched that surface for a few days. so use disinfectant wipes."

I've been applying to a lot of places for the summer but responses have been pretty slow.

A couple questions:

* Did you do a lot of side projects (outside of classwork) prior to graduation? 
* How important are CS skills for landing a job, since the stats major at UCSB doesn't include a lot of CS classes?
* Was the career fair/handshake useful in landing a job, or did you have connections that helped more?

  
Any input is much appreciated, thank you!"

RE: **Upcoming Core Router Replacement Project**

\*\*This message is being sent on behalf of Kevin Schmidt. Please do not reply to this message.\*\*

Dear UCSB Campus Community,

On February 5, 2020, work will begin to upgrade the UCSB Core Network with 10 new Cisco core routers across seven campus locations through April 2020. 

Work will occur overnight and may include network outages up to three hours. We don’t expect any outages during work or class times, but we could experience impacts elsewhere on campus. 

The physical core router replacement will affect the locations below on the following tentative dates: 

* **North Hall - Building 535**
   * The first router was installed on Tuesday, November 12, 2019
   * Complete, no public impact
* **Public Safety - Building 574** 
   * Wednesday, February 5, between 9 a.m. and noon 
   * No public impact expected
* **HSSB - Building 515** 
   * Wednesday, February 26, between 3 and 6 a.m.
* **Physical Sciences North - Building 657** 
   * Wednesday, March 4, between 3 and 6 a.m.
* **Noble Hall - Building 544** 
   * Wednesday, March 25, between 3 and 6 a.m.
* **Harold Frank Hall - Building 556** 
   * Wednesday, April 1, between 3 and 6 a.m.
* **Public Safety - Building 574** 
   * Wednesday, April 8, between 3 and 6 a.m.
* **North Hall - Building 535** 
   * Wednesday, April 15, between 3 and 6 a.m.
* **North Hall - Building 535**
   * Wednesday, April 22, between 3 and 6 a.m.
* **Portola - Building 1861**
   * Wednesday, April 29, between 3 and 6 a.m.

We will update you beforehand when work will happen and its potential impacts via the D-list, at [it.ucsb.edu](https://www.it.ucsb.edu/news), [status.ucsb.edu](https://status.ucsb.edu/), and at the UCSB IT [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/19077980), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ucsb.it/), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/UCSBIT) pages. Please note that you can subscribe [status.ucsb.edu](http://status.ucsb.edu/) to receive notices of service-impacting events at UCSB.

The new core routers, part of [UC Santa Barbara’s Next Generation Network program](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sPqEn7G3o-esmb5uhv8ZxcTaUl8di_bB0i51irg55kg/edit?usp=sharing) to invest in the campus data network infrastructure, will enable intra-core connections at 100 gigabytes and building connections up to 25 gigabytes. This will create a more robust and reliable campus network that allows for higher internal traffic processing.

If you have questions or need assistance, please email [noc@ucsb.edu](mailto:noc@ucsb.edu). 

Thank you for your patience as we undertake this mission-critical initiative."

This isnt about the virus but is an honest question about your opinion on how international students are accepted. 

My opinion: The school keeps admitting more and more international students without consideration for how they will fair in American college life because they know they will bring in more money. They can charge them more. They now are taking the places of American students even if their applications are not as competitive as that of American students. This isn't fair to the international students as they are not equipped to do well here. Of course this doesnt apply to all, but to many it does as there is a language barrier. This also makes it harder for teachers and other students. It seems to be only the school is benefiting via the income it receives. Also why should these students get a place if they are just going to take the skills and education they get and take it back to their home country rather than contribute to our society? 

Anyway my question is does anyone agree with this? If not, why not?"

Our question is this: does anyone have experience with the roommate groups being split up within the apartment?

Will we have to cut our losses and stick to a two person group, hoping she can beat others to the other room during her pass time?"

What does that bathroom smell like? --It smells like ass, ammonia, beef jerky farts, Golden State Warriors this season, my grandpa’s outdoor bathroom in rural China, skunks, your ex’s breath…

What’s the smell then?-- I don’t know.

We are good at making metaphors, and oftentimes we need those metaphors to approach truth, because we are far away from it and our languages have plenty of limitations. It’s an intrinsic aspect of humans, and it’s really weird. Well, our culture and behaviors are really weird in general. 

Like, compared to animals, we somehow designate areas to urinate and defecate. Then, we make it a convention, eliminate the smells of the bathrooms, and make it a convention again. Arbitrary or inevitable? Maybe both. I guess they aren’t mutually exclusive.

Moreover, bathrooms have become places not just for waste excretion(why do I sound like a biologist? fine, shitting and pissing), but also places to wash hands, brush teeths, adjust our looks, and even to some extent, socialize, stare at phones(a HUGE extent), reflect in silence, paint, vandalize, prank and so on. Bathrooms themselves have become metaphors for anthropological history, somehow. 

Before I wrote the previous line, I had a severe writer’s block. I just didn’t know what to comment on the bathroom, or the human species in general. Maybe it’s because I was in the wrong setting: Only if I was writing in the bathroom instead of the library. When I’m in the bathroom(without a phone ffs), I am Plato; when I’m in the library, I’m a potato.

But, the potato overcame that writer’s blog eventually. How? I don’t even know.  

Since I came to college, I have become more comfortable saying “I don’t know”. After all, we are immersed in an ocean of unknowns and uncertainties. We will swim against the tide and get on the shore, somehow, someday, or not.  

One last metaphor: that bathroom smells like a dissection lab in the biology class. To whoever is in charge: please do something about it.

Male bathroom on the 2nd floor UCEN: 3/10

PS: this blog was written on Friday. I hope the smell is gone otherwise I’ll be sad.

I'm currently a member of the L&amp;S Honors program, which requires me to complete 40 hours (I'm pretty sure) of community service/volunteer work before I graduate. I know we receive emails about random volunteer opportunities, but a lot of them involve teaching/working with children I feel like, which I personally am really not down for or good at.

Does anyone know of any volunteer opportunities at a local hospital? I want to apply to an accelerated bachelor's program for nursing after I graduate, and feel like having volunteer experience at a hospital would really help me. Particularly, I plan to become a SANE (sexual assault nurse examiner) nurse, so any opportunities in that particular field would be very helpful.

Or I would also love to volunteer at the local Planned Parenthood if they allow that sort of thing.

Thanks!"

And yes I know this school is so big and blah blah blah and you shouldn't let people get to you and blah blah blah but they did. They give me dirty looks when I'm just walking around campus and make fun of me a lot. I really did not do anything to them and my therapist says that often people become the antithesis of what they claim to value. I think she's right. The POC here claim to be in solidarity with one another but that isn't the case when it comes to me I guess. Honestly, White people have been the kindest to me despite me not fitting in with them or feeling completely comfortable around them. Like, drag me if you want to about that but that's just been my honest experience. Being here is so challenging and everyday I wish I were somewhere else. The bullying got so bad, I deadass wanted to fucking kill myself. The people that think they're so progressive and so kind literally made me want to fucking die. But, anyways, I just want things to be better now and not have this minority of people dictate my happiness any longer. I know everyone suggests trying clubs and orgs and while I've already done that, I'm open to more suggestions/advice."

GoGaucho GOLD is a website for you to browse, search, and filter courses.

It is designed for lower-division students to search for courses and schedules, and know what courses to select at each pass time.

It is designed for computer. The page might be a bit clutter on phone.

You can:
1. Search courses by department, by GE, or by search bar.
2. When using search by GE, you can choose multiple GEs, select which GEs must an entry have, and at least how many GEs in your criteria should one entry have.
3. See the enroll trend of 2020 Winter and 2020 Spring quarter. You can also see what other quarters was this course offered and how many spaces were left back then.
4. Select courses and get all possible schedules from your selection. 
5. Specify the earliest and latest time to take a course, and the break time between two.
6. Specify what lectures or sections you don’t want to take.
7. Force the planner to leave a free time at a chosen date and time range, such as leave time for lunch.
8. Once you get your schedule and feel that it’s too empty, you can search for courses that does not conflict with current selections and preferences.

The reason why I'm doubling up on the math classes was because I didn't do too well my freshman year, so I feel as I'm behind in my math track and I'm trying to catch back up. To be honest, I was actually considering only taking 2 classes between math 6B, math 8 and pstat 10. 

I'm typically used to 12 unit quarters because I'm also working part-time (~15 to 20 hrs a week). 

Thank you!"

The Department of Psychological Science at the University of California, Irvine is currently accepting applications to our post-baccalaureate program in psychological science (the deadline to apply for Fall 2020 is May 22nd). 

**Program** **Overview:**  UCI’s Post-Baccalaureate Program in Psychological Science is a certificate program that combines psychology coursework with research and/or internship experience. It is designed for people who have a bachelor’s degree (in any discipline); who are interested in a psychology-related graduate program, career development, or career change; and who could benefit from additional coursework, research and/or real-life work experience in psychology. Those interested in doctoral-level or master’s degree programs in a range of areas of psychology (including clinical/counseling psychology, social/personality psychology, developmental psychology, health psychology, psychology &amp; the law, and school psychology) or health (e.g., public health, medical school) can strengthen their graduate school applications by completing our program, which offers an individualized course of study based on each person’s qualifications and goals.  Students who have completed our program have been accepted to a wide variety of graduate programs, including Ph.D. programs at UC Berkeley, Cornell University, and UC Irvine; Psy.D. programs at Cal Lutheran, University of Indianapolis, and Yeshiva University, and Master's programs at NYU, Columbia, and UCLA.

**Program** **Description:**  The program consists of eight courses, which may include lower- and upper-division lectures, small seminars (including advanced statistics and research methods), hands-on research lab courses, and/or hands-on internship courses.  The program can be completed at the student’s own pace, in as little as 9 months or in as many as 24 months, depending upon one’s schedule and preferences.  A faculty advisor will work closely with students to help plan courses and provide guidance on obtaining letters of recommendation, choosing graduate programs, writing personal statements, and applying for jobs.  In addition, students will have the opportunity to attend our weekly departmental colloquia and other special events and to interact with our community of faculty, researchers, and graduate students.  For more information, please visit: [https://ps.soceco.uci.edu/post-bacc-page/post-baccalaureate-program-psychological-science](https://ps.soceco.uci.edu/post-bacc-page/post-baccalaureate-program-psychological-science)

**Information** **Session:**  An information session will be held on Friday, February 21st at 11am in Social Ecology I (SE-I) Room 112 on the UC Irvine campus ([http://uci.edu/visit/maps.php](http://uci.edu/visit/maps.php)).  All are welcome!"

I'm considering going to UCSB for my masters in experimental physics.

When I started my undergraduate, I really had no idea how different research groups can be. Just in the past few months I've found out that there is a group led by a professor I didn't meet until two terms ago. This group went totally under my radar, and probably receives 10x the amount of funding of any of the other groups (judging by the equipment they are using). I just found out this group has been working on a fusion reactor. At my tiny little school. What the heck.

I don't regret the decisions I've made -- I am passionate about and engaged with the research I am currently working on. This experience simply made it clear to me that I really didn't know ***anything*** about the research groups at my current college before I joined any of them.

Things have worked out for me, but I shouldn't leave my fate to chance like that. I should do better about getting educated about what the research culture is not just at a prospective school, but within the research groups there-within.

So I'm turning to your subreddit with the following questions:

1. Have you ever been, or do you have a friend who is in an experimental physics research group led by one of your professors?
1. How good does that group seem to be at securing funding?
1. How interesting is the research that group is working on?
1. Who is the professor leading that group?
1. Out of all of the research groups at UCSB that you know of, are there any that stand out, perhaps for their excellent leadership, ability to secure funding, or the advancedness of the technology they are working with?
1. How would you describe the research culture within this group? How are members treated by their leader and each other?
1. Are there any other ways you know of for me to get a gauge on the research culture ***within research groups*** at an institution like UCSB?

Thank you, I really appreciate any answers anyone here can provide. It would mean a lot."

I have a 3.85 GPA and school has come naturally to me, but I suffer severe panic attacks about grades. I have received one B in my life, and that did help break the cycle, but only temporarily. 

I know the problem is my mindset and what I focus on. If I direct my attention to learning new material and the present moment, it helps relieve anxiety and panic...but it always comes creeping back. What else can I do to help break this cycle of panic about school? I recognize logically that my grades mean nothing about who I am as a person or the qualities of my being, but it’s so damn hard to truly get my mind to believe that. 

I exercise every day and have great friends to talk to which can help, but they either don’t care about school as much as me (which can help talking to them) or they also share this mindset. 

I just want to be normal. I’m starting work soon after graduation, and while this mindset could carry over, I don’t think it will. I took time off school and worked full time, which I loved so much more than school"

1. You are going to have a shitload of fun. This will the best and the worst year of your college career if you decide to choose this
2. It is going to be tough. This isn't to discourage you, but in essence, this job prepares you for situations that you can't really train for. There will be shitshow situations but I can't guarantee it won't happen to you. I honestly feel that it has better prepared me for life
3. It makes you a better person overall. Balancing the job and school is a fuckin bitch. Time management is essential to success in both the job and the school. I had my best quarter at UCSB by far the first quarter as an  RA
4. You are the spotlight....constantly. Although it doesn't seem like it, this is true. I had residents know my name two days after moving in, and I didnt even introduce myself yet.
5. Flexibility. THIS JOB IS FLEXIBLE. you can submit time off for midterms or whenever you need it off. Its recommended that you stay for the first six weeks after move-in to establish a community but this job is flexible. Communicate to your RD's and bosses! They know school is hard!
6. Programming! This is the best part of the job! you can get free food for yourself and your rezies! Programming is where you can be creative, and you can shine!
7. Your Room. This is (can't stress this enough) YOUR GETAWAY! Whenever you don't want to be around or need to study, your single room will be there 24/7 so decorate it to your liking. Make yourself feel comfortable and make it so you can stay a day or two without needing to go out.
8. Snitching for free housing....... All be it, it is the worst part of the job. It sucks getting people in trouble, and those write-ups can be longer than some essays for classes. My best advice is to be strict in your first quarter so your residents know the boundaries and rules to have a lax rest of the year. I was that asshole who did write up people for quiet hours 15 mins after it started, but now everyone knows the rules and my last write up was probably four weeks ago
9. RA's actually party and hookup? Yes, you can still go to parties, blackout, get high and all the fun. And yes, you can still go on tinder and those dating ups. Although it's forbidden, I would highly suggest DO NOT HOOK UP WITH RESIDENTS AT ALL! I did break the rules and had a hookup, but once I called it off and I see her in the dining commons, it's extremely awkward and not really worth it now. When it comes to partying, be careful who and where your party with. Whenever I see a resident on DP I run in the other direction. (It's a fun tradition in my RA team)
10. Residents. The last thing, hate it or love it, they are the reason that you have a job and will look up to you for advice for anything. Everyone is afraid there first year (we have all been there. To them you're like a grandparent, you do hold some authority but you also aren't on top of them 24/7 like parents or the like. Be chill and understanding!  I love my residents and I see them being good friends in the future!

Now to getting the job, there are so many things that go into choosing an RA but lemme give you the FAQs on the interview process.

1. BE YOURSELF. Don't try to be someone else or put a fake act as they are hiring you for who u are. Be yourself and be professional. If you can manage to put an act to get the job, good fucking luck to you
2. Don't ask ""what-if"" questions. Being an RA, you are taught to expect the unexpected. I had 911 calls before a midterm and when I wasnt even on duty. You will be trained on how to handle basic situations but never ask these questions. 
3. Academics. Yes, you need a 2.5 and above but show that u can maintain that and can possibly develop new skills under the job! They (interviewers) know your in school and know your struggle so show that u can do it.
4. Don't be anxious. Literally a position killer right here. I get the pressure during an interview and all that (I've been there) but if you're shy and don't answer questions and try to steer clear, trust me, you won't get the interview.  To put it in perspective, if your anxious during an emergency situation or write up, you could lose ur credibility as am RA and possibly lose your job to not responding or yada yada yada (that's a rabbit hole too big to explore)
5. Relax, you were chosen for an interview for a reason. They saw something special in you and as cliche, as it seems, you have something that may bring value to the team! You don't know it yet, but you will find it in training and in the beginning
6. Have fun. Show that u have a fun side and arent stern or serious half the time.

I hope this answers a few questions for those hopeful RA's out there. If you have more specific questions feel free to reach out. You got this and you will kill the interview"

Yang is a genuine guy with the courage to actually fight for new ideas. He's been on the right side of the fence on many issues, and that's why he (supported by the Yang Gang), made such a positive impact. 

To all the Yang Gangers who have been out there putting in the work: you should be proud. It takes a lot of conviction to fight for a candidate that is considered an outsider, yet Yang outlasted several career politicians. That wouldn't have happened without you.  


UCSB Students for Bernie wants to give a shoutout to the Yang Gang, and let you guys know that we would love to have you with us. There's still a long road to solving problems like climate change, and we know that Yang Gang has the drive and conviction to fight for those solutions. 

For the Yang Gangers ready to keep up the fight, and any other students who want to get involved in politics, just send an email, PM, or comment. The California primary is on March 3rd (Last day to [register to vote](https://registertovote.ca.gov/) is this Friday, 2-14), and there's still work to be done.

Let's head to the high ground together,

What admissions really focuses on is the major required courses (understandably), such as the math and physics series. I believe hearing that a letter grade of C- or better is needed on all the major required courses. 

But what if I skipped Math 3A and 3B because of a 5 in the AP Calc BC exam? UCSB's AP credit website says that I've cleared 3A/B, but what about transfers who need that for a major requirement? Is it an exception from the letter grade requirement? Or do I need to take calc 1 and 2 at my CC? If that's the case, the situation would get super gnarly because I've already taken Multivariable calc and Linear algebra, which would mean that I'd have to take a prerequisite after those 2 (which is super weird and idk if any transfer ever had to do that). 

On [assist.org](https://assist.org), nothing about AP credits for transfers are mentioned. The only explicit thing I've seen is how the AP chem score can't be used for chem 1A, and something about Econ. I'm only using calc BC for my major requirements, so am I clear?"

Her roommate’s boyfriend graduated last year and thus comes to visit often. He used to come over every other weekend and sleep in the bedroom with the girls, which was no big deal since my gf and I travel back to Ventura county every weekend, so it didn’t bother her much because she wasn’t there.

However, since spring quarter began he started staying Sunday thru Wednesday EVERY week. He is a nice guy, but it makes my gf very uncomfortable when he sleeps in the same bed, in the same room as her roommate and her. This makes me feel weird too. Numerous discussions have been had, and her roommate refuses to budge because “it’s her room too” and she can “do whatever she wants”. Roommate doesn’t want to sleep in the living room when he’s, here, doesn’t want home to come over less often, and has not been cooperative at all.

There have also been personal space related arguments in the past that have gone the same route too (refusing to wear headphones in early mornings/late nights, making large messes in the kitchen, bedrooms, and bathrooms, etc.) and they have all ended in a similar way. There is now a lot of tension between the two of them, and we are unsure of where to go next. 

Again, if roommates boyfriend just slept in the living room or something, this wouldn’t be a problem. It’s not personal, just a boundaries issue.

We plan on emailing an RA, but I am unsure if a falling out between the girls could have disastrous consequences if either one of them don’t get their way. Do you guys have any advice?"

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently in Reads 109 B class and we have a midterm on wednesday. I don't feel ready, I have tried to keep up with all the material, but focused most of my hard core study time on midterms with eemb2/mcdb b in the past two weeks. I originally planning on spending most of my study time this weekend, but I fell of my bike and got diagnosed with a mild cocossion this friday. I have a hard time with concentration and looking at screens which makes long study sessions (all my books are ebooks) pretty hard right now. 

He has a rule that no matter your circumstances he will not make up midterms but you can miss one midterm and your final will count for  60%. The final is cumulative. Does anybody know if his finals are usually harder then his midterms? I got a 79 on his first midterm and I am trying to get at least a B in his class. 

Does this rule also count if you bomb one of your midterms or just when you miss one completely?

I am unsure about what to do right now since missing one midterm seems very scary, but bombing one midterm seems even worse. My final week is already more stressful since I scored worse on EEMB 2 than I hoped, so I need a good grade in that final as well."

Don't worry, we aren't going to pitch any candidate to you in this post, we just want as many students as possible to participate AT ALL.  


This is neutral information that ALL voters need to know that wasn't all included on the email sent out earlier today from UCSB admin:  


1) The primary elections are on March 3rd. They include local, state and federal elections. While a new law allows California  voters to register or re-register to vote at polling places on Election  Day, the Secretary of State office is requesting for all voters to complete their registration by February 18th. THAT'S TODAY!.  


**However, registering to vote LITERALLY only takes a few minutes online, and can be done at:**  
[**https://registertovote.ca.gov/**](https://registertovote.ca.gov/)  


2)  For those who have already registered to vote, they should take a  moment to visit that same website to double check their voter registration and make any last minute changes if they wish. If they want to vote at or drop off a ballot at a polling place in Santa Barbara on election day, **they should make sure that their Santa Barbara address is the one that they use.** To find their polling place they can visit: [**https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/polling-place/**](https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/polling-place/)   
3) Regarding political party and voting; two important pieces of information you need to be aware of:  


a)  To vote for a Democratic presidential candidate, CA voters CAN register  as any political party (including No Preference) HOWEVER if they do not  choose to register as Democrats, they must **specifically request a ""NPP Democratic Ballot"" from the Santa Barbara County Elections office \[(800) 722-8683\] or ask a poll worker for a NPP Democratic Ballot on the day of the election.**  


b) To vote for a Republican presidential candidate, CA voters **MUST be registered as Republicans. This is a rule enforced by the GOP; you MUST register as a Republican to vote for one of their Presidential candidates; there is no other option.**

c) If you want to vote for a Presidential candidate **outside of those two parties,** you should check out their website or social media for specific on the rules that they have decided on.   


There are student orgs all over campus and The Arbor registering people to vote (especially today!); talk to one of them or visit the website and fill it out yourself.  


If you have any other specific questions, I encourage you to contact the SB County Elections Office, or feel free to send us a PM/chat and we can help you out (Yes, we will help you even if you aren't planning to vote for Bernie).  


Thanks for taking the time; get out there and vote!  


Solidarity,  
UCSB Students for Bernie"

I only need and want to take one class next quarter, 4 units. With that I have completed the major.

I will only have a total of 29 units in the year.

My plan is to enroll in 12 units but then drop the extra classes after the financial aid census date.

I've heard this puts you on financial aid probation or something, but that because this is the last quarter ill be okay and will still get full financial aid.

I fucking hate this school. All those rich kids with nice cars and their parents pay for everything. No jobs and they have all the time in the world. Anyone can succeed in those circumstances so theyre fucking up the class curves. I dont have time to memorize all that shit since I work a full time job just to survive

And all the TAs are Asian. Not that that is a bad thing but how the fuck are you supposed to understand them? 

Fucking administration sucks. I was homeless and trying hard to pay for tuition. I asked about the emergency funding but they told me to screw myself. Dropped out of school for a year since I couldnt pay

Classes are hard to get into. One quarter I couldnt get a single one that counted. A counselor told me to drop the quarter and get a full refund so I tried. Only administration kept half the overall tuition. And I hadnt even been able to pay in full yet so I wasnt even fully registered.

Not to mention I got private loans this past year since everything else wasnt enough. Then the billing office didnt process it in time even though I got everything submitted early. Fucking money sat on their desk for 3 weeks and they still told me it was late

Changing major while adding a second major took a year to process because everyone is a dumbass and departments have a hard time communicating. It penalized me during registration

In high school I was at the top of my class and graduated community college at the same time with nothing less than an A. I am smart and had a hell of a lot of potential. This fucking school was the worst thing that ever happened to me

I wanna fucking sue the school for mistreatment"

also, the mf smacks on ALL food. I can’t be in the same room when she eats which is almost every second because she slurps and smacks so obnoxiously. even candy man...it’s so disgusting to hear her tongue smack the candy to the room of her mouth then producing saliva when she smacks it back down. im chinese/Japanese so i get slurping but she does it disgustingly. she’s just naturally so noisy and even quietly slams the door so I wake up from that too. 


I’ve asked her to go to the lounge if she’s gonna be noisy while I sleep, but she complains it’s colder than the room. also, she can’t really control her smacking habits and aggressive typing so it’s unfair to ask her to stop.

listen, university housing and off campus housing is ridiculous price wise. tuition is insane. i get some people get nice financial aid or their college is paid for via family, but for those of us who have to pay our way through college alone, (and those who are willing to stand in solidarity with us) now is the perfect time to start a protest/strike/whatever. COLA is drawing a bunch of attention to the UCs and our demands are pretty similar. UCs used to be free and then the prices rose exponentially, i’m not saying free college is the answer and i’m not saying it’s not, i’m just saying even if UCs had to start charging tuition, it should not be this high. it’s unbearable. every penny i earn goes into housing or tuition. i can’t even eat unless i get food bank food. i had to sacrifice healthcare. not to mention that not all of the tuition and housing costs we pay even go to our specific school or help us in any way. 

personally, i have no idea how to start a movement but i’m just saying, hey maybe if u know how to start to organize this thing, there’s not gonna be a better time to mobilize. an undergrad protest against rising costs will only help the COLA protests and vice versa. we’re all financially struggling so like let’s do something about it. especially since it’d be more likely to change something if we mobilize during this COLA movement than if it was spontaneous. undergrads and TAs fighting for the same things under different names, and ultimately supporting eachother. 

if student protests were able to result in an ethnicities requirement and like all of the ethnicity studies departments, we have a chance. but the ethnic studies movement had to occur when it did, during a larger state/nation/world wide minority rights movement, for such results. 

so how do we make this happen?"

My gf however, is older and lives in the dorm, she loves me a lot. She drives me downtown with her a lot and we get food and I’ll buy her little presents. 

She is very social and very pretty, however. She likes to be in IV a lot. I say I don’t want to, She says ok. 

She likes to go to parties, she says that parties are just people sitting around playing games with alcohol. I don’t really understand, I play games in my dorm and I don’t need alcohol. 

My roommates in a fraternity. He says he saw her at a party and she was making out with a guy. He says he kicked her out for me. 

But I don’t understand, why would she kiss someone? My roommate says a lot of parties have games, like she said, but a lot of people go to parties to meet people to date too. Said what she described was a “kick back”(I thought they were the same ) 

I asked her and she said my roommates lying. But I’m not sure. My roommate is nice, or at least he wouldn’t lie to me. He said his friend in another fraternity says she’s going somewhere to another one this Friday. I asked her if I could go and she said no. I asked her if I could go to a non fraternity party with her and she said no. My roommate says she probably goes out with other guys a lot, and that I should break up with her.

Here are some reasons why.

The statement of the problem is that graduate students in many areas are rent burdened and have lower living standards than what they deserve, which is legitimate and a serious issue that should be addressed. Going on strike and attempting to open up negotiations is one of the natural ways to tackle an issue that requires immediate resolution. But the approach to negotiations and demand to universally increase graduate student wage by order 1800 a month, were far from ideal. 

Firstly, defining rent burden by percentage of income is an idiotic idea. Take the definition of having 30% income as rent being rent burdened for example, then the remaining 70% would be your disposable income for other necessities and non necessities, but prices of most commodities do not scale like rent. Food at Target/Albertsons is not double the price in an area with double the rent relative to another area, a TV at one Best Buy doesn't cost a lot more in another. So if grads are being paid at 1/0.3 times median rent, a graduate student at a $1500 rent area would get $1500\*0.7/0.3=$3500 of disposable income, while a grad student at a $800 rent area would get roughly $1850. So the demands for a raise that is scaled to the median rent seems like a bad mathematical model to me.

Secondly, the sheer amount of income increase being demanded is very unreasonable, either as a serious request or as a negotiation tactic. An order 20k increase in annual income for thousands of graduate students per campus, is order tens of millions that a university needs to move around, they simply don't have that amount of money sitting around, and to restructure the university's budget to redistribute tens of millions is an immense task that certainly doesn't fit the case of searching for immediate resolution. An order 20k income would also put most graduate students' income past postdocs', in the short term the university simply wouldn't have incentive to hire any more graduate students in the following years as they can hire more qualified postdocs to do better work at lower cost. Or rather, postdocs would also need to have their income raised. That's even further burden on the university in addition to the unrealistic number COLA is already requesting. Even just as a negotiation tactic, it's highly questionable whether it's a good idea to overshoot so much to a ridiculous degree, and hoping to end up meeting somewhere not even close to the middle. Because this is not a zero sum game where both parties are agents of only their self interests trying to optimize their gain. A university benefits from having well paid graduate students producing good work and building the university's reputation, and graduate students benefit from a university with stable financial structure that is balanced across its various spendings to provide safe, inclusive and healthy work environments for all its employees. Perhaps a more cooperative spirit and more careful mathematical model in creating the demands would be much more productive, such as a small universal raise + small amount of extra subsidized housing units + some need-based financial aid + a long term demand for progressive change in the subsidized housing infrastructure and slow rise of income.

All this being said, it really is the implementation of COLA that is poor rather than the motivation. COLA is necessary, but needs to be done better. On another note, the brutality of the riot police against the peaceful protesters, the threats to fire graduate students on strike, the attempt to sidestep the union, are despicable, this is indisputable. 

I also hope that grads and undergrads would give each other more understanding. Please understand that the severity of the graduate students' financial burden certainly warrants actions such as strikes and protests, and most grads certainly empathize with undergrads regarding the stress caused by the grades withheld, their grades are definitely not to become a collateral damage, both the TAs and the university would eventually see to it that undergrads be compensated and not receive any unjust evaluation, as the undergrads are not liable at all. The graduate students on strike should also understand undergrads' concerns and stop dramatizing the struggles and enter into a pity competition of who has it worse, and calmly present the truth of the matter among all the tension. TAs on strike can give out grades to individuals with time sensitive grade requirements such as those who are on grade-dependent grants and financial aids, which I heard the UCSC COLA is doing very well at.

All in all, emotions are high, understandably, but please use your brain. Big brain, big results, yesh."

I think that we can handle this.  How much does the University spend on policing Deltopia?  How much did it just spend on cops to beat people at Santa Cruz?

$1752/monthx3=$5256/month.

Removing the TA/RA/Teaching Associate FTE figure (1032.3), and replacing it with the number of grad students (2965) (For this move, you have to accept the idea that all graduate students--not just as TAs or RAs, but in their own personal scholarship--bring value to the university and should be counted as full-time workers):

7365.65-1032.3+2965=9,298.35

Number of full-time workers who do not make a rent-stable wage for a one-bedroom apartment in SB County at UCSB: 9298.35-2606=6,692.35

Percentage of full-time workers who do not make a rent-stable wage for SB County at UCSB:

Average annual wage/full-time,bottom-72% worker: $206,610,855/6692.35=$30,872.69.

Amount needed per worker to achieve rent-stable wages for a one-bedroom apartment in SB County for all full-time workers at UCSB:
$63,072/year-$30,872.69/year=$24,500.69‬/year.

Total cost of the reckoning: $24,500.69/year x 6692.35 workers = $163,967,192.72/year.

Now I know this is a hefty sum, and I wouldn't put it down if I didn't want some better thinkers to tinker with it and correct my errors, but I become increasingly convinced that my arithmetic is pretty accurate and that my method is good.  Moreover, I know that my figures line up with my daily observations, so no red flags there. So, tinker away and create your own methodology, but also please remember that the UC's total revenues last year were $36,861,977,000 (https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/revenue-and-expense-data), and please start looking around and offering some analysis and critique of the frivolous shit that you see UC spending money on when I know workers on this campus who have to take extra jobs and commute from Oxnard to be able to keep food on the table for their kids.  Ask yourself, is this an environment--one in which seven out of every ten people you meet do not make a rent-stable wage for a one bedroom apartment--is this an environment that is especially good for living and studying?  What kind of education does one get from marinating for some number of years in an institution which takes this kind of inequity for granted?  Does it teach us all to take it for granted?  Does this kind of complacency in the face of a profound social problem sort with the UC's reputation for excellence?  Now is the time for us to try to lift ourselves out of this moral mediocrity and to fight to make this place better.  The grad students have led the way.  Regardless of your role at UCSB, if you have any ability to strike right now or to take some kind of action (and I know there are more and less vulnerable workers at UCSB), do it."

To: UC Santa Cruz Community
From: Interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer
Subject: Update on grade strike
 
Dear Colleagues,
 
As you are likely aware, in an effort to better support our Ph.D. and MFA students and help address the very legitimate financial concerns they have raised, we announced and implemented a number of new campus programs to help alleviate their financial burdens – and we are working together to provide greater levels of support. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts to find an amenable resolution, 54 teaching assistants have continued to withhold fall grade information. As a result, we have been left with no choice but to take an action that we had truly and deeply hoped to avoid. As I previously shared, students who fail to meet their contractual obligations by withholding fall grade information will not receive spring quarter appointments, or if they have received them they will be dismissed from their spring quarter appointments.
 
We care deeply about our graduate students, value their contributions to our campus through both their scholarship and research, and their work as teaching assistants and graduate student instructors. It is extremely disappointing to us that we have to take such a drastic step, but we ultimately cannot retain graduate students as teaching assistants who will not fulfill their responsibilities. While we have been able to successfully get 96 percent of grades submitted for the fall quarter, we cannot again jeopardize our undergraduates’ education or put them in a position where they may not have the teaching resources they need to succeed throughout the spring quarter.
 
I want to thank all of you who have had honest and difficult conversations with graduate students about the need to end this unsanctioned strike. Our graduate students are brilliant scholars and, like you, I want to see them succeed at UC Santa Cruz and beyond. No doubt your conversations encouraged some graduate students to return to their important work.
 
Alongside other campus leaders, I met five times with graduate student leadership with the hope that we could resolve this unsanctioned strike and return to our shared mission of educating undergraduates and conducting research for the good of our society.
 
While I’ve disagreed with the tactics the graduate students have used to communicate their concerns, I do not want to downplay the gravity of those concerns. The students have highlighted a real need for greater support because of the high cost of housing in Santa Cruz and limited campus housing available to them. As a reminder, in an effort to provide more financial support and predictability for our Ph.D. and MFA students and work toward greater support overall, the campus is:

providing an annual $2,500 housing supplement until more campus housing becomes available for graduate students. This support will be available retroactively for this academic year for doctoral and MFA students who resume their TA/GSI appointment obligations for fall, winter, and spring quarters.

offering new and continuing doctoral students support packages for five years (two years for MFA students). These packages will have a minimum level of support equivalent to that of a 50 percent teaching assistantship.

creating two temporary housing assistance programs to support graduate students through Slug Support.

forming a joint Senate-Administrative Graduate Education Working Group to develop a strategic plan for appropriate and sustainable graduate program support.

convening a new Chancellor’s Advisory Committee on Graduate Education to examine and make recommendations to improve graduate student support throughout graduate school and beyond as graduate students prepare for a range of careers beyond the professoriate. 

With a clear sense for how many graduate students will continue serving as teaching assistants in the spring, we can now begin planning for how we deliver an education to our undergraduates. As I shared at the Feb. 19 Academic Senate meeting, this is a problem for us to solve. I am committed to working closely with all impacted departments and providing additional resources so that we can continue with our mission. I will soon be visiting impacted departments to join in discussions about our curriculum.
 
This has been a difficult time for our campus and we have more problems to solve.
 
We all believe deeply in the mission of UC Santa Cruz and public higher education. We have the privilege to teach a diverse student body and provide them with knowledge and skills that can transform their lives. We have the honor to cultivate scholars who will be the next generation of professors and practitioners. And we, as professors, help reshape our world, whether it’s through ideas, inventions, and discovery.
 
I look forward to continuing to fulfill our tremendous mission.  "

Please stop falling into admin-directed fear-inducing misinformation about going into fifth year, losing scholarships, not graduating, etc. It is my understanding grades that can be afforded as leverage in the strike will be submitted as NG (no grade) guaranteeing units completed but withholding a letter grade.

I am an undergrad who's grades are being held. Wildcats please chime in if I've misspoken but my TA's were very clear with us and really truly have us in mind throughout this process, and received overwhelming support from us. Let's work together through this y'all."

Maybe everyone should take a look and see how those undergrad students feel, how it's affecting them (including the cancelation of their classes for the next term), the chaos that they're dealing with, etc. Maybe we should think about how it's affected them them and why so many of them are absolutely against the strike now, and how there is strong resentment against the movement.
