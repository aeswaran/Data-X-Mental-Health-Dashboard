Mybill however doesn't mention that at all and simply says I have -$1,400 on my student balance.

So far everything seems okay but there have been some things that have been bugging me. 

So I took the IB and some of them translated to credit. Namely Math HL, Physics HL, and some others. 

Math translated MAT 16A and 16B while Physics translated to PHY010 which are both useless for my major. 

I also have ""NSA TR1"" which says that they are Transfer no subject area and that I need to speak to my supervisor if I can transfer any of them towards my degree requirements. 

At least I think I might be able to transfer some of those TR1 courses to some GE requirements but I am not sure about the math and physics courses. 

On Mydegree, PHY010 and the NSA TR1 shows up in the ""unapplied classes"" section. My MAT 16A and 16B don't even show up except for my ""class history"" section where it says that I ""took the class"" on the very first quarter. I don't know whether these units count towards anything at all and I refer to them as ""ghost courses"". 

I mean, I already finished my math requirements and almost finished my physics requirements. At this point I am hoping that they at least count towards the 180 unit graduation units but I am not sure if these count at all.

Anyone who has taken the IB, do any of you guys have stuff that transferred over that is practically useless towards your degree? Do you know whether those ""unapplied classes"" or ""ghost courses"" units count towards graduation in any way?"

I asked the TA if they could explain some of the harder concepts in the textbook and the TA was just laughing at me and questioning me if this was already taught in class --to which I replied not all of it is covered yet by the professor. The TA then replied and said Why are you studying material that isn't taught by the professor it is so pointless and a waste of time. The professor usually covers everything so I wanted to do so ahead of time since my final is just a week away and I still have 2 more chapters to cover since the professor hasn't covered it yet. The TA also told me there's no use to reading ahead of time ---I've never heard of someone saying this-- then, I asked the TA some harder exam questions I found since I wanted to practice more and the TA began to question me more about why I was studying these questions and asked how this was related to what we were studying. I'm not sure why the TA asked this since it was very related to what we were studying and I felt like the TA didn't want to help me since the discussion was in an hour and I could see they were still trying to prepare for the class..which isn't my fault. I then proceeded to ask the TA some more questions and the TA began to tell me why am I studying this ..it probably won't be on the exam and it is too hard for undergraduates (the professor went over it today) this is graduate level stuff its pointless. Then the TA ended with-- I don't want to discourage you but its a waste of time to study things the professor didn't go over in class and things that aren't related and it won't help you to study the harder stuff either. I was pretty upset after the TA told me this because the professor did go over all the harder things in class and it doesn't seem like the TA was very interested in helping me at all.   


I've been pretty hesitant to report this to the professor because the TA is the one grading the exams and quizzes but I'm really bothered by the way I was being treated it felt like I was being bullied and honestly I just wanted some help..on understanding the material better. What should I do?"

I just finished writing an end to end tutorial for anyone seeking to replicate this, along with general information about Neuralink and other BCI companies. I also included a list of some resources (textbooks, websites, organizations, Github repos) that I found helpful. You can check out the article below on Medium.

I’d really appreciate any support or feedback. Additionally, if anyone is interested in learning more about the project or about BCIs in general, feel free to reach out and we can meet up on campus.

Problem is, this process needs to be completed soon so my reduced tuition fee is placed on mybill so I can pay the reduced amount by the deadline. If they process it too slow, I'm gonna have to pay the full tuition which is crazy high (I'm intl student) and I don't have that money right now. 

Also I'm in different country right now so I have let someone else pick up my document or I need to ship it internationally. I am just afraid I can complete everything before the deadline, Sep 15 so I don't pay the full tuition.

The Murders of 2 USC student  of Ming Qu and Ying Wu a few years back show the harsh reality of mixing Chinese Wealth in American Urban environments. USC is basically South Central LA. If you Los Angeles in areas you would understand how Watts, Inglewood etc can be dangerous of course.

m: “Two Chinese students were killed in Los Angeles because of showing off their wealth in a BMW.”



Mainly this is rich Chinese 

 authorities arrested five California residents on accusing them of helping Chinese nationals obtain student visas by taking their English proficiency tests for them.

Authorities allege the scheme was facilitated by 23-year-old Liu Cai, who entered the U.S. on a student visa to attend UCLA"

Between 16 units and a full-time job, I'm struggling to keep up this summer. Somehow, I've managed to maintain low As in all my classes, but I'm worried about an English final.

Anyway, my English final consists of 3 essays taken/written as an Online Canvas Quiz. I'm considering writing myself some basic notes, copying those notes (command+C) and then, once the quiz begins, pasting the notes in one of the essay boxes (command+V).

My Questions Are: If I did this, would Canvas know that I copy and pasted my notes. Also, is my Canvas screen visible to professors?

Are these clubs active at Davis?

Is it a close-knit community with bigs/littles/families or is it more individual participation?

Are they welcoming to ABC students or are some more exclusive to internationals?  Since the Facebook groups are mostly all in Chinese.

What are the differences between the groups?

I know most of you probably have housing by now but I figured I would still post this rant.

West Village is nothing short of a scam used to  siphon even more money from students. It’s overpriced, and not even  luxurious for the price you pay. Even if you have to live somewhere else and buy your own furniture, it’ll still be cheaper than this shithole.  It’s just not worth it, even if money is not an issue.   


Pros  
\- Decent gym(s) that are closer than ARC. No squat racks though  
\- Pool areas are nice   
\- Study areas   
\- Direct bus line  
\- The Hub (I guess??)  
\- In unit washer/dryer  
\- Game area  


Cons   
\-  You PAY TO PARK: I was trying to get parking after moving in and the  only place available was a 10 minute walk away from my house. Even  though there were tons of empty spots near my place, they were only I  was pretty mad because I was already paying so much to live there. I  tried to tell the lady It wasn’t fair, and she just gave me attitude.  Luckily one of the office ladies were nice and helped me find a loophole  by buying tandem spots that they weren’t technically supposed to give  to one person. Seriously... I shouldn’t have to park where I live as a  student anyway. That’s just stupid.   
\- SHITTY OFFICE STAFF: The  office staff suck. Going off the first point, a lot of the office staff  here are really dumb. The first person I had contact with in order to  try to get my lease replacement figured out was incredibly bad at  communication. He took forever to respond to emails about it. He finally  sent me a bunch of forms to fill out. After that he told me the forms  were wrong and that my mom had to fill out a couple pages. The worst  part is, the office RARELY picks up phone calls. Most times, calling the  office leads straight to voice mail because they’re “busy.” This made  the whole move in process quite difficult. On top of all this, the staff  are kind of unprofessional and would sometimes have random  conversations with themselves when you’re there trying to get help.  Every time you want to talk to an office member in person, be ready to  wait 5-15 minutes for them to be done working with others before you.   
\-  DIRTY ON MOVE IN: The apartment was DIRTY AF when I got it. I mean  seriously: dirt was absolutely caked on in a lot of places. The ceiling  fan and the bathroom were the worst. Dirt all over the baseboards and  weird yellow splotches on the bathroom door. Multiple other reviewers  have said this on different websites and it’s totally true. They even  had the gall to charge me $130 dollars for cleaning after I moved out  even though I had cleaned all that mess up.   
\- ROOM SIZE: The  apartment room isn’t that big. You can look for yourself according to  square footage within Davis, but you’re honestly going to save a lot and  get a better room in either north or south Davis by just moving into a  different complex and buying some used or IKEA furniture. On top of  that, your bedroom will still be bigger. Sure you might add a couple  minutes to your bike ride, but even West Village is a 10 minute bike  ride from Main campus. Not nearly as close as Sycamore Lane etc.   
\-  PARKING TICKETS: TAPS keeps a very constant eye on the entirety of West  Village. If you accidentally park in your neighbors spot, get ready to  cough up $60. If someone else parks in your spot, and you park in the  adjacent one that you know is empty—guess what? Ticket. I’ve even had  someone take my spot a couple times and not get a ticket while I have.  Oh, and if you have a permit, you’re not even supposed to park on the  street because of some weird rules UC Davis has on the land. Only at WV  can you get a ticket for parking in front of your house in Davis.   
\-  ANTS: Oh yea, even though these buildings are relatively new, we had a  major ant problem in our apartment. They were crawling out of the wall  and from the back of the sink. Luckily the maintenance staff are  actually very nice and took care of it, but I really didn’t expect that  type of problem when I was paying $1100+ to live there  
\- OVERPRICED:  The price. Just wow. The amount of stuff you get is nowhere what you pay  for. You get some furniture and a TV, yes, but is it really worth it?  Probably not, especially if you’re not the type to use the game room or  pools very often.   
\- SECURITY DEPOSIT: I was charged $130 for ""no  attempt to clean,"" which was insane because I cleaned the place myself  and it was in way better condition than I got it. When I tried to talk  to the lady calling me about final payments, she was super rude and even  accused me of breaking the lease just because I wasn't staying there  over the summer. If you ever do live here, make sure to notify them  within 48 hours that your room was dirty or they give 0 shits.  


TLDR: West Village is a scam for what you're paying. There are way cheaper places to live in Davis with better office staff."

It doesn’t seem like a sport beginners play. It seems as if most of the people have already played tennis is high school for 50+ hours. 

On the other hand, fencing is good because the people who know the secret aren’t in the club, it seems fun. It seems like the people in the club are homies. It seems as if no one has to have tried fencing before.

&amp;nbsp;

It's not to say that personalizing your space is the key to receiving a good grade and doing well in class, but it can help with your emotional well being to sort of ""project"" yourself onto the world around you and make a space ""yours"".

&amp;nbsp;

I know it's so easy to remain indifferent and apathetic and to lose interest in the material world, or to see it as superficial and meaningless, but it's so important to realize that *we* define what has meaning and what has value in this world, for ourselves.


&amp;nbsp;

 It's really hard to care about life and find success when we hold on to this attitude that nothing matters, so start the school year off right by inserting yourself into your surroundings. Put up posters and symbols and representations of the the things that are important to you on the walls and furniture. Bring some things that remind you of home and/or loved ones you'll be seeing less. For example, I'll be bringing several of my favorite rocks I've found, a blanket that has pictures of my dogs, a physics posters, bandanas of maps from places I've gone back packing to pin on the wall, and a bunch of other stuff.


&amp;nbsp;


Whatever it is, try to make your space look more like a manifestation of yourself, rather than a prison cell, and try to carry that attitude with you where ever you can. You and your life and your future are important, and if you act that way, you will begin to feel that way."

I didn’t enjoy my Davis orientation as much as the SoCal schools but Davis is closer to my house (just a few hours away) and it won’t be costly driving home comparing to flying. I think the things that were most appealing about UCSD and UCI were the weather and the fact that it was near the beach.

I decided I would choose Davis if I get my TAG accepted over my preference for environment because education&gt;beaches. I was wondering what else is there to do near campus that is fun? UCSD and UCI have beaches and UCI has Disneyland, but what does Davis have that isn’t too far from campus?

So there is no way for me to say this is a subtle manner but I’ve been experiencing extreme misery over the past week. Ive been masturbating up to 6 hours a day and consequently my reproductive organ is in miserable condition. I can’t get it to engage in its proper function. It is instead limp and slippery. Women have recently been making fun of me because my item is only 6 inches, which has caused me great distress. Although I may be 6 when I m excited, I am otherwise thinner and as thick as my toe. People keep making fun of this fact and it is causing me sorrow. Women hold their thumb and index finger close to one another in order to describe the size of my penis and it saddens me. I am aware that the average size is 6 inch but I think I’m like 5’11 technically. I know that women favor men with larger sizes and I don’t know how I am going to cope with this. Even most of my friends have larger sizes than me and it is miserable. Can someone please reassure me that 6 inches is good enough?"

So, I need help finding out how I can enroll in online classes at a UC, as a non-UC student. It can be any UC, any classes, as long as they're for credit.

I've already looked through the links the uconline page provides and haven't found what I'm looking for but maybe someone else will notice something I've missed, or know about a program I don't. I can't talk to and ask my counselor until Thursday, so I'm in a stressful rush to find somewhere to enroll.

It was a cold rainy day on February 13, 2006 in a portable building at the UC Davis College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences and I was 22 years old. It was my first day of work and I was sitting in a leaking, stale-smelling, cobwebbed covered room.  

I found a photo, logged in the back of a deep drawer and have kept this photo in my wallet since that very first day of work. The photo, known as 'Frog Lady', has haunted me - but the inscription has intrigued me beyond belief.  

If you recognize this woman, please let me know. She was either an undergrad student, graduate student, postdoctoral student or faculty member at UC Davis and most likely in the College of Ag, during the mid-1970s. 

In the posed photo, she is wearing three frogs - which represent 'Hear No Evil' 'See No Evil' 'Speak No Evil'. The inscription reads: ""December 22, 1976  The day I parted with the frogs...and you. Not good of me, not bad of the frogs the slide is better.""   

Please help me solve this mystery!!

d9rf68,"Question for CogSci majors: on the list of requirements, what is meant by ""any Upper Division Cognitive Science Course""?",https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/d9rf68/question_for_cogsci_majors_on_the_list_of/,DB6vi,4,2019-09-26 15:52:40,3,/r/UCDavis/comments/d9rf68/question_for_cogsci_majors_on_the_list_of/,NaN,"Does anyone here know what this means? When I declared CogSci as my major (BA) it was a few years ago, when the old requirements were still in place. I would like to graduate under the new requirements though. In the past, advisors told me that ""any upper division cognitive science course"" just meant any upper division course on the major requirement sheet - so, essentially the same courses used to satisfy ""Complete 12 additional units from Groups B-G"" (not sure why they didn't just say complete 16 units from B-G, but oh well). 

Now that the new requirements are in place, I'm a little paranoid that I've gotten something wrong and it's going to come back and bite me. This is my last year at UC Davis. When I was on Degree Check, the site made it seem like the ""any upper division cognitive science course"" requirement now means any upper division CGS course (when I was a freshman, I believe there was only one CGS course, which was CGS 01). Is this correct?

I also took one of my depth subject matter courses P/NP. I believe I was also told this would be fine, but again, with new requirements and whatnot I'm starting to get nervous. 

If someone could clarify, I'd really appreciate it."

Sociology 3 is I think the only other Honors course that fits in my schedule, but it is currently full. I originally signed up for it, but did not get it. (PSC 001 also works but it says it's only available to freshmen, and I'm a sophomore)

Anyway, if I can't get an internship that lets me go on Friday mornings what option do I have? I get kicked out of the Honors program if I don't take an Honors course, and I get kicked out of EDU 100 if I don't take the internship. I can't join SOC 03 either."

Was pretty keen on finishing this, until I realized the hell I had just put myself into - 19 - 20 units per quarter with two summer sessions that had 3 classes each in order to graduate on time. Grad on time is important here because if I trickle into next Fall quarter, I lose Blue and Gold scholarship and my parents pay an assload that I will never forgive myself for.

I switched to Psych major, with minor in man econ and applied computing + information systems. This workload still grads on time and is less hectic than the man econ and psych, believe it or not.   


I'm panicking currently because Idk if I made the right decision. I know that just a Psych B.A. doesnt do much for me in the field I love, which is therapy. I know I need a PsyD or a Master's to actually have my own clinic.   


I also know that without any experience before summer, i won't be able to get out of college and find a job very easily. It's going to suck, most likely. I was thinking about becoming a data analyst, but realized that the best way to do so is a data analyst bootcamp that costs way too much, cuts into my winter and spring schedule and makes it hell, and guarantees nothing.   


these feelings I had during the past winter quarter of my mind hitting the same brick wall over and over are coming back. I'm stuck. I desperately want to feel like I know what I'm doing and like I'm going to be okay, but I really can't. I'm cursed to feel like this. My mother deems my mindset - the kind that focuses on being happy with your work over having money as the #1 priority - as a common ""american"" and ""hippie"" mindset with ""low class"" standards. She's indian. She wanted me to be a doctor. She's always wanted me to make money.

At the same time, I know I'll want a lot of money for the dreams I want to accomplish while I'm young, like travelling and some small things and supporting my sister. But if I hate my job or don't like the ethics of it (data analysts pretty much support the idea of collecting data under people's noses, don't they?), I'm going to be panicking whenever I think about it. 

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry this is at the end of literally the first week of fall. I'm so sorry this is so jumbled and so gross looking. But I quite literally have no place left to go. My friends will feel uncomfortable, which I don't want to cause. My mother will give me a talk I don't agree with and don't want to hear. No one will help. I've also seen therapists, and #1. They have never ever understood me, so I've given up and #2. the ability for me to get a timeslot at the therapy services here at UCD are absolutely terrible, so I'm not going to even think about it.

additionally, thank you for taking the time out of your day to read. I'm sure many of you are busy with multiple things.

but yeah, I don't know what to do. I'm constantly panicking by the minute. even as I type this I don't know if I'm doing the right thing. but I don't know where else to turn."

At 2-2 after a brutal nonconference schedule, the Shredforce is ready to begin conference play by taking on one of the premier teams in the conference.

The Montana Grizzlies are hot at 3-1, but other than a game at Oregon they haven't had the challenge the Aggies had. (Last week, UCD lost in the [Fargodome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fargodome#Home_field_advantage), one of the loudest and most difficult venues in college football). However; don't count the Griz out; they are a perrenial upper-tier team in the Big Sky Conference and led the Ags for three quarters last year before our [bonkers comeback](https://www.espn.com/college-football/recap?gameId=401030394) in Missoula.

&amp;#x200B;

I predict an Aggie win, but this could be an exciting and close game. Here's everything you need to know:

**Time:** 1 PM Saturday, the 28th

**Venue:** UC Davis Health Stadium (may still be Aggie Stadium in online maps)

If you've never been, it's on La Rue Rd directly across the street from the cow facility. Only in UC Davis could we have directions like that to our football stadium 😑

**Tickets:** Free for students. They were handing them out earlier this week but if you don't have one you can probably walk up to the gate. I would come a little early though, as games are getting perilously close to actually reaching capacity.

**Giveaways:** Students are receiving free T-shirts and cowbells. Don't be surprised if you don't get your shirt right away -- it's bad form to just grab it and leave and so sometimes they put the giveaway later in the game to prevent that.

**Entertainment:** This game will be the inaugural performance of the new UC Davis Marching Band, which as of [a recent campus update](https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/statement-moving-forward-new-marching-band) has found staff and is ready to perform.

**TV/Stream:** [Root Sports](https://northwest.rootsports.com/) (no way around the the cable login requirement though)

**Audio:** KHTK, available on [Tunein](https://tunein.com/radio/Sports-1140-KHTK-s33038/)"

However, if I transfer to UC schools, I think I can pay reasonable cost while I'm studying what I want it. However, I heard CS is generally tough in any college, for instance if UW CS department make student weed out early, other colleges give admission relatively easily(just by fulfilling minimum requirement) but hard to graduate with the CS major. Is it true that UC students struggle to graduate with CS major, if so what kind of policy or task make you guys struggle?

It emphasizes relaxation, sensitivity, structure, and speed rather than force and strength. Wing Chun uses arm strikes, leg strikes, trapping and control techniques as part of its fighting arsenal. Legend has it that the style was created by a Shaolin nun named Ng Mui and was first taught to a young woman named Yim Wing Chun in order for her to defend herself against a local warlord. The art continued to be passed down hundreds of years later to famous masters such as Ip Man and Bruce Lee. Simple and easy to learn, practitioners become effective extremely quickly through Wing Chun’s unique and innovative teaching system.

**Fall 2019 practice times and locations are:**

Friday, Sunday 5-6:30pm ARC Martial Arts Room/Studio D

Yes, it’s a big school, and it’s easy to get lost. You’re in a new place and nobody knows your name, or you’ve been here but things have changed. You try to connect, but you don’t feel it. 

You are engaged in a difficult fight. You fight a concept that has the power to end relationships, careers, and lives. It causes hatred, addiction, and despair. It is abstract and pervasive.

You fight the shadow, loneliness.

No matter what stage of the process you’re at, there is work to be done. I know when I get lonely, 80% of the time it’s just the voice in my head telling me shitty things. It’s pretty persuasive. 

But that doesn’t mean it’s right. It’s your head. You decide what is real and what is not.

Connection is hard, yes. But there are other lonely people out there. The forces that have hijacked your brain to make you think you can’t connect are out there infecting other people too. This is depression and anxiety, this is phone and screen addiction, this is school and work stress. These are the forces of division that keep us isolated and isolating.

It’s your job to find someone who is even lonelier than you.

They are not easy to find, and harder still to bring together. And you will have to bring your A-game to persist, as the loneliness will try to corrupt you and shackle itself to you until you give up, even more defeated for having tried. 

Remember, your enemy is defeated by teamwork and teamwork alone. All successes are earned; all failures, practice.

You know the suggestions; talk to classmates, join a club, organize an event. Do these and more.

It is more important, though, that you do anything at all. This way, you won’t be alone: you’ll have you on your side. 

You will succeed, eventually. I promise. At the very least, a fellow lonely person may see your efforts and be inspired to endure for another day, and that day may make all the difference. You have not been spared to venom fangs of loneliness, but you can help others still.

Go forth, lonely Aggies, and find each other."

Francis and I had classes together, she introduced me to a whole new world of friends (that I still talk to), and had helped me overcome some challenges in my academic and personal life. I was always so happy to see her and to spend time with her. Shall I dare say, but Francis was my best friend at some point in time. However, in the past year or so, I've noticed some things about Francis that have turned me off. 

One of the academic challenges that I had to overcome was being put on Subject to Dismissal during my first year of college. It was a difficult time for me: adjusting to college, being away from home, having to put myself out there socially, dealing with a bad break up. And so, my grades suffered. Then, during my second year of college, I had a housemate who attempted suicide, and this put a huge hole in my motivation. However, about 3 months after the events, I lost 20 lbs (which was good  because I'm overweight), and landed two internships. Currently, I'm an employee at both of these places, having moved my way up from proving myself a worthy individual (lol). I wanted more for myself , despite the challenges I went through. I wanted to prove to myself that I could overcome and bounce back stronger. 

All the while, Francis was kind of stuck in the same place... and she wanted to be there. She's okay with settling. She's okay with ""the next best thing."" She isn't interested in self-growth. Not only that, I feel like our relationship is very 80/20, something I don't appreciate. I feel like I can be her rock, her emotional support, but she can't be mine. In times where I confided in her, she would revert the conversation to herself. I found that in these situations, I ended up comforting her instead of vice versa. I feel like I dont matter. 

I'm sad that my morals and values to really align with hers. That I'm moving forward while she's just ""okay"" with how she's doing. Is this me growing apart from her, or me just being a complete a*shole?"

Her: Mhm Hm... \*types it in or something (does cashier stuff)\*

Her: Would you like whip?

Me: Yes, \*continue staring\*

Her: Do you also want \[...\]?

Me: \*Say yes because she is so cute and how could I turn her down\*

Her: \*additional conversation\*

Me: \*just keep staring at her\* \*says thank you and then walks away\*

In that category, she looked good but I felt like she really liked me as she looked at me and it made me feel so good. I usually just stare at cashiers as I make an order because I want to show them that I am focused on them.

For example, I ordered from this guy at the CoHo the other time and I put my hands on the countertop and I leaned in so my face was close to his and I said my order. Then, another time, I just shouted out my order (not too loud). Then I was watching this other girl order and she seemed to just say her order calmly so I realized that I'm being dumb so I stopped. Then I adopted the facade of being old by speaking low energy, like I would say to her/him in a lethargic tone ""can i have a uhhhh... uhmm... one of those..."" but then I saw an old guy (probably a professor) stare at me as if I was an idiot so I stopped. Now, I just order normally but I always focus intently at the cashier. Like, I one time went to this rubios and ordered food from this girl and she looked so cute. She had this ponytail and she seemed to be latina and I don't know man just looking at her I felt as if she had this magical aura of kindness or friendliness and I don't really know how to gain it. The girl at the CoHo was looking at me without breaking eye contact and she seemed really intimate.

My reading of this is as follows:

Smoking is prohibited in any place where someone could conceivably breathe in secondhand smoke..so anywhere that's not a private residence.

Signs must be posted by owner/operator in places where you cannot smoke.

Complaints can be filed with the city.

Fines are 50, 200, and then 500 per conviction.

Also, if you're gonna make a left turn, it would be helpful to signal especially if you're in the left side of the lane (like you should be) so when you decide to hard break and not slow down while signalling (like you should be) we aren't caught off guard and have to break too just because your dumbass decided that you're the only person biking around you.

I had a lot of friends graduate last spring, and i heard a lot from them about how annoying, or even difficult, some of the costs were. i'm trying to figure out how other people in my situation deal with extra costs on top of those and still find a way to celebrate graduating. im not looking for pity here but am really desperate for advice or resources that might help me

&amp;#x200B;

my parents situation:

\- neither work, disabled, on SSI. too many health issues to count. i send them money every month to help them get by for when something breaks and for food. they havent paid a cent towards my education since middle school, when i realized how bad of a state they were in financially and stopped letting them. 

my own situation:

\- barely getting by with 2 jobs + loans, i have lost any shame i used to have about asking profs/departments for help getting class materials on a limited budget. unfortunately i am rarely able to visit my family due to the costs associated with travel (they live in southern CA) and getting time off work hurts us all financially. 

 i am proud i was able to make it to the point where i'm thinking about graduation, but because of our financial situation i know i'll end up paying *everything* myself. i'm trying to figure out how others have approached this. 

  
i assume graduation expenses, outside of the damn cap and gown fees and whatever costs there might be to graduate will include: paying for a rental car for my parents to drive up here (their car is too run down to handle long drives), a hotel for them to stay in for at least 2 nights due to their health concerns (i have too many housemates to let them stay here, it feels so rude to ask and where would they sleep??), paying for several peoples meals for a couple days, and others i bet i havent even considered yet. its daunting, and i am scared ill have to tell my parents i cant afford to help them get here for my graduation. maybe i won't even walk because i cant afford it, and honestly after all ive done to get here... that'd suck. it matters to me. i paid for most of these costs to get family here twice before, for orientation and move in day, and depleted a lot of savings doing so. i'm not sure i can do it again, even 3 years later. 

anything helps, thanks. if you're in a similar situation.. i sympathize. you're not alone."

Their methodology can be aggressive at times as they take the Gospel to the World. One motto that was popular when I served was “Move with the movers” which should give you an idea of their mentality, and which may give the impression that they are a cult. But my years on Staff were fulfilling and exciting as I took the Gospel into very remote and dangerous areas in my trusty Toyota Cruiser. But Cru can be quite rigid on purpose to maintain the quality and control of their message. So it’s not for everyone, but it might be just where you will want to serve God."

All that would be fine if the people in my dorm weren’t so damn cliquey and petty. Also so far nobody can seem to understand that it’s rude to storm into a room yelling and talking loudly and refusing to quiet down when people are obviously trying to study, especially when the only options to study nearby are just our room, the common room, and the Regan Main. Not to mention the wifi doesn’t even work in Regan Main! And the only kitchen is this tiny corner of Regan Main, while some Tercero halls have a big ass Ikea kitchen on their first floor.

All my friends are in Tercero which has such nice building arrangements and layout to promote both studying and socializing, such nice RAs and building-mates. And since it’s like a mile away I always have to bike there, and since they’re hanging out 24/7 they all get so much closer and I feel like a stranger.

This could be staying or even not being able to graduate despite stating in orientation the exact requirements needed to graduate.

Details:

1. There are three options to obtain a degree: project, thesis, or exam. You cannot change the way you obtain your degree once you have declared which path. This issue affects people who are taking the exam route.
2. Previously, if you were a graduate student, you would not need to take an exam as long as you got A's in three core classes. These classes would be in systems, application, theory, or architecture.
3. Now, graduate students that have been at the school for a year and are trying to graduate this upcoming school year are forced to take an exam even if they met the requirement of getting A's.

Thoughts:

1. This is unfair as people have planned their schedule around the information that was given since starting the program.
2. The exam is a common exam, not based on the classes people took, as everyone has taken different classes for their graduation requirements.
3. Had people known this, many graduate students have expressed they would have chosen a different route.

Any advice on how to handle this?"

My name is Carter and I’m a freshman living in Tercero this year. I wanted to advertise this to as many people as I could so I figure Reddit would be a good place to do that.

-- I’m offering free bike service to anyone who has any bike trouble. The only catch is that if a part is needed, you fulfill the cost for the part but labor/instillation is free! I can help with anything as small as replacing a popped tire o adjusting breaks to something bigger installing a back rack or new breaks (with some research first xD) —

** DISCLAIMER** I am not a professional and I do not have specific training in bike maintenance! I have experience working on my own bike and have done major work on my car at home. Though I may not be able to provide a professional service, I am here to give as much help as I can to those with limited knowledge on bikes or time do work on it, without paying a high price tag for professional work to be done!!

// Contact me through Instagram (@soopersmash) if you want me to take a look or need some advice //

I know a fair amount about bikes and I enjoy working on mine, so I hope to spare some college students from expensive service fees on a campus transportation necessity. 

If you’ve read this far, thank you! And if you have any bike trouble, or know anyone who could use a hand or some tools, reach out! I’d love to lend a helping hand the best I can. I also have a fairly open class schedule so scheduling conflicts should hopefully remain minimal. 

My main goal with this is to help/educate people enough to be able to work on their own bikes, as I find many people don’t know where to start with their bikes. And the more people who know what to do, the more people they can teach!

(Also, (you know I had to plug this) I will accept and greatly appreciate any tips for labor as I am also a broke college student myself but I mainly want to openly lend help to those in need. You are in no obligation and have no expectation at all to do so, this is a free service! But I didn’t want to  remove that option)"

I just found out that the OChem series I had taken at a different college will only count as CHE 118A here in Davis. As a fourth year Biochem student, this definitely screws up with my schedule and my plan to graduate in the spring, so i'm kind of at a loss right now. Not only do I have to take 8 more additional units, but it's been so long since I took OChem so I would be taking the rest of the series with close to zero background.

Has anyone been in a similar situation that could maybe shed some light on what steps I should do? Or does anyone have any insight or advice? Is it possible to petition or argue the evaluation decision? 

As a non-traditional transfer student, I'd actually like to finish my degree on time this time. But it seems like I won't and it's both frustrating and disappointing. 

Note: I already have an appointment scheduled with an advisor, but I just need more immediate feedback, etc.

Long-time lurker here but first post here. I was going to use a throwaway but I felt that if I wanted to try to do something like this, then it wasn't the time to be shy about it!

I read a lot of posts about people feeling like they don't click well with other people, and being someone in their fourth and final year here, I have to say that I've strongly had the same share of experiences and many of the people that I have talked to and bonded with have felt the same thing. Even though I am in my fourth year and have managed, though not content with my experience here, I think that it would be nice for people to be able to kind of be able to kind of find people in common with, somewhat of a... friendly megathread... reddit friend tinder...? Because let's be real, sometimes you can try really hard and go to clubs, events, etc. and sometimes things just don't work out, and it isn't because there's something wrong with anyone, but it's just sometimes it is literally /just hard/ to be able to find people who click.

This isn't a guaranteed method of making friends, but I think that it might be nice to give it a try anyways, so I can start\~

**Name:** Jin**Year:** Fourth year, graduating Jun 2020**Likes:** Anime... (Not a part of DAC though), I like drawing anime stuff and my own personal goal for drawing is to be able to make cute things like stickers, charms, postcard prints and be able to run a charity line using some of my art to help disabled animals and black cats. I like horror a lot. I also like video games. My favorites right now are Fire Emblem 3 Houses, Nier Automata, always a fan of Doki Doki Literature Club but I recently played some other games that I have mixed feelings about (like Detroit Become Human). I also play many tap-tap games like Love Live! and Bang Dream. Dark humour, I love memes, especially stupidly cursed images. [This is literally my favorite video right now and I honestly do not fucking understand my own sense of humour sometimes.](https://twitter.com/cursedemojis/status/1179077742463193095) Cosplay is cool too.**Dislikes:** Politically and social insensitivity... Sorry but I just don't click with people who think that politics or bringing social awareness to the table is a joke. :T People who rag on me for cussing, I drop the fuck-word pretty often and I probably just can't vibe with someone who can't take dark humour or cursing dshfhasdnf.**Ideal Hang-out:** Small gathering, I like to drink casually (honestly not even that hard, my favorite are those Smirnoff thingies) and have fun, but I also like chilling with people like one-on-one like gaming next to each other and just saying ""Hey Jin look at this shitty meme I came across on reddit"" or literally like 5 people in the same room watching TV or cards against humanity. Going out is fun too, I'm semi-athletic and like to do outdoors stuff like river-rafting. More of a city girl and an independent traveler, favorite city is San Francisco. I LOVE MOM FRIENDS. I love being able to share insecurities and feelings and all of that wholesome shit. I am like an older sister type to many but also a little sister type to many.**I would like to try:** watching Promare. Playing video games with other people, like sort of a stream but not really, like I legitimately enjoy playing a game like a story-based game and we all just crowd around and scream at reactions and stuff like that. It would also be really cool to do something like play a multiplayer game like Mario Party, SSB, Monster Prom, etc.

It is nice to meet you\~ I hope that I can meet some of you too\~

Hit me up if you would like to play Doki Doki Literature Club or some story based game (like Life is Strange, etc.) and allow me to work on stuff while I watch you play (it is one of my main fandoms). I hope that many of you can use this and maybe even incorporate it later on!"

Your feelings matter and we're not in some type of ""who's life is worse"" competition.

There's no extra cost. Even if you dont use SHIP, you can schedule an appointment and see the counselors. I recommend going online to see what the difference counselors specialize in so that you can get a better feel for who you wanna see!"

If you don't like reading controversial stuff, then don't read below. 

**Context:** 

2nd year engineering (M)

**Detail:**

So, I've been speaking with a few individuals at this school and I find that I don't 'click' with anyone because we don't have shared mutual interests, so here are mine:

* Philosophy 
* Economics (very little)
* Politics
* Foreign policy

Warning: libertarian rambling below.

**More Detail**

So, I've decided to give some selections regarding what my viewpoints are:

Philosophy:

* reality exists, man can perceive reality, reason is the means of perceiving reality, we have free will
* God doesn't exist, faith is immoral
* mysticism and totalitarianism are linked; for example, Nazi Germany primarily resulted because of Christian faith/self-sacrifice (Plato)
* rights belong to man because man can reason, non-human animals have no rights
* rights are the property of individuals
* taxation is immoral

Economics

* The mixed-economy results in racism. Since people have to create political unions to organize for 'rights,' they do so on grounds related to race. Thus, the lack of free markets encourages racism.

Politics:

* I believe hate speech is free speech
* there shouldn't be as many regulations. for example, there should be no American Medical Association, which is just a cartel. People should be able to receive surgeries from people who have no experience at all so long as they consent
   * corporations 'buy' the gov. to grant them favors. regulations are used by the wealthy to keep competition down.
* cocaine, suicide,etc should all be made legal (although I think of them as immoral)
* i support clean energy but environmental policy would unintentionally harm the poor so I'm against it
* I believe gun rights are a technicality but today gun violence is just a means of political demagoguery
* not planning to vote during the next election. 
* democracy is not inherently good. an ideal gov. would be more akin to a confederacy
* universities should be privatized and deregulated to lower cost and increase quality

Foreign Policy

* should cut military funding by over 70%
* should return from middle east
* unsure regarding israel/palestine. support peaceful resolution.

Social

* racism is bad but those who seek to punish racism have gone the wrong route (I believe in forgiveness and sympathy as a means of ending racism, not totalitarianism)
* i think that women should have the ability to have an abortion during the first trimester. second tri. is a technicality. third should be illegal.
* immigration is a technicality. moderation"

This is a throwaway account because I am genuinely afraid of the university retaliating against students who speak against China. Two Americans on American soil have already been silenced for speaking out against China, and I have a feeling that number is going to go up.

But the very least you could fucking do is check that someone isn't ALSO trying to fly by in the left ""lane"" or left half of our traffic direction. It's just basic fucking common sense. These fuckers probably haven't ever driven before or something. God damn it. Also FUCK this cruisers who just bike at 8 miles per hour in the middle of the fucking big ass road oblivious to there surroundings just looking at the fucking sky like blissful idiots.

* If you live in the dorms:
   * Every morning and every night, write statements in support of the Hong Kong protests on your floor's whiteboard.
   * Tape printed signs in support of the Hong Kong protests (bonus points if you include images of Chinese police violence and of the peaceful protestors, including the woman whose eye was shot out by police and the man whose head was crushed into the cement.)
   * Get a pen (preferably washable, Crayola is a good brand for that) and write messages in support of the Hong Kong protests on the bathroom stalls.
   * Leave a big sign in your window in support of the Hong Kong protests. It's safer if you live on a higher floor, I wouldn't advise doing it if you live on the ground level.
* If you live in an apartment or house:
   * Leave a sign in support of the Hong Kong protests in your window(s). And don't just set them there--make sure that even if someone breaks in and tries to remove it, they'll have a really hard time doing it (use Elmer's glue perhaps?)
* If you have a front yard:
   * Post a sign in your yard that is in support of the Hong Kong protests. Show images of police violence and peaceful protest. Chances are people will try to remove, damage, or steal it. To prevent this:
      * make sure the sign is made of some sort of sturdy metal, like steel or aluminum. 
      * Coat the back of the sign and the stakes at the bottom with tree sap or something equally sticky. Any attempts to steal or remove the sign will result in extremely sticky hands, and if they try to put it in their car it will get all over their car!
      * If you can't get access to something sticky, vaseline will work and make the sign extra slippery so they can't get a good grip on it.
* If you have a roof:
   * Put a reaallyy big sign on your roof. It's really hard not to get caught climbing on someone else's roof to remove a giant sign, and even if they get the sign off, it would be too big for them to dispose of or steal without getting caught.
* Things you can do elsewhere:
   * Write things in support of Hong Kong protests using sidewalk chalk in areas around the dorms, in the street outside your apartment or house, and pretty much everywhere with cement on the ground. It's impossible to get rid of without hosing it down, and it won't go away until it rains, which--in California--doesn't happen often.
   * Say things like ""Stand for Hong Kong"" or ""support Hong Kong protests"" using duct tape on public boards and on walkways. Duct tape is extremely difficult to remove from flat surfaces without something to scrape it up or dissolve the adhesive.
   * Wear clothing in support of the Hong Kong protests, such as hats, shirts, shorts, jeans, dresses/skirts, pajamas, shoes, socks, anything really.
   * Put bumper stickers on your car or bike in support of the Hong Kong protests. Bumper stickers have extremely strong adhesive that is nearly impossible to remove.

Next **Wednesday October 16, 2019** at **2:00PM** I will be standing at the Coffee House patio in order to protest against the silencing of Pro-Hong Kong ideas, posters, etc. I plan on standing there with a homemade paper poster for all to see, both those who support and are against the Hong Kong protests. 

**I invite anyone who wishes to be part of this to join me with posters and, most importantly, your voice.** 

Some poster ideas can be found in this Google Drive link \[GRAPHIC VIOLENCE AHEAD\]: [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ADEwyApwcCfWWtuingnfshN0oS9D-ZaC). 

Although there has been a previous post on alternative ways to show support for Hong Kong ([Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/dfnaop/ideas_for_supporting_the_hong_kong_protests/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)), I think people should physically show that we support the Hong Kong pro-Democracy protests. Posters are powerful methods of spreading a message and creating a space for dialogue, but to support such discourse ***WE, THE STUDENT BODY***, are a valuable for showing our support.

To show support and spread the word, I have created a Facebook event page. PLEASE feel free to share this event and spread it around, we must show everyone who we are as students at the University of California, Davis: [https://www.facebook.com/events/390209534981368/](https://www.facebook.com/events/390209534981368/)

**IF YOU WISH TO JOIN, PLEASE:**

* Do not voice out racist, xenophobic, or other offensive rhetoric (examples of such can be found in the comment sections of this post: [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/dfmd6y/video_of_chinese_students_ripping_off_the_poster/)). 
* Be aware that this could draw negative reactions from individuals. This could be through speech or physical contact. It is my hopes that we can all avoid any physical conflicts at all costs.
* There was a previous post by another U.C. Davis student asking for ideas to support Hong Kong protests without being retaliated against. I fully understand where this student is coming from, it can be scary to swim against the current. *I, for once, am not afraid*. Although I will be at the protest wearing a bandana and a green cap I am not afraid to show who I am to the campus.

The riot in Hong Kong has lasted for nearly four months and as a person who lives in Hong Kong for twenty years, I am so hurt to see my hometown has turned into a place of ruin, despair and violence. Everyday, the social orders are being trampled and destroyed. Demonstrators set fires on the streets, grabbed sticks from the police and used them to beat up the police force. Bricks and Molotov cocktails were being thrown to the police.  These protests are no longer peaceful anymore, but violent and bloody actions that are threatening the future of Hong Kong. To subsidise the protests, the government has revoked the Extradition Law. However, the demonstrators did not retreat, but continued deteriorating the whole situation by more violent and radical actions. Personal information of the some police officers were exposed and posted online, and their family members are facing anonymous threats every day; Railway systems were destroyed and even innocent residents were physically attacked just because they expressed their fury verbally towards the protesters. Have you seen ""peaceful"" demonstration like this? However, some irresponsible media are trying to portray the whole thing as peaceful and justified: they posted videos and images that show how police attacked the protesters. However, in case of illegally occupying streets and destroying social orders, in most western democratic countries police would use some violence to maintain the social orders and protecting themselves. Don't forget just a few months ago how the police in France repressed the demonstrators by far more intense force. And don't forget demonstrators were beaten up to bleeding in Wall Streets in 2011. And don't forget the how students were pepper sprayed in UC Davis Campus. However, some people are just pretending they are blind and these incidents did not happen. If you are someone with rationality, please make wise decisions and stop being indoctrinated by bias, rumours and lies. If you love peace and rule of law, please say to no to violence and riots in Hong Kong please. Thank you! 如果你係支持遊行既香港人 唔該你停一停 諗一諗 你地咁樣做 究竟係保護緊香港 定係傷害緊佢？

Is your goal really protesting against a totalitarian government or just trying to trigger some international students from China to do some stupid things? From many of the posts here, the latter unfortunately seems to be the more popular scernario. If you want to avoid being the latter, you need to understand the relationships between people from mainland China and Hong Kong and what’s causing all of these disputes. When you just blindly pick a side and attacking the other side without knowing the other side’s reasoning, you are no different from the side you’re against. 

Relationships between mainlanders and Hong Kongers involves more history than what most people in the western world here can think of. If you think HK is or can be an independent country, you have a lot more to research on before going out and protest on the matter. To understand what’s going on, you have to know a brief history of China (To avoid ambiguity, “China” refers only to the region not any political power). Hong Kong had always been no different from the rest of the cities in China until the late 1800s when the government at the time (Qing dynasty) leased out HK to Great Britain for 99 years due to corruptions. Fortunately for HK, GB was able to bring its modern technology  and human capitals to make HK the city with a GDP higher than the rest of mainland for decades. Because of this, many HK residents found themselves to be superior over mainlnders and derogory terms had been created for mainlanders as well. Mainlanders at the time accepted their inferiority in some ways because average HK residents were indeed having much better quality of life and have the dream lives these mainlanders strive to achieve. After Chinese Communist Party taking control of China (~1950), China eventually was able to catch up economically in the late 90s with Beijing, Shanghai, and some other major cities closing the gaps further each year between HK in terms of GDP. These cities inevitably attracted foreign investors, and HK, a city that had been the port to the Chinese market for foreign investors, started to lose its role. In 1997, the lease of HK between GB and China which is now PRC finally expired, and HK was offiically handed over to the PRC with a few conditions, including keeping the economical and political systems for the next 70 years. In recent years, PRC had been able to thrive economically, especially in the major cities, and offers great investment opportunity for foreign corporates. At this point, HK has lost the role that it had. External factors did help PRC to thrive, but to a majority of the Chinese people, it’s mostly due to CCP’s effort. Many people who were only able to have barely enough money for food now are able to afford plane tickets for traveling. The Chinese people became proud of themselves and no longer found themselves to be inferior economically. Unfortunately, rapid economical improvement does not neccesaeily lead to  advancement in education. Many who became rich did not necrssarily receive proper education (which is one of the reasons that caused the stereotype of Chinese tourists), and they know this. They also believe they are inferior educationally because they see western education as the gold standard.  


Why does this matter? Well, many residents in HK know this, too, and therefore see mainlanders as inferior “savages.” With the help of the stereotypical Chinese tourists and the infamous Milk Scandal where mainlanders went to HK and bought so much baby powder that HK residents could not even buy any for their own children, mainlanders earned themselves new derogotory terms from the HK residents. However, mainlanders no longer accepted themselves being inferior like in the mid 1900s because of economical improvement; **mainlnd Chinese start seeing HK residents as bigots who discriminate against mainlanders simply because they are from mainlnd China.** With the help of CCP propaganda and state media censorship, the hatreds towards HK residents are magnified. **Whenever western national flags, especially UK’s, are flown by HK protestors, mainland Chinese would see these protestors as traitors and separitists who would rather become UK nationals or even Caucasians than being Chinese because these traitors see Chinese as an inferior race.** However, the actual protestors who flew those flags might just want to use these flags as symbols of democracy. People on the internet never argue with logics. When mainlanders telling HKers to suck Uncle Sam’s dick and lick Queen’s pussy, HKers see mainlanders as inferior savage who hates democracy and loves sucking Winnie’s weenie. 

At this point, it doesn’t matter what HKers are protesting about. Mainlanders who are against HK protests already have biased opinions towards the protestors even before the protests begin: You fly UK flags to symbolize democracy? Nah, you’re just trying to separate from China and discriminate against Chinese. You are angry about the goverment? Oh yeah understandable since you pathetics will never be able to afford your own home and will have to live inside your cage homes for the rest of your lives. 

Now guess what you can achieve by intentionally triggering international students with just the texts “free hong kong” **without providing any logical arguments**? Well, the only thing will be achieved is making them hate HKers more while thinking you’re just some SJW who wants HK to be independent after reading one blog post on Buzzfeed. 

TL;DR: Please, if you’re going to protest against a totalitarian government, dont attack its supporters. Instead, provide logical evidence to convince them to join you."

Is this a good idea?

A little background, I've already taken ENL3 and am currently enrolled in a few English courses for the fall quarter. I've also been eyeing the requirements for both of the majors. The English major requirements don't seem to be tooooo overwhelming, and I heard that lots of English majors actually choose to double major in something else because they still need to take more units after they finish the English requirements. I plan on talking with the English department advisor.

Worst case scenario, I major in MechE and minor in English, instead of pursuing the double major.

I know that it's in my best interest to graduate in 4 years, and in all honesty, I would prefer not to stay here longer than I need to, as in I would like to not have to take a 5th year. I'm also a little wary of taking summer sessions since I'd rather be working or taking an internship, but I would not be opposed to them.

There's also a lot of other factors going in, like GEs, but I'm hoping that I'll be able to knock all of them out IF I double major.

The motive to major in English is more personal, not so much related my career prospects, although I do know that there are benefits to having backgrounds in both STEM and Humanities/SS when it comes to the employment field. For the most part, I'd like to learn as much from the English department as possible so as to further my own goals, and I feel like I could learn a lot more about the study pursuing the major instead of the minor. But again, worst case scenario, I'm perfectly fine with a minor.

Essentially, if I can double-major in both without losing my sanity, I will. I just want to know if it's possible and/or incredibly difficult. Will I have to grind really hard, will I have to take ~5 classes per quarter, will I have to give up my will to live, etc.

(But apparently I couldn't? I guess it's on me too but the professor also wouldn't grant me a PTA because they said the class wasn't required for my major...so I believed them both. The PTA was something both the peer and head advisor told me to request end of Fall 2018). I was told Winter by that peer advisor that I would be set to graduate after summer, so I crammed my last classes then. Probably should have requested to meet again with head advisor but this has been a nightmare.

Went in person to file for graduation in August, they told me no news is good news and that if there were any issues they would contact me before fall quarter started. They did not contact me until a few days ago and I'm at a loss.

Is there anything I can do in this situation, or do I just have to suck it up and come back in the winter to take one more class (and a filler to reach 6 units probably)? My department head advisor was not sympathetic when I explained my situation, so I assume I'm out of luck...

Sorry if this was hard to read, I'm really bummed out. Commuting sucks, and I had to pay out of pocket some to try and finish in the summer too and I was looking to apply to state, but looks like I should wait for the spring cycle now. :( I know what I should have done, but I feel like it's still unfair.

I was walking in the opposite direction. This happened about a year ago.

I used to carry a wallet which I would put maybe $20 in as well as my bicycle keys. I did not put any condoms in the wallet at the time because I never really came close to engaging in the act of fornication. I was sort of a shy dude so I never really expected an opportunity to arise. Occassionally, I would run out of money so I would run to the ATM and withdraw the money although I did this not too often. I did pay for instance for my roommates to own a fridge and a micro wave. I once ate out with this group of friends and this girl next to me dropped her fork and I picked it up for her. She did not remunerate me for my time.

 I would carry my wallet in my left pocket. I have the habit of placing my hand in my left pocket and rubbing my pocket in order to make sure that the key has not fallen out of the wallet. Because of the material of the wallet, I have to rub quite a bit.

During this incident, I was walking and I decided to rub my wallet to make sure my key had not fallen out. As I walked, a girl was walking in the opposite direction. I'd say that she was around shorter than 6 feet and she was probably wearing jeans and a shirt that was not colored black or yellow. I'm 6 feet myself and I'd specify by saying that she was probably pretty short. Maybe she was 5'6. She wasn't as short as Bagel Boss guy.

Anyways, I eventually looked upwards toward her as I was still rubbing my wallet and her eyes were fixed on the area of my pants which contained my wallet. She sort of stared and then I stopped and just kept my hand in my pocket the whole time because the entire event lasted only maybe 4 seconds. Then, she looked up towards me. I think that she misperceived my action and had thought that I was rubbing my... you know what. She just looked, not smiling or mad, just observing me, sort of like a disappointed parent after you accidentally flush the goldfish down the toilet.

As of currently, I just carry my keys in my pocket without a wallet. In fact, I usually don't carry a wallet. During penis inspection day, my priest was asked me what I carried in my wallet. I got scared because he was gonna check it to see if I broke abstinence but he didn't check it because he didn't think that I could get some even if I tried. My sisters were treated a different way.

Anyways, I apologize to the girl whom I accidentally did this to."

When it gets to my turn and just when she's about to ask me what I'd like for today, she asks me if my dog is a service dog. I'm like no but I am just getting food to go and I'm holding him, and she goes your dog can't be here. I was so pissed so I left the place. I am angry not because my dog can't be inside chipotle, but because she saw me waiting in line but didn't say anything UNTIL I was just about to get food. I know I am at fault, I know I shouldn't bring a dog in, and if she's so strict about ""no dog allowed"" rule, then she should have told me once I stepped in and I would have been totally fine with it.

I feel like I can't cram all of those in a few days... 

Do you think i should drop this class and take an easier GE class like word root?"

As the event approaches I would like to remind everyone of the etiquette for the rally:

* We are to remain *non-violent* throughout the event. If we are approached by counter-protesters - which we may, we must all remain calm.
* **Dress Code:** We ask that, if you can, dress ***ALL IN BLACK***. This is to show support for the Hong Kong protesters who have adopted ***BLACK T-SHIRTS*** to contrast white t-shirts worn by Beijing supporters.
* If you can, ***PLEASE BRING POSTERS!*** Big cardboard and paper posters are great for attracting people's attention. We have some quotes and poster ideas in the following Google Drive (GORE/VIOLENCE AHEAD): [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ADEwyApwcCfWWtuingnfshN0oS9D-ZaC](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ADEwyApwcCfWWtuingnfshN0oS9D-ZaC)
* We encourage any residents or non-residents of Hong Kong, Mainland China, etc. to bring facial masks and eye cover. We understand that safety is a concern and we encourage everyone to take the steps necessary to keep yourself and your family safe!

Agenda:
1. Present statement to urge his support of the bill
2. Pass the petitions to his representative

Hong Kong Democracy and Human Rights Act imposes economic sanctions on responsible Hong Kong and Chinese officials by freezing their and their family’s assets in US and denying their entry VISA. The bill also make clear that VISA applicants shall not be denied on the basis of arrest in nonviolent protest for democracy, human rights and rule of law. Lastly, the bill requires the President and Department of State to assess Hong Kong autonomy status annually and issue strategy protecting US business and citizens in Hong Kong.

Here's the weird bit.

I was bitten by a mosquito this morning--I felt the bite, looked down at my hand and saw the mosquito, swatted at it, missed and it got away.

I was thinking, damn, now my hand is going to itch all day.

It's been 3 1/2 hours. No swelling, no itching. Nothing. After a little research, itchy mosquito bites are a result of an allergic reaction to the mosquito's saliva. But I didn't have the histamine reaction typically associated with allergies.

So... am I simply not having a histamine response? What could cause this?"

It may be normal that after graduating you miss it which is the case for me. But I’m now 2+ years removed and I still miss the area like crazy. Idk if anyone feels like this but I miss the small city feeling, the bikes, the food, etc. Maybe I still miss it a lot because I have not found like a set job like others have and I still have plans to get my masters.

I was in Sacramento earlier this year for 4 months doing an internship. I definitely took advantage of my time there and got an ARC membership so I would go every day to workout and play. Then seeing how some people from my years still go play or were in the area was great. Obviously it is not the same since there are new faces but it was still a great feeling being up there  enjoying Sac and Davis, eating at my fav spots etc.

Since graduating I’ve worked in San Antonio for a year (which I really liked) and had to move back to LA after a year (it was an americorps position in San Antonio). I am from and grew up in LA and I hate it here because it is just too packed and expensive and I think what I really liked about Sac/Davis was that it was way less of that there. After struggling for months finding something when I moved back to LA I got that internship in Sac which I loved doing and learned so much which was immigration, specifically citizenship.  after my internship was over I got an immigration position in LA and I love the work. But again too much traffic and all. I definitely enjoyed and needed those 4 months in Sac/Davis because I missed it like crazy

I still miss it like crazy and I hope to (if I stay in California) live in that area if there are immigration position open in non profits, schools, etc in the near future or after I get my masters in a few years.

I know we all have different experiences at Davis but for those who are enjoying it currently, keep enjoying it! It is a great small city with a small kinda town feeling to it. The food is great. It is beautiful there. I will always have fond memories of that place. Good luck Aggies

If you rip off others’ posters, censor others’ opinion, or make verbal attack because of your feeling, you’re retarded. 


Hey y’all. I’m that mainland student again who did an AMA. You can look into my post history where I believe it shows that Im in a quite neutral position regarding the HK movement, and I think my experience as someone from mainland can give you an indepth view of the side that you don’t usually see — the side of mainland Chinese students. The majority of mainland Chinese students do not support and are against the movenment in HK for two main reasons to my knowledge, and I will go over each one of them and explain why they see it that way. 

1. They believe HK protest is a violent separatist movement that’s trying to make HK an indepedent country.

They view it this way mainly due to how the protests are displayed by the state media. The state medias show footage of police and mainland Chinese getting beaten up by masked protesters, pictures of protesters waving British national flags, videos of protesters damaging the public properties, and more. Did these things really happen? Likely yes. Did they do it just because they are violent thugs? Probably no. Do they make up the majority of the protesters? Likely no. However, the state medias use this footages to paint the protest to be about HK independence and mentions nothing about the five demands. Many of you asked in the AMA why HK independence is a bad thing and why it angers mainland Chinese so much. HK independence is a highly sensitive topic due to two things. First, it is just not possible in anyway. HK has no military of its own, is in the middle of mainland China, and has its infrastructures, such as power plants and water reservoirs, are all in mainland.  Second, it’s due to history of HK. HK was a colony leased to the British in 1800s, and the lease has always to be seen as a shame over the entire Chinese race because it shows how weak Chinese were and how Chinese were treated like slaves that would just give out their territory for opium. Fortunately for people in HK, British brought in a western democratic system, trades, and modern technology, which improved the economy by a sustantial degree. This sounds pretty positive, but it leads to the next reason that mainland Chinese dislikes the movement.

2. Many mainland Chinese believe HKers see them as an inferior race.

Under British rule, HK exceeded PRC (People’s Republic of China, aka mainland China) economically by a huge amount with its GDP being higher than PRC for decades. Because of this, many mainland Chinese immigrated to HK, and as what usually happens during a period that had a lot of immigration, discrimination and xnophobia happens. Mainland immigrants were given derogatory terms, such as “阿燦”, “大陸哩”, “大陸仔”, “支那人”, etc (you have to google them since each one has a history). Later during the infamous Chinese Milk Scandal, many mainlanders went to HK to buy milk powder for their children because they lost trust in Chinese brands. They bought so much that many HKers couldn’t even buy for their own because they were OOS. This brought mainland Chinese a new derogotary term, “locusts.” And of course, the state media reported all of this to the mainland Chinese to show them how HKers see them as inferior. 

(Below is a personal experience that I first hesitated to include because I could be biased due to many factors, but i tried my best to write it as close to what happened as possible. Sample size of encounters is not large either where N ≈ 15)

When I went to HK over several ocasions,  i found some really consistant patterns of how people treated me. I do not speak Cantonese, so I have to use Mandarin or English. Although HKers dont speak mandarin, they use very similar written language as mainland (traditional vs simplified Chinese). Because of this, I would type out things in traditional Chinese and show it to then. All of the questions pretty mich started with “hi, sorry for bothering. I’m from mainland and can’t speak Cantonese. Can you show me how to ...”. With this method, people most of the time responded in a really cold manner without any facial expression. I was just thinking maybe it was just that HK is a busy city and everyone is in a hurry until I started asking questions in English. Whenever I asked in English, people tend to smile a lot and respond my questions patiently. I am not the only one who have had this experience and was surprised when one of my friends bought up experience of his in a conversation where he found this pattern, too. Was it due to xenophobia or the bad stereotypical image of mainland tourists? Maybe. Was it just due to HKers feel more comfortable with English than mandarin? Perhaps. But one thing for sure was that I felt uncomfortable with identifying myself as someone from mainland and many people in China see this as discrimination.


Because of these, many mainland Chinese have a very biased view on anything that HKers do. Even if they did know the five demands, it would still be difficult to make them support the movements because of this nationalism and ethnicity related bias."
djcagf,Pro-Chinese Government Propaganda in this Sub and on Campus: Observations and Patterns,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/djcagf/prochinese_government_propaganda_in_this_sub_and/,UCDontDoxMeBro,283,2019-10-17 13:34:25,50,/r/UCDavis/comments/djcagf/prochinese_government_propaganda_in_this_sub_and/,NaN,"**Introduction**

In the many discussions in this sub regarding the pro-freedom protests in Hong Kong, I’ve observed several recurring themes, talking points, and strategies by commenters and posters who have taken a stance in favor of mainland China’s authoritarian government (hereafter, the “CPC” for ""Communist Party of China""). Below is a brief summary of these rhetorical observations, along with brief rebuttals.

For background and reference, the protestors in Hong Kong have five demands and objectives. The first, “the complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process,” involves the main precipitating event of the protests, which is a proposed bill that would remove the limited due process that is currently protected in Hong Kong by exposing Hong Citizens to direct political persecution in mainland China. The last, “the resignation of Carrie Lam and the implementation of universal suffrage for Legislative Council and Chief Executive elections,” would ensure a degree of democratic self-governance in Hong Kong while remaining part of China. The remaining three, “the retraction of the ‘riot’ characterization,” “the release and exoneration of arrested protesters,” and “the establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests” are meant to address the ongoing brutal attempt by the government to suppress and discredit the protestors.

For China’s part, democratization in Hong Kong presents an existential threat to their regime. Historically, nothing destabilizes an authoritarian regime more consistently than bordering a democracy. It’s hard for subjects to accept authoritarianism and oppression when free people live on the other side of an imaginary line. China is currently separated from its closest democracies by seas, mountains, and buffer states. The prospect of a free democratic Hong Kong bordering the Chinese mainland has motivated a strong and violent response against the protestors by the Chinese government, even in the face of international condemnation.

Below, I’ve catalogued nine of the recurring themes, talking points, and strategies in pro-CPC propaganda on this sub. Even this post, which ended up being longer than I expected, captures neither the true breadth of the problem nor the depth to which some users have bought into China’s propaganda. A deeper rhetorical analysis would require more space than this post can afford and more time than I have to offer. For starters, I made the decision not to directly quote any specific user spreading propaganda, partially because I don’t want to call out anyone in particular or encourage brigading, although I recognize the lack of direct quotes may weaken my generalizations of those users’ arguments. I also don’t provide supporting evidence for my claims of extensive police brutality—which will likely be noted by those commenters who favor the Chinese government—because the main purpose of this writeup is to discuss the rhetoric on this sub, while I assume by now we’re all too familiar with the plight of the protestors.

&amp;#x200B;

**Using the term “Brainwashing”**

The first and perhaps most clever recurring theme in the pro-CPC posts is the use of the term “brainwashing.” Why would pro-CPC Redditors use this term so consistently? “Brainwashing” is a term that evokes a cartoonish image of people getting hypnotized by pocket watches. The term is meant to immediately denigrate any discussion of China’s extensive and pervasive propaganda campaign. Joking about the term “brainwashing” is also a great way to endear oneself to the audience. But, as we have seen, while the pro-CPC commenters in our sub aren’t brainwashed with swirly eyes, they have bought into much of the Chinese government’s propaganda and are parroting it here.

Pro-CPC commenters using this strategy will say things like, “We’re not brainwashed, we want to hear both sides of the issue” or “I’m just a scary brainwashed foreign student here to answer your questions lol.” Notice that these kinds of phrases make any following discussion of propaganda seem silly while also making the pro-CPC commenters seem reasonable and even funny.

While we’re on the topic of manipulative terminology, it’s worth noting that there are far less clever but equally purposeful attempts to control the narrative through specific terms. The most notable, of course, is to refer to the protests and protestors as “riots” and “rioters.” Other tactics, like using “western values” instead of “human rights” or using “China” and “Chinese people” instead of “the Chinese government” get their own sections below. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Cultivating Apathy**

When people think of the term “propaganda” they often imagine an authoritarian government trying to make their people believe incorrect or even impossible things, like that time that North Korea told its subjects that it found an ancient unicorn lair. The most effective and insidious propaganda isn’t a spread of lies, but a spread of apathy. Getting people to believe your lies is hard, but getting people to stop caring is an easy and effective way to control people. In short, authoritarian governments usually try to get their people to believe that their own beliefs and actions don’t matter, because the outcome will be the same regardless of any action they might take or opinion they might hold.

This strategy has been very noticeable among the pro-CPC posts in this sub. When confronted about their opinions of the Hong Kong protestors’ demands, the response is usually something like, “I don’t care either way, because they’re not going to get their demands met anyway.” Then, having dodged the question about content of protestors’ demands, they can move onto the other recurring themes and talking points of the propaganda.

&amp;#x200B;

**Twisting Hong Kong’s fight for freedom into a persecution of Chinese people**

The protests in Hong Kong are a conflict between the people of Hong Kong and an oppressive authoritarian government. The outcome of the conflict will determine the fate of human rights for millions of people living in Hong Kong and their descendants.

The authoritarian versus freedom fighter nature of the conflict puts the Chinese government in a bad light, obviously. So what is the best way for the government to spin the conflict in its own favor? The answer is to recast the conflict as an imposition of western values on the Chinese people, thus making the discussion one about cultural colonization, racism, and the preservation of Chinese values.

We see this in our subreddit whenever those defending the Chinese government attempt to frame the goals of the Hong Kong protests as “western” or suggest that democracy or human rights in general are somehow incompatible with Chinese values. This ignores that both democracy and a respect for human rights have been successful in a wide variety of cultures throughout the world. This is not only true in Asia in general (see India, the world’s largest democracy) and East Asia specifically (see Japan and South Korea), but even in an actual country populated by Chinese people (see Taiwan, which even if you don’t want to call it a country, is at the very least a functionally independent Chinese island democratically governed by its own people). Democracy has been successful in such a wide variety of countries because the core tenents of democracy—that people should control and be protected from their own government—is not incompatible with any culture, it’s merely incompatible with authoritarian political interests.

Don’t let the rhetoric distract you from the fact that this fight is one between the Chinese people and the Chinese government over their human rights. Siding with the people against their government doesn’t make you a westerner, it just makes you right.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conflating the merits of their opinion with their right to have an opinion**

In the specific case here at UC Davis of pro-CPC students holding their own counter-rallies, we see one of the oldest talking points of those who would use freedom of speech against itself. Several times, we have seen commenters say that they just want to have their own rally and table to share their own views of the Hong Kong protestors. How can you be against the pro-CPC rally if you support the freedoms of speech and assembly?

Those who have lived their lives in oppression might think this is a clever or even profound argument, but those who have lived in the free world are more than familiar with this fallacy by now. It’s the same question every time, always in a new wrapper. “How can you be against Nazi’s marching down your streets yet call yourself a defender of freedom?” or “How can you criticize that person’s remarks? Even if they’re sexist, what about their freedom of speech?”

The answer, of course, is not that we’re against anyone expressing him/her/their-self. If you want to spend your time in a free country to speak out against freedom, then go ahead. But respecting your right to speak doesn’t mean that we have to like your message or respect you for sharing that message. Nor does it mean that we can’t or won’t meet your speech with our own. Freedom to speak is not a mandate to be heard.

&amp;#x200B;

**Refusal to engage with the content of the protestors’ message**

&amp;

**Focusing on the protestors’ symbols rather than the protestors’ message**

I believe that most common strategy of Pro-CPC commenters is their refusal to directly engage the substance of the Hong Kong protestors’ message and demands. Every attempt to solicit a response regarding the five demands of the Hong Kong protestors are ignored or met with quick deflection. This is not surprising, because the demands are far too reasonable to attack directly, leaving deflection as an obvious strategy.

Many of these deflections are to other talking points discussed elsewhere in this post. Here, however, I want to discuss one specific form of deflection—the focus on symbols rather than message. Shifting the discussion to symbols from messages is an incredibly effective strategy when backed into a corner; I’m sure we all employ it from time to time. Symbols are powerful, yet easy to take out of context and easy to assign one’s own meaning. But let’s humor the pro-CPC commenters for a moment and take a look at the actual symbolic arguments they’ve made to distract from the substantive arguments against their government.

For those who don’t know, the UK returned control of Hong Kong to China in 1997, ending over 100 years of foreign rule of the city. Many in Hong Kong feared that the turnover would end many legal protections of their rights that existed under colonial government but which were not protected in China. As these fears have turned out to be very justified, some protestors have turned to the colonial flag of Hong Kong as a message to Chinese and local governments that they and their rights were stronger under foreign occupation than they are now under domestic rule.

Pro-CPC propaganda, however, has seized upon the protestors’ use of the old colonial flag to claim that the protestors are secretly intent on independence or-quite ridiculously-upon return to British colonial rule. This allows the Chinese government to shift the conversation to the preservation of the Chinese state instead of focusing on the actual demands of the protestors, which are quite limited in scope. Don’t let them deflect to symbols; keep the focus on substance.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dehumanization of persecuted groups, namely Uyghurs in China**

When confronted about the extensive state violence against the Uyghur population, keep an eye out for two key responses. First, of course, is deflection and minimization (e.g. “I haven’t heard that much about it, but I don’t think it’s as bad as the media makes it sound"" followed by a subject change). The second is the oldest trick in the book for oppressing minorities: dehumanization. This second point seems to have a lot of buy-in from Chinese commenters, which isn’t surprising because people everywhere have always been eager to buy into any narrative that presents different people as inferior.

In the case of Uyghurs, look for commenters portraying them as especially violent (e.g. “the government had to ban knives where Uyghurs live because they keep trying to stab each other”). This, in turn, builds into a narrative that any state action against the Uyghur population (which, they insist, is minimal) is necessary for the Uyghur’s own good and for the protection of the rest of China. If these themes sound familiar, they should. We’ve seen it many times before, at home and abroad. States don’t persecute minorities for their own good, they do it because the minority group is in the way.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cherry-picking, Exaggerating, Hypocrisy, and False Equivalence**

The hypocrisy and cherry-picking of the pro-CPC commenters deserve their own post, because there is a lot to unpack. In this one section, I want to briefly highlight what to look for.  

All messages, politics, and symbols aside, there are two indisputable truths about the Hong Kong protests. Firstly, the protestors have been extraordinarily peaceful. Even if the very limited but very repeated allegations of violence by the protestors were true, the violent crime rate among the protestors is much lower than a given city of equivalent size. Do the propagandists really not think that a protest of well over a million people wouldn’t have any bad actors? Or are they hoping that we’re that stupid? If anyone tries to convince you that the protestors have been anything other than restrained and peaceful, especially given the circumstances, don’t give them an inch of respect, because they aren’t giving you any.

Secondly, the violence perpetrated by the state against their people in Hong Kong is extraordinarily excessive and atrocious. This is not the actions of a few bad actors within the police force; it is a coordinated and widespread effort by the state to violently quell, intimidate, and suppress their people. Do not let them convince you that both sides are at fault. One side is marching for their freedom, the other is attacking the people.

&amp;#x200B;

**Imposing their own Rules, Ignoring History**

Above, I noted that the propagandists will highlight even the most isolated incident of violence by the protestors as evidence that the protests are generally violent. I also noted that the propagandists try to frame the protests as a secret succession movement. But while it’s abundantly clear that both accusations are patently false, I ask, “why would it matter if the protests were violent riots for independence?”

The propagandists have tried to establish a premise in the debate that all violent protest and all calls for independence would delegitimize the protests at large. But have they forgotten American history or have they also forgotten their own? Weren’t the origins of current US and Chinese states built upon violent uprisings against the incumbent governments? Furthermore, aren’t these revolutions seen as morally justified in their current respective countries? Violence in popular uprisings doesn’t invalidate the uprising or, if it does, then both the United States and China are both built upon illegitimate foundations. In short, the propagandists have been so busy trying to trick us into thinking the Hong Kong protests are violent, they haven’t actually made a case for why they shouldn’t be violent. They are, after all, fighting for their freedom.  So if someone tells you that the Hong Kong protests are too violent, tell them that means China should surrender itself to Taiwan, the last remnant of the government mainland China violently overthrew 70 years ago.

The case of commenters discrediting the protests as a secret independence movement is a somewhat hilarious example of propaganda meant for a Chinese audience finding itself in the wrong forum. This talking point is meant to pander to a common and strong desire in the Chinese population for a unified country, by evoking the specter of succession. This obviously doesn’t land too well in the United States, which was built around the idea that violent succession is justified and necessary in the pursuit freedom, liberty, and democracy. So, as a tip to the pro-CPC commenters, maybe avoid talking points that make the American readers associate the Hong Kong revolutionaries with our founding fathers.

&amp;#x200B;

**Justifying human rights abuses by China’s economic growth**

One final common pro-Chinese government talking point is that the numerous, large, and ongoing human human rights violations throughout China are justified by China’s economic growth over the past few decades. Let’s breeze past how morally repugnant that argument is, because if you think that’s a legitimate justification, no internet rant is going to save you. Instead, let’s take a look at the causal claim that China’s growth is due to its humanitarian atrocities. I argue that with proper perspective, China’s growth has, at best, happened despite its authoritarian government and, at worst, has been greatly delayed by its authoritarianism.

Authoritarianism in general is strongly associated with lower economic growth, although the causal relationship between government type and economic performance is not entirely understood. China is the exception to the poor economic performance of totalitarian government. And even then, controlling for its large population, it’s not an impressive exception with a GDP per capita roughly equivalent to Mexico.

China is the largest country in the world by far, controls resource-rich territory, and has had its current regime for 70 years. The fact that they are now the second largest economy in the world isn’t surprising. The question isn’t why it’s doing well now; the question is why it took so long to catch up. Apologists for the CPC might say that China simply started with next to nothing 70 years ago following the Japanese occupation. Nonetheless, the numbers speak for themselves. Of the other top-ten economies, almost all were devastated by World War Two, yet they managed rebound faster and stronger than China with just a fraction of the population and without committing crimes against humanity. And if we’re talking about growth rate, sure it’s high, but it’s easy to grow a lot when your baseline is so low.  China’s government, policies, and actions have delayed their inevitable economic growth by decades.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR**

Stand up for your fellow humans and their humanity.  We're not fighting in the streets alongside the protestors, but the very least we can do is confront those who would twist the dialog against those fighting for their most basic freedoms."

The whole reason I wasted what little money I have on chocolate and face paint was not for ""attention."" If I wanted attention I'd do something a lot cheaper, like jumping off a building or getting hit by a bus.

The reason I bought those things--with personal money, mind you, not the group's--was to draw more people towards the movement. There are a lot of people who have no idea what's going on, all the American students see is a bunch of strangers yelling in a foreign language.

I figured, hey, *I* like chocolate, so therefore, other people must like chocolate too! So if people like chocolate, they're going to naturally be thrilled by *free* chocolate. I thought it would be a good way to pull people into the protest who would otherwise have no reason to get involved, and hopefully in doing so, teach them about the movement and get them on our side.

As for the face paint, I wanted a way for the protestors and protest supporters to express their beliefs without vandalizing the school. Posters can be torn down, and chalking is against the rules. But there's no rule against face paint, and you can't easily remove it from someone else.

Not only that, but posters can only be in certain stationary locations. You know what can go anywhere, though? All of *us*! We can wander around the school bearing the Hong Kong flower and words of support, and not only will people see it, but they'll have the opportunity to ask the painted person, ""hey, what's all this about?"" So they're not just *seeing* our support. They're interacting with us, and learning about Hong Kong!

I mean, I get where you're coming from. The protests have been bloody and it's not something to make light of. It's a serious subject, and the protestors deserve respect and recognition. Which is exactly why I'm trying to attract people towards the movement.

My hope is that when people see the painted faces tomorrow, they'll want to ask, ""hey, what does that flower symbolize?"" ""Hey, why does it look like your eye was shot out?"" ""Hey, what do those foreign symbols mean?""

I want to make people curious, because curiosity is what drives people to educate themselves."

**The goal of this event** is to provide an open forum and easy opportunity for us, who are feeling a bit lonely, to make some new friends. I understand some are more reserved/introverted than others but judging by the comments in the first thread it's clear to me that this will be a very open and friendly community. It's okay to approach at your own pace, no one will force you; we're happy you're here.  
**Remember:** We're here to make friends, it's wise to avoid hot topics. We all come from different backgrounds and hold different perspectives, they're all valid, let's respect that. Let's be a positive and welcoming environment.

**WHERE/WHEN UPDATE:**   
***When***: 4pm, Sunday, October 20th. After looking through all the comments on the original post I saw that Sunday late-afternoon would be a more fitting time.   
***Where***: E-Street Plaza. Due to so much interest we are moving the meetup spot to the E-Street Plaza. This location is very public/open and will allow us to make plans by ear and find what can accommodate us best. E-Street Plaza is in downtown Davis and has Baskin-Robins, Taqueria El Burrito, and is across from De'Veres Irish Pub. [https://goo.gl/maps/6LCXL1uF4EnScSxi8](https://goo.gl/maps/6LCXL1uF4EnScSxi8)

# Hello Fellow U.C. Davis students!

On **Wednesday, October 30th**, in celebration of Halloween, we will be wearing our **Winnie the Pooh costumes** to protest the ongoing censorship attempts across campus. 

At the same time, **we will be tabling at the Quad** on campus from **11:00 AM until later that afternoon**. We will continue to encourage Senators Harris and Feinstein to support the following bills:

* **H.R.3289 - The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act** of 2019
* **S.1824 - Hong Kong Policy Reevaluation Act** of 2019
* **PROTECT Hong Kong Act** of 2019

You are encouraged to bring any outfits or merchandise with **Winnie the Pooh** on it in support, but any costume is welcomed! 

We encourage both U.C. Davis students and Davis residents to come out and, if not already, sign the letters to our Senators. All support is beneficial to get one step closer towards a Democratic Hong Kong.

# We hope to see you there!

It is possible that the city of Davis and surrounding areas could lose power while UC Davis’ main campus is not affected. City and county notifications are available at the following links:

 In the recent days **Davis4HK** has received harsh treatment for our  involvement in the Free Hong Kong movement on campus. It recently  escalated to the point where **Chinese Students and Scholars Association  (CSSA)** at UC Davis put out a statement saying they had reported us to  the **San Francisco Chinese Consulate (SFCC)**. 

This is another attempt to disseminate fear: 

* What are the consequences of our movement being  reported to the SFCC? 
* Will we, UC Davis students, be personally  targeted now that the SFCC has become involved? 

**These questions are just  the beginning on the implications this could have on our campus.**

 Please help us by signing this letter to help protect our UC Davis  students exercising their right to freedom of speech on campus! We will  not be intimidated!

And honestly, I feel like my four years here at UC Davis and the amount of drama I've experienced here is pretty comparable to that in Twilight. I'm writing this to share my story.

I am currently a 4th year Psychology major. However, because this is Part 1, we will go all the way back to my itty bitty freshman self. 

I am the oldest child with 5 younger siblings. I always felt, and still feel, such a huge responsibility to be a role model for my siblings and to pave a path and encourage them in ways that I never really received because let's face it, I'm the trailblazer here. So, when I was in high school, I did everything possible to get into college: editor of the school's newspaper, ASB Vice President of the student council, second chairman in the baritone section of the school's marching band, Physic's Club President, award-winning MESA member, straight-A student.

I wanted to become a cardiothoracic surgeon. I wanted to study biology. UC Davis has one of the best biology programs in the nation. So honestly, I was pretty fucking stoked when I got my acceptance letter. It was one step towards my dreams coming true.

From my graduating class, there were quite a few of us who were going to attend UCD. Moving away from home and being in a new environment is scary enough, so I decided to room with a high school friend to make things a little bit easier for myself. That was the first big mistake that I made. And maybe it was just the dynamic of our relationship, but because of my experiences, I will forever recommend freshmen to bite the bullet and room with a stranger. Strangers are typically more considerate because they don't know you. They don't have the pre-notion of ""She's my friend, she'll be okay if I do this."" My roommate had a boyfriend from back home. Not saying that roommates with a significant other are a red flag, but definitely make the time to set boundaries. This was another mistake of mine. Because of that, there were many times I walked in on my roommate having sex. I've been sexiled. It's really not the funnest feeling, trust me when I say that.

Because of these issues with my roommate, we grew apart. And subsequently, I kind of grew apart from all of my high school friends who are UCD. At first, it made me really sad. But a hard pill to swallow is that it's okay to grow apart from friends. If anything, it's probably a positive thing for the both of you. Anyway, I tried avoiding my roommate at all costs. I had made a new group of friends (who I still keep close to today). Every morning, I would wake up at 7am to leave the dorm and would not return until 1-2am and go straight to sleep so that I didn't have to interact with my roommate. Consequently, my health suffered. I'm a person who gets frequent headaches and migraines already, but I remember popping Tylenol pills almost every single day. I also gained a lot of weight, about 40-50lbs. To say the least, I felt absolutely miserable.

To top it off, I wasn't the same straight A student I was in high school. I wasn't involved in a whole bunch of extracurricular activities. In fact, at the end of my freshman year, I feel like I lost myself. After winter quarter, I was Subject to Dismissal, and honestly, I was almost okay with it. Maybe college wasn't for me. Maybe I didn't really want to be a cardiothoracic surgeon. Maybe I didn't really like science all that much. I felt like I was having an identity crisis. Maybe I was going to be one of those people who peaked in high school. Maybe I'm not as resilient as I thought I was. I felt so ashamed of my shortcomings and losing relationships that were once really meaningful to me. Yes, of course, I developed new relationships, but one thing you should know about me is I'm a pretty anxious person. Anxiety can do a lot of ugly damage. So yeah, back to my point, they let me stay. And I met my contract, and yeah here I still am. Also, let me just say that Tori Hollowell is the kindest BASC advisor you can get. Let me also say the Microbiology department, in general, have some of the nicest people in the College of BioSci.

At the end of my freshman year, I packed up all of my things from my dorm. Did not even say goodbye to my roommate. I left my checkbook inside one of the drawers, which I called Student Housing Services about, but they never called me back to give me back my checkbook. And that first chapter of my freshman year was done. It was over. And in September 2017, I'll be moving in with three new girls who seemed very promising. I was excited for a new start."

Anyone else not do well their first midterm in chem then turn it around? Any tutor recommendations, other study tips, link to anki decks, anything? Or just someone to tell me that I can turn it around, that I'm not fucked. Thanks!"

What I do during these years of college is exactly like what I did during high school: I would avoid contact with others and keep to myself and then I wonder why I would feel so depressed and lonely. 

Since last year, I still have no friends but I at least am better at small talk. Last year, I would stutter heavily. This year, I've been practicing small talk with my roommates and I've gotten better. I can hold a conversation but it feels rigid because I sometimes listen to what someone else says and think of a reply but, since I lack empathy, I don't express my reply verbally. I sometimes feel like I'm trying to force a reply in order to avoid being silent instead of being genuine. I also have sort of a sense of desperation. Whenever I try to engage in small talk with a girl, I sort of feel like I'm super desperate while other guys are very casual. My voice tends to be more quiet and tremulous. I was told by a therapist that if I've lived like this for many years, there isn't much that I can really improve on. I can make gradual improvements, but for the most part, I'll likely continue in this state. He said that if I put myself ""out there"" more, that I can eventually make some improvement.

My questions are:

1. What do people mean when they say that I should put myself out there? Do I just attend a couple clubs or should I approach random people who are sitting on benches and try talking to them? Would this make me seem creepy? If I saw a guy who I never spoke to directly from a class I took a few years ago talking to like 4 of his friends in the quad, would it be weird if I approached him? 
2. I was wondering if it is realistic to expect myself to be able to transform myself from a person who has a hard time looking people in the eyes and nodding to someone walking down the street at the right time to someone who is able to make small talk with anyone in one year. If I am myself somewhat of a scholarly geek who speaks quietly, is it possible for me to gain the confidence that frat boys talk to girls with? Has anyone had experience with this?"

I know it's a little far in the future to be thinking about what I'm going to do immediately after my lease is up in August 2020, but um yeah the thoughts loom anyway. 

So ultimately my long-term goal is PA (Physician Assistant) program. But of course, if you're familiar with the pre-reqs, I have to gain anywhere between 1000-2000 hours of experience before I can even think about applying for a PA program. I was thinking of gaining this experience by getting my Medical Assistant (MA) certification.  Here is like my general timeline of how I want things to go:

Spring 2020: Apply for a MA program at a CC.

Fall 2020: Hopefully start MA program. I don't think MA programs are full-time, so I'd like to be working as well. I've been thinking about some entry level job as an administrative assistant or something, idk. Any help with this would be amazinnggg.

Spring 2021: Hopefully be done with MA program. Start looking for jobs.

Fall 2021: Hopefully I have an MA job. During this time, I was thinking of taking/retaking some classes at a CC that I need for PA school (Physiology, Anatomy, Stats, etc). 

\*fast forward to Fall 2022..maybe even Spring 2023\* apply for PA programs!!!

Anyway I got really off track, but like my ultimate question is where the heck do you find entry level jobs? Did you move back home after college? Did you get your own place immediately after college? I really wanna get my own place but rent is so expensive. If you're also on the PA route, what's your plan look like?  &gt;.&lt; HELP pls"

I recall last quarter, when I was studying on the fourth floor in one of those secluded desks, doing the same problems over and over again in order to prepare for Mat 21D. I would go there for hours a day, even on the weekends, and just practice the problems. I don't know exactly why but I get depression as soon as I step inside the building and I don't know how to cope with it. It makes me so uncomfortable to go back there because it's so dull and lifeless. I go in the basement occasionally in order to look for a book and it makes me so depressed.

The other day, I studied in that other building which is across from Rock Hall. It's called the Student Community center or something. It felt great. I sat on one of those sofas and just gulped down a coffee so I could study for midterms which I just finished bombing today. I turned my head in a 180 in order to take in the full view. I was just attempting to get used to the atmosphere and people tried to make conversation with me. I don't mention this as if it point it out as a negative. I'm just contrasting the fact that Shield's is so dull and plain and makes me feel depressed but when I go to the SCC (or whatever) it feels so much brighter and warm. I don't even know anyone there but I look around and people react positively to my presence, whereas in the library, they did not even notice me.

I have a question for those who study in such spots: Is it implicitly assumed that those who sit in these spots directly contribute to them financially by buying coffee while using them or is it acceptable for me to sit without drinking coffee? The other day, I drank coffee for the first time in a long time and it felt so good not be in my dark room.

Never talk to them, never give them your information, NEVER invite them into your home. They will up charge your bill and refuse to remove the charge through slimy customer service practices. The BBB has been aware of this company since the beginning of the year, so you can look there for more information. 
They tend to strike later in the day after property managers have gone home. Please tell your neighbors and friends too. I just saw my neighbors talking to the rep and letting them inside. Don’t be like them, never answer the door for solicitors in general, especially at night."

Goes to South West machine to get ticket (also in flat parking lot).



Wednesday:
2. South West machine (machine was working two days ago) had ""Not in Service"" printed on display.

3. North East machine (street level machine at parking structure entrance) took my money, heard printing sounds, no paper comes out (then tried to reach into machine, but no paper was there, not even stuck up inside).

4. North West machine (basement level parking machine at parking structure entrance) said ""Card has already been used this hour"". Had to use different card to get the permit.

This year for Halloween I’ve decided to go as “the college student who has it all together”

I’ll dress to impress in my VSCO Girl outfit, which includes overpriced ‘destructive jeans’ a plaid shirt that doesn’t make me look like a farmer boy out of Wichita, Kansas. The outfit will be complete with a Gucci backpack that implies my credit score is perfect, and my minimum wage job as a barista at a fair trade coffee shop covers all my expenses. Flashing my perfectly bleached smile, I walk into class- knowing that I can still pass this class without having done any of the readings, yet still participate in the class discussions, as if I am THE expert on Kurdish fighters occupying Northern Syria."

Walk in five minutes before the lecture starts, and I see that only three of the four seats she usually saves are occupied, the only unoccupied one being on the edge. So I put in my headphones (I don't play music), walk down to the seat, sit down without saying a word, and immediately turn the other way, and get my notebook and stuff out of my backpack. 

I notice her staring at me, but I pretend like I don't notice. A couple minutes pass and she's switching between whispering to her friends about what to do with me and staring at me. I take out one of my headphones and say, ""Can I help you?""
She responds, ""No, sorry, I thought you were someone else."" And stops staring. Her friend eventually arrives (late) and walks to the second row only to find me in his usual spot. He looks a bit confused and betrayed, then turns around to find a seat somewhere else.

I don't understand how people who came from nothing and ""made it"" don't feel guilty because them making it is causing someone else who's growing up right now to feel like they have nothing. I guess they may have justified it to themselves by saying, well, it's not my responsibility to change the system. Someone else created so someone else should change it. Ok, I get it, but still. You know how it feels to have it hard so then how can you perpetuate the system like that?

Someone please help me understand why this is happening and what I should do when deciding what job to get.

I feel it's already hard enough to find a job that is the right fit, but now also I'm worrying about the ethics of it. On the other hand, I don't wanna shoot myself in the leg and work so hard and then get paid peanuts, because the work is hard after all."

Try not to stay out too late, and if you’re getting home late, let a roommate or friend know. Tell them that if they don’t hear from you in X amount of time to call the cops. Allow each other to each other’s location. 

Don’t carry valuables at night. Leave your wallet in your room. Don’t carry your laptop in your bag if you’re coming home late (which is hard bc were all students) but if they ask you to hand you all your belongings, at least you won’t be a few thousand dollars short. 

Get some pepper spray. It will at least give you a few seconds head-start to run away. VSCO girls carry your huge ass hydro-flask so you can use that to hit someone if you need to. 

Don’t stay in your car after you park. Get the fuck out of your car and hightail it to your apartment. Leave the porch lights on. Ask your neighbors to do so too, that way the street will be more well-lit.

I should have just stayed home, and I regret not making that decision. Although hindsight is 20/20, foresight is not my strong suit.

However. I have been recieving excessive levels of ""criticism"" from two users in particular (plus a few nasty comments from their fan club) who honestly have nothing better to do with their lives than torment a stranger over something that, in the grand scheme of things, is meaningless.

The two of you (everyone knows who I'm talking to here) probably aren't aware of this, but when you got me kicked out of Davis4HK, I was actually planning on killing myself. Thankfully my ex talked me out of it (I'd never seen him cry like that before) but if I hadn't stopped by for a ""last visit"" I wouldn't be here now. You were almost responsible for an innocent person dying. As if UC Davis needs any more of that.

Is it really worth it? Is wasting your time making a stranger miserable really worth the time and effort? You MUST have something better to do than comment something mean on literally everything I say here. Is it fun for you? Do you take pleasure in hurting me? If so, that makes you a literal sadist. And a bully.

If you seriously hate me that much, just block me. I'd rather you do that than continuously bring up a teeny tiny mistake that I made--what, a month ago now? You're making a mountain out of a molehill just to make me look like a bad person, and I don't care what excuses you might have, that's not ok.

You want to call me dumb? Fine. I don't care. It won't matter when I prove you wrong. It won't matter when I'm the one who ultimately saves you from some horrible disease in the end.

But questioning my character crosses a serious line. Even though I might not know what the right thing to do is sometimes, I try my hardest to do what's best for everyone. I try my hardest to make friends with everyone I meet. I try my hardest to make other people's days at least a little bit better. I'm *trying.* Please just cut me some slack."

I just feel frustrated and I want someone to offer insight from the outside. I don't know all the details so that works against me here. My friend was blackout drunk (she had a drinking problem at the time, partially based on the sexual assault she herself suffered a few years prior), at like a house party of a group of UCD students who are part of an organization associated with UCD. The group she was with was also drunk, and some of them possibly blackout drunk. My friend (hereafter ""Friend"") and another girl (let's call her ""2nd girl"") end up in a room together, I know not how. A 3rd girl walks into the room and sees my friend on top of 2nd girl, trying to make out with her or possibly actually making out with her while 2nd girl appeared unconscious. 3rd girl, hereafter ""Accuser,"" accuses my friend of sexual assault to the organization associated with UCD, and ultimately to the appropriate UCD office. Some details: my friend and 2nd girl are comparable in size, 2nd girl being somewhat fitter and taller; my friend has some serious self-esteem problems, history of self-harm, food issues, and hx of severe depression; 2nd girl seems not to have wanted to pursue the case right after it was initiated, but Accuser has a very strong personality and is now spearheading the effort, and getting other members of the group to also contribute to the case (such things as Friend grabbed the crotch of one male of the group while sitting on his lap, Friend inappropriately touched the butt of 2nd Accuser during party, amongst other filings); 2nd girl mysteriously befriended myself and my Friend on facebook maybe a week after the incident. 

I'm not sure what I'm hoping to accomplish by posting this here, I just wish my friend didn't exist in such a vacuum of self-hatred and despair. I wish there was a group on campus not associated with the school that could help her with this. I wish someone non-judicial could intervene. She's like 22, highly intelligent, and she told me she's very suicidal. Don't tell me she should seek professional help or school counseling, I will disregard you, as she would disregard me. She insists on dealing with this herself because she is incredibly stubborn and incredibly hard on herself. Also, she has to spend all her savings on a lawyer for this case. Her family is a little emotionally abusive and has no sympathy for her. She works and lives off-campus. She's afraid she won't graduate and that the sword of Damocles is hanging over her head (my phrasing) so it's difficult for her to do school work, and she normally would be getting straight As (she's STEM). It's just so fucked she feels all persecuted and alone, and I know Accuser is moving forward with the accusations and I think 2nd girl and maybe one other person are going to corroborate, but damn this girl doesn't deserve this."

# At public university in California, only 13 percent of students are white

📷

At the University of California – Merced, demographic statistics at the public university in Northern California show only about 13 percent of its student population is white, the rest are students of color.

According to various online stats, the majority ethnicity at each campus differs. The list below cites the majority ethnicity at each campus:

[**UC Riverside: Hispanic**](https://www.ucr.edu/about/facts.html)  
[**UC Merced: Hispanic**](http://www.ucmerced.edu/fast-facts)  
[**UC Santa Cruz: White**](http://diversity.ucsc.edu/diversity/images/student_demo_2014.pdf)  
[**UC Santa Barbara: White**](http://bap.ucsb.edu/institutional.research/common.data.set.2014.15.pdf)  
[**UCLA: Asian**](https://www.admission.ucla.edu/campusprofile.htm)  
[**UC San Diego: Asian**](http://studentresearch.ucsd.edu/_files/stats-data/enroll/ugethnic.pdf)  
[**UC Davis: Asian**](https://www.ucdavis.edu/sites/default/files/upload/files/uc-davis-student-profile.pdf)  
[**UC Berkeley: Asian**](http://opa.berkeley.edu/uc-berkeley-fall-enrollment-data)  
[**UC Irvine: Asian**](http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-ln-ucsb-latino-20150127-story.html)

UC Merced publicly prides itself on having a diverse student body and claims it “proudly serves the most ethnically and culturally diverse student body among all University of California campuses,” its website [**states**](http://www.ucmerced.edu/diversity).

UC Merced’s student ethnic demographics [**show**](http://www.ucmerced.edu/fast-facts) Hispanics make up the lion’s share of the student body at 3,022 students – or 48.5 percent.

Asians and Pacific Islanders come in second at 1,485 students, or 23.8 percent (Middle Eastern students are included in the Asian category if they are U.S. residents). White students place third at 795 students, or 12.7 percent.

📷Next up? “Nonresident aliens,” defined as students who are not U.S. citizens — either undocumented students or international students. There are 333 such students enrolled, or 5.3 percent of the student population.

After that comes 299 African-American students, which makes up 4.8 percent of the student body. The rest are listed as either “two or more races” or Native American, and 1 percent “declined to state.”

About 99 percent of the student body is from California, with only 24 students [**listed**](http://www.ucmerced.edu/fast-facts) as coming from out of state or a foreign country. That would leave 309 as undocumented students – more than the African American student population.

“UC Merced welcomes students of all ethnicities and backgrounds, and we are proud of the support that we provide to the highly qualified, UC-eligible first-generation students from our region and elsewhere who often aren’t exposed to higher education opportunities early on,” campus spokesperson James Leonard said in an email to *The College Fix*.

He added “undocumented students represent all ethnicities and nationalities. We often don’t know how they identify, which makes it difficult to compare that category to others.”

[**RELATED: Tired of Racism Claims, UCLA Student Sets Record Straight**](http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/16312/)

UC Merced also has a “Hispanic-serving institution” designation, handed down by the U.S. Department of Education in 2010. That makes the university eligible for a host of funding and grants from the U.S. departments of Education, Agriculture, and Housing and Urban Development. Interestingly, UC Merced does not offer a major in ethnic studies or Chicano/Latino studies.

[**RELATED: Hispanic High School Grads Outpace White Peers in College Enrollment Rates**](http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/13488/)

In some ways, the student population at UC Merced mirrors California’s demographic trends. Gov. Jerry Brown’s office [**reported**](http://www.ebudget.ca.gov/2014-15/pdf/BudgetSummary/FullBudgetSummary.pdf) in 2014 that statewide Hispanic residents surpassed whites, coming in at 39 percent compared to 38.8 percent, respectively. Asian residents come in at 13 percent, followed by Black residents at 5.8 percent. Multi-race was 2.6 percent, then came Pacific Islander and American Indian at 1 percent apiece.

“As the Hispanic population in California continues to grow, the proportions of the other race groups will decline slightly, except for Asian, which through immigration should sustain its proportion of the population over the next five years,” the governor’s office stated.

When asked whether or not certain ethnic groups at UC Merced appear to be underrepresented, Leonard says “it really depends on the context” and that “our distribution of ethnicities is much more similar to that of the San Joaquin Valley than of California as a whole.”

According to the most recent stats available online, white students are not the most represented demographic at at least six other UC campuses as well, but none of the campuses have such a small percentage of Caucasian students as UC Merced except for UC Riverside, which has a white student population of 15.6 percent, according to its [**website**](https://www.ucr.edu/about/facts.html).

For instance, someone could be US, Britain, Soviet Union, Italy, France, Japan, Germany, and so on...

Here are some other unique gamemodes I've thought of:

* We just have Soviet Union v. Germany
* or U.S. vs. Japan
* Here's a really interesting one: Weimer Germany. Someone is Hitler, someone is the communists, someone is the right wing military guys (idk i have to refresh on this time period) and we are all vying for power

I'm also open to trying different time periods such as that of european history or american revolution however I don't have much knowledge on European history. I'm American to the core.

Some people might suggest that I join Model United Nations however I was already in this club in high school and I find that when you have a large amount of people (like 15) it gets chaotic and some people get egregious. For example, I was once George III ruling over the 13 colonies and the colonies just sought independence immediately without even compromising so I tried to burn it all to the ground and so on.

I used to want to see Chinese people succeed, to see China succeed. I wanted the world to know that Asians aren’t just a footnote as they were in my history books growing up, but that we have and can continue to contribute great things too. I cheered for China in the Olympics (and the US). I started supporting companies like Huawei and Xiaomi when they began releasing quality products. 

But slowly that all changed. I started hearing the kinds of things mainlanders were saying. My girlfriend’s family from China, China-based news sites, and my mainlander friends on WeChat.

Now whenever I see Chinese international students on campus, especially if they are wearing $1000+ streetwear outfits I assume they are hypocritical, spoiled, selfish, Chinese nationalists. I loathe them.

I know not all international students are like this. Most of the Chinese international students I have gotten to know are nice on a personal level. But I can’t help but think it’s only because I don’t dare bring up anything related to China, the US, and especially Hong Kong. 

Whenever I do hear mainlanders talk about the US and China it’s always about how much better China is. It’s true that the US is falling behind. It takes forever to get anything done compared with China. Building a bridge in the US? Takes 5 years. Building a bridge twice as long in China? Takes 6 months. But that’s not the point. There are pros and cons to every country, but if all you can do is shit on the US and praise China to no tomorrow then why are you even here? Why don’t you go back to that perfect country? And no, I don’t mean that in a Conservative way. In fact, I believe that one of the only ways the US can remain a world power is by encouraging more talent to come here from other countries and by doing our best to welcome them to stay here. But I’m just saying that it is hypocritical to keep shitting on the US and how great your home country is when you came here for a reason...

And don’t get me started on Hong Kong. Hearing those smug mainlanders trivializing the movement or cheering when a Hong Kong protestor get shot makes my blood boil. And since the only time I hear mainlanders talk about the situation it is with this smug, callous, and self-righteous attitude I can’t help but project this on every Chinese international student I see.

It doesn’t help that my girlfriend’s family is pro-China so it further reinforces my poor opinion of Chinese from the mainland when I constantly hear her family spewing anti-HK and anti-American sentiment (all while living in the US ffs!).

**But the reason I am posting this is not to spew hatred. It is because I feel bad for judging people I don’t know.** All my life I’ve hated stereotypes but now I am the one doing the stereotyping.

I don’t know what will help me change my perspective but I’m hoping people can help. It’s just so hard when I keep hearing such hateful comments. Such lack of empathy. It makes me sick."

However there's also a lot more demand for UWP courses and I've noticed that most sections are already almost full, which makes me think that either way I'm going to end up a class short. 

What's my best play here? Cross my fingers and take my chances on the waitlist when the unit limit ends?

I want to go to Vet School but a peer advisor I spoke to told me if I feel I'm not strong in science then I should reconsider going to vet school because all they look at are science grades. I have always planned towards only being a Veterinarian. I'm not stupid. I just feel it right now. Should I reconsider studying Animal Science? Maybe go into some other major? I considered doing business, marketing, and or communications. I'm a people person, I'm a fixer, and I do well with humanities courses.

I had to take a Clifton Strengths test for a research seminar I am taking, recommended jobs are Medicine, Counseling, Sales, Bussiness, Marketing, Human Resources, Teaching, and Advertising.

I want to go to grad school, get a master’s and try to go into R&amp;D for industry.

This may seem contradictory, but I’m not too interested in hands-on stuff, but am attracted to the design aspect of engineering (which is why I’m leaning towards research in engineering) or the theoretical concepts that applied physics might better provide.

Any insight is appreciated!"

After hours on the phone, several dozen faxes, and repeated crying this summer, I finally got them to tell me what my actual award was and get my loans processed properly. During that time I was assured by two different people that I would be covered based on the loans I took out for this year and next and that nothing would change. I saw my bill and owe like $600 for winter quarter. Idk if this is a mistake or if they’ve royally fucked up and lied to me again. These constant “mix ups” on their part are completely fucked up. There is no room to provide false information and place certainty on half sure answers with stuff like this. Has anyone else experienced similar issues??? I was told that they have STUDENTS working in the office answering these questions not professionals and if that is true that’s fucking ridiculous."

e125pw,UC Davis TAG/General admission question,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/e125pw/uc_davis_taggeneral_admission_question/,Xtrelevant,1,2019-11-24 10:16:57,16,/r/UCDavis/comments/e125pw/uc_davis_taggeneral_admission_question/,NaN," So this entire thing has been stressing me tf out lately:

I'm currently a sophomore at De Anza College and am applying to transfer to a UC for the Fall 2020 term. I applied for TAG for UC Davis, and despite my belief that I had met all the requirements for UC Davis for my major (Computer Science), my TAG was not approved, with the stated reason on my UC transfer admission planner portal:

*""Your GPA in a selective major preparatory course or course group falls below the minimum required for your major at the time of TAG submission.""*

The computer science selective course requirements for math for Davis are Math21A, Math21B, and Math21C. I cleared both Math21A and Math21B with my Calculus BC AP Score of 5, so I did not have a GPA for those two courses. So the only course in this series that I was able to take at De Anza was Math21C, which I got a B in. But since Berkeley and UCLA require taking the entire math series, I have also taken additional higher level, more rigorous math courses in which, including Math21C, I received an overall GPA of 3.5 in the MATH-specific selective courses. Here's basically a summary of what classes I took in each series and the grades I received.

\- Math1C (Calculus): B (3.0)- Math 1D (Multivariable Calculus): A (4.0)- Math 2A (Differential Equations): A (4.0)- Math 2B (Linear Algebra): B (4.0)- Math 22 (Discrete Math): In Progress**Overall Math series GPA: 3.5 at time of admission, higher than required GPA of 3.4**

In addition, here is a summary of the Computer Science specific selective major courses I've taken at De Anza:

\-CIS22A (Intro C++): A (4.0)-CIS22B (Intermediate C++): A (4.0)-CIS29 (Advanced C++): A+ (4.0)-CIS22C (Data Structures): B+ (3.3)-CIS40 (Intro Python): A+ (4.0)-CIS41A (Intermediate python): In Progress**Overall Computer Science series GPA: 3.86 at time of admission, higher than required GPA of 3.5**

**My overall UC-Transferable course GPA at time of admission is 3.72, also higher than required GPA of 3.4**

With that being said, since I was not approved for TAG for this special circumstance of having previously cleared both Math21A and Math21B with my AP Score and not allowing them to be counted towards my GPA does that mean that I'm also not eligible for transfer for general admission either, despite having went above and beyond their requirements for math? 

&amp;#x200B;

So basically my question is, **if I wasn't eligible for TAG, will I still be eligible for general admission?** Or am I royally screwed and need to wait another full year at deanza to try and take those two courses for a grade before I can even try to transfer again? (Would be a waste of an entire year of my life)."

The head TA claimed in the email some students (my peers and I) did not get 5 minutes and something about the mean in all the test rooms were the same, so nothing will be done about to give my peers or I extra points.
Of course, he is lying a little. Our test room ran out of tests twice, and the test was supposed to start at 730, but we ended up starting at 755, which he gave us until 900, but everyone had to make it to their next classes, so people starting leaving at 850. The test was supposed to be 80 minutes, but in actuality we had around 55-60 minutes. I think it’s unfair, but what should I do about it. I felt like if I had extra time I could have gone back and thought out my answers and checked answers, but I felt rushed, so my performance was bad. I don’t know if telling the professor is worth it. Or if he even cares? Is he going to take the TAs words or believe what we have to say? Any suggestions?
Some people I know have already emailed the professor to make appointments with him to address the issue. But, what he will he even do about this?

I obviously care about my grade, but I don’t want to pester the professor."

Let's say the average grade on a midterm is 55/103, and I got 50/103.
If the teacher curves to make the average a B-, about what grade (in %) can I expect?

I feel so dumb struggling like this because I feel like by now I should be used to this. I’m going on my 4th year of college and I still have no clue as to what I want to do with my life. Fall quarter was extremely rough me having to do deal with being far away from home, the loneliness, struggling class despite putting my hardest efforts, issues with tuition and just overall my poor mental health. 

In cc I was struggling as well because I was in a major that I was unhappy in. But I had Davis as my largest motivation. Prior then, I visited the campus multiple times, met with many advisors and I overall felt safe and excited to one day be coming here. I wanted to attend Davis because I wanted to do well academically and just be in a space where I was happy in. In addition to transferring into a major I was working hard towards. 

Now that I’m here, I’m just reminded of how much of big loser I still am. I’m struggling so much in my classes, I’m having trouble making friends, my plans for covering tuition is falling apart to the point where I have no clue on how I’m gonna pay for next quarter’s tuition, and I’m approaching my last few years of college with no clue as to what I want to do with my life. I’m so scared for my future y’all, all I want to do is call it quits and just go home. I’m starting to think I made mistake coming here despite my initial pure excitement and joy of being accepted here. 

But I’m too terrified of doing that as well. Any advice is much appreciated. I’m just tired of crying every night in my apartment."

It didn't go anywhere so I didn't try to go further but now, it's been three quarters since I took that class and I'm still missing all the good memories studying hard and the girl eye fucking me. I even found her on tinder dressed with a shirt and undergarments. I just swiped right instead of superliking because I did not want to seem weird. I still think of her even now as I'm depressed sitting in my room trying to study for these classes. I took only three classes, as my advisor advised and I ended up doing good in one of them and I'm struggling for a C in the other two. I have to get a 66% and 73% in each of them to pass, which isn't so bad, but I'm still stressed and thinking about that missed opportunity. It's not like I can go back and take the next chem anyway because it would just put me behind and I would only be taking a class because of this memory I had of this cute girl.

All of my discussion TA's for general classes (chem, bis, ect) are international male students who can't explain things very well, and it gets frustrating very quickly (To no fault of their own, I know they are trying). I  hate the learning mindset this school has, which often doesn't leave room for mistakes and as soon as you get behind there's no returning to your original pace.

I'm depressed and The SHWC doesn't even have enough therapists to see all of us, they're booked out -2 weeks. The online resource crisis line is literally scripted and didn't help at all ""did I help you move from a 'hot moment' to a 'cool calm' today?"" (Yes, that's a quote. The whole conversation went like this). All I needed was human connection and guidance earlier than the two week waiting period they offered.

Davis is accepting more students than it can handle and it's causing issues across the board, from mental health, class impactions, and housing space. 

I don't know how you upper-grads handle this but ive just been smoking weed to manage my anxiety and depression and it's obviously not helping. (no need to lecture there, it's a short term gratifying solution, I know) I don't know what to do, I feel alone, uncared for, uncomfortable, and destined to fail. 
I regret choosing Davis and wish I had gone to CC. I think I just can't handle the pace of this school, and maybe it's just a me problem. I feel it's too late to back out or even transfer to another UC now, I'm in my second year and don't know what my options are until after break because it was the soonest appointment I could get with an academic counselor. 
How do you guys manage it? It's too easy for me to fall into this pit of procrastination and depression, and it's a ruthless cycle."

Woke up this morning and felt sick to my stomach, so I elected not to go to class, and ended up falling back asleep. Woke up again and realized I had missed the submission deadline for a research paper by about 20 minutes, and the assignment on canvas was closed.

Immediately I sent an e-mail to my professor and TA with a copy of my paper, apologizing and asking them to please consider my paper in spite of the professor's ""no late papers policy"" due to how little I had missed the deadline by. Waiting to hear back from them now.

This is a pretty big bummer, because I did well on the midterm and thought I did a good job on the paper, so I was hoping to get an A, but now it's possible I won't even pass... I'm a senior and applying to law school to boot, so failing could hurt me pretty badly.

I was just wondering if anyone here had any advice on how to proceed? I know that I messed up badly, but it feels like a huge punishment for an honest mistake. I'm already feeling pretty crappy at the moment, so it kind of feels like the world is ending lol, I guess I just need to know that it's not, and if anyone has any recommendations on how to improve my position, that would be a nice bonus :)"

Hello,

I am writing to educators, academics, and academic institutions to encourage the adoption of a course of study related to the issue of “ufos” (the most commonly used term though the United Stated government and many others today prefer the term “unidentified aerial phenomenon” or “uap”).

Despite the “breaking news” on this subject since the NY Times report of December 2017 (when they identified a Pentagon UFO study program and released Navy pilot film), signs of a continued avoidance to addressing this subject remain.

Nevertheless, there are beginning signs of a growing recognition of the need to address this, no matter where this leads. In September 2019, Politico’s Bryan Bender noted an interesting statement by the Ranking Member of the House Homeland Security Committee, Matk Walker (R-NC). Walker had been making inquiries in a partially frustrated attempt to determine whether the Chinese or Russians have made an extraordinary and dramatic leap in technology. It appears he may be realizing something else may be happening:

“In a recent interview, Walker, a former pastor, also acknowledged that he is open to the possibility that there are no easy explanations—or the answers could change how humanity perceives the known universe.”

Since preparing a course of study for a long-ignored subject may be a difficult and confusing process at the start, I want to identify a resource that can serve as a good starting point for that:

THE UFO ENCYCLOPEDIA, 3rd Edition, Two Volumes, edited by Jerome Clark. (Make sure you get the 2018 released 3rd edition; published by OMNIGRAPHICS.)

There are very limited UFO courses in a very small number of academic institutions; these may serve as helpful models.

There are also a few expensive online UFO courses of study.

Since I have had 50 plus years of intermittently engaging in a concentrated study of the subject, I began in late May 2019 to write educational content for different aspects of this subject:

Have you used the Crisis Text Line before? If so, was it helpful?

At UC Davis, we primarily promote the Crisis Text Line as the most common resource for students who may be in a mental health or emotional crisis. However, it has come to my attention that some students have had mixed experiences with the service, which has made me wonder if UCD should focus on promoting other resources instead. 

Please take 1-2 minutes to complete this survey and let us know about your honest thoughts on the Crisis Text Line:  [https://forms.gle/4nVonm9STyumQGgr5](https://forms.gle/4nVonm9STyumQGgr5).

This feedback will really help in understanding which resources students actually find helpful, so every response counts.

I'm a first-year transfer student and BIS2B murdered me this quarter mostly due to short exam times. As a result, I had a lot of performance anxiety during exams and realized I did so much better on the final when we were alotted 2 whole hours instead of a measly 50 minutes. 

Does anyone know how the process works to apply for an SDC Accommodation? Do we need the forms signed by a counselor or psychiatrist, or can we just get them signed from our primary care physician? I emailed them and they replied back but were still super vague

Thank you!"

Are there any Community and Regional Development majors that can tell me how their experience has been/is going at UC Davis, and maybe what I should expect in terms of class workload or job connections for people enrolled in the major?   


One more thing: My SAT scores and GPA are on par with the student body as a whole, but will I have an especially hard time getting into Community and Regional Development? I'm having trouble figuring out how popular this major is on-campus.

I got a D. So I can move on to the next class but...

One of the extra credit assignments was a paper that was graded shortly after the final. I emailed back and forth with my TA once the grades were released, because my score on it was way lower than I expected. I worked hard on it and included all of the information.

Next thing I know, I get a D+ in a class I felt pretty good about, because I apparently got a 37 on a final I felt pretty good about. I haven’t seen the test, and I didn’t even get my grade back on canvas; my TA emailed it to me when I asked him why they hadn’t released grades yet submitted to Oasis.

Now, I’m really confused. I don’t think I actually flunked the final like that, but I have no way to prove it, and really don’t want to get a D in a class I was actually doing well in. I just don’t know what to do. Do you think it’s worth emailing my professor about my grade, or will I just get a condescending response back about how awful I did on the final?"

I love chem but I’m just not very good at it. I didn’t take any AP stem classes in high school and I seem to understand the material on the CHE2A midterms/OWL, but the final messed me up. I got a C+ even though I feel like I worked pretty hard and efficiently.

ed3s6n,Do most students understand how curves work?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/ed3s6n/do_most_students_understand_how_curves_work/,IoSonoFormaggio,1,2019-12-19 18:38:43,10,/r/UCDavis/comments/ed3s6n/do_most_students_understand_how_curves_work/,NaN,"I am a Junior and I've been thinking about this for a while.

For the past 2 and a half years, after every single exam (especially after the final grades are out) people seem to constantly flood piazza (or any other choice of communication) with questions regarding curves. A lot of them just didn't make sense to me. I wanted to discuss about this for a while.

So basically what I noticed is that professors usually aim for a 70~75% average on an exam, and set that as a C or C+. If the average is close enough, or if the average is higher than the target, the class usually isn't curved (unless the average is too high, in which case a downcurve can be applied in very rare cases)

If the average is lower than the target, professors curve the class to have a C or C+ average. For example, getting a 66% on an exam where the average was 50%, you will likely get curved to a B or B+. 

Students also seem to ask for curves even when the class average is well over 80% with plenty of chances given by the professor for extra credit and whatnot. Most of the time if someone asks a question about a curve, it gets serenaded with a thread of replies asking about the same thing. 

Am I missing something or people just misinformed?"

In terms of programming languages that I know, R would be my strongest one since I have to use it throughout my Statistics courses, Python would be in 2nd place since I have used it in the ECS 32 series and I did look into some of the statistical libraries that Python has, and MATLAB and SQL are tied for being my weakest languages since I only recently self-learned them, so my experience is no where near as strong in these 2.

Hello,
I am writing to educators, academics, and academic institutions to encourage the adoption of a course of study related to the issue of “ufos” (the most commonly used term though the United Stated government and many others today prefer the term “unidentified aerial phenomenon” or “uap”).
Despite the “breaking news” on this subject since the NY Times report of December 2017 (when they identified a Pentagon UFO study program and released Navy pilot film), signs of a continued avoidance to addressing this subject remain.
Nevertheless, there are beginning signs of a growing recognition of the need to address this, no matter where this leads. In September 2019, Politico’s Bryan Bender noted an interesting statement by the Ranking Member of the House Homeland Security Committee, Matk Walker (R-NC). Walker had been making inquiries in a partially frustrated attempt to determine whether the Chinese or Russians have made an extraordinary and dramatic leap in technology. It appears he may be realizing something else may be happening:
“In a recent interview, Walker, a former pastor, also acknowledged that he is open to the possibility that there are no easy explanations—or the answers could change how humanity perceives the known universe.”
Since preparing a course of study for a long-ignored subject may be a difficult and confusing process at the start, I want to identify a resource that can serve as a good starting point for that:
THE UFO ENCYCLOPEDIA, 3rd Edition, Two Volumes, edited by Jerome Clark. (Make sure you get the 2018 released 3rd edition; published by OMNIGRAPHICS.)
There are very limited UFO courses in a very small number of academic institutions; these may serve as helpful models.
There are also a few expensive online UFO courses of study.
Since I have had 50 plus years of intermittently engaging in a concentrated study of the subject, I began in late May 2019 to write educational content for different aspects of this subject:
http://cosmic-pluralism-studies.academy
As stated there, the material can be freely adopted, or utilized in any way, without attribution.
Finally, it would be great to see academic institutions as a safe refuge for encounter experiencers to relate their experiences in a setting that adheres to strict standards in research, something often lacking in the uncredentialed arena of ufology.
Thankyou for considering this.

I am myself in my second year and I imagine that I could have got by with ease while working my first year but now I'm in my second year and I have heard that things are supposed to get much more difficult. I'm taking just 15 units this quarter and it looks like I'll be taking 16 units next quarter. I am a little bit ahead because of previous credit (4 classes I imagine).

On one hand, working would be a disadvantage because my work hours may conflict with office hours/study session hours. I may also find it more difficult to keep on top of things. Since my only hobby is working out, I imagine that I would have to cut down on this. If I worked say 10 or 15 hours a week, I would have to accept that my gpa would probably decrease. I have never had a desire to get a high GPA. I'm fine with a gpa between 3.0 and 3.5.

On the other hand, working would be an advantage because I'm very introverted and the only friends I have are a couple of people on snapchat who I haven't spoken to in over a year. Working would force me to talk to people and I would gain a skill which would help me in the workplace or if I want to be an entrepreneur. Also, I don't mean to be a dog in heat however there are a large number of  attractive people in this college and my ability to flirt is limited so I'm trying to learn how to increase my fluidity although I am somewhat pessimistic in this area. My only previous experience was with a girl on tinder with whom I attempted to go far but was cut short after she had kissed me without my consent while watching netflix and I nervously panted. The likelihood of me experiencing such an opportunity like is low through tinder however I imagine a job may increase the likelihood."

It reduced my future payments just to tack them onto month one, which I already paid off 12/15. Now it's charging me a late 10$ fee for having a sudden x amount due added to it and idk how long I have before it might randomly drop me from my classes.

I've already read up a bit on the program, and the main reason I'm considering it is the priority registration, which I've been told will be especially useful for my major.

However, it also says I have to take 6 (?) honors courses before my junior year. Does that mean I'll have to take 2 per quarter next year? That might just apply to people who got in right off the bat, but I want to make sure.

How rigorous are the honors classes compared to a normal class? I know they are smaller classes, but how does the difficulty compare?

What sort of classes are typically offered under the honors program? Are there any that will always have an honors course?

What will the program be like starting my junior year and afterwards? Is there anything else I am missing?

Assuming I get A/B on them - when they calculate the GPA, do they calculate it as 12/12 + 9/12, or 20/20 + 15/20? 

Do they have a database that converts CC to Davis courses using [assist.org](https://assist.org), and automates this process? Or do they not even use/look at [assist.org](https://assist.org), and only uses CC courses and the course titles?

It emphasizes relaxation, sensitivity, structure, and speed rather than force and strength. Wing Chun uses arm strikes, leg strikes, trapping and control techniques as part of its fighting arsenal. Legend has it that the style was created by a Shaolin nun named Ng Mui and was first taught to a young woman named Yim Wing Chun in order for her to defend herself against a local warlord. The art continued to be passed down hundreds of years later to famous masters such as Ip Man and Bruce Lee. Simple and easy to learn, practitioners become effective extremely quickly through Wing Chun’s unique and innovative teaching system.

The microwave is fine and the freezer is fine. It’s just the fridge that’s not working properly which I really need to. I had just bought milk from Trader Joe’s (not longer than 3 days ago) and last night I went to drink it from my fridge and it had curdled. The expiration date was by the end of next week so it wasn’t bad by any means. I just bought this milk though and I had to throw away like half a gallon of milk. This had happened once before winter break where the milk curdled but it was close to expiration date so I assumed it was fine. In fact the milk has always been fine when I used the fridge last quarter except for the issue where it would spoil a little before the expiration date but it would always be at least near it. In my case now I like just bought the milk a few days ago and it’s already bad. It’s ridiculous and infuriating. I already sent a service request on the fridge rental site for ASUCD but idk how long they’ll take to respond. If any of you can help i would be so grateful.

I am in need of a model for this Friday January 17, and also for future classes. 

We are looking for root touch ups, all over color. We are also looking for highlights and balayages as long as they aren't too intense. The reason for this is because, unfortunately, our color instructor is leaving in March, so it wouldn't be wise to start a big project that we can't guarantee we could finish before she leaves.

The classes start at 11 am and I always suggest to bring a snack because they can go until well into the afternoon if it's a larger project. The cost is between $25-$30, which is purely for the products we have to purchase to color the hair. 

If you are interested, or have any questions, please feel free to text me at 707-812-3309.
Our salon website is refinerysalon.squarespace.com and my professional Instagram is @the.beauty.biz in case you wanted to see some projects I've worked on in the past. Hope to hear from you soon!"

It's frustrating beyond belief. I'm tired of deciphering floating text boxes, crazy fonts, nonsensical outlines, and material with absolutely no structure/organization. What's the point of posting the slides when they're so crowded and convoluted? I've seen professors copy and paste entire articles from Wikipedia on a single slide, in pt. 8 Times New Roman. Sometimes they truncate so many of their phrases that the content no longer makes sense outside of the classroom. I understand that attending lecture is half the solution to this, but sometimes I simply want to review material, or study, or even make up classes I missed due to chronic illness. And this isn't even taking into account how many of the professors here can't teach, technology aside.

I'm just venting. I pay way too much money for this to happen so often. I expect my teachers to be able to teach. Of course there are many great professors here, and I am grateful for all they do, and I understand not every professor is perfect, but I'm exhausted."

The proposed tuition increase, which UC regents will consider next Wednesday, would be the second in nine years and the amount would vary depending on two plans presented.

One plan — to raise tuition and fees for all students annually by the cost of inflation — would amount to a projected 2.8% increase of $348 over last year, to $12,918 for fall 2020.

The second plan would raise tuition and fees once for each incoming class, called cohorts, but keep those costs flat for six years. Under that plan, the costs for the entering class of 2020-21 would increase over last year by 4.8%, or $606, to $13,176 for California undergraduates.

It sucks. It really does. You can't go anywhere without people reminding you of your past mistakes, even years later.

So if you see me shitposting on this subreddit, here's the explanation. And I'll only be saying it once.

Nothing matters anymore. When you're on the wrong side of cancel culture, no matter what you do, people will hate you for it. 

Save a puppy from getting hit by a car? ""You caused a car to crash, and people are more important than animals, asshole!""

Pass out expensive chocolate for absolutely free in an attempt to raise awareness about Hong Kong's (soon to be lost) autonomy? ""It doesn't matter WHAT precautions you took to keep people from getting sick, you shouldn't have showed up at all!""

Try to point out where someone's keys are so that they know where to find them? ""Someone could steal them, you idiot!"" (As if anyone other than the owner would know what the keys go to.) 

Try to learn about a complex topic that you care about so that you can help people in the long run? ""You shouldn't even be at this institution!""

Feed a starving homeless man? ""You should have fed him something vegan, you spineless animal killer!""

Literally cure cancer? ""You've opened the floodgates to designer babies, you monster!""

Save a kid from a burning building? ""He's the kid who set it on fire! You should have let him burn!""

Discover time travel? ""How DARE you fuck with timespace like that! We're all going to die now!""

Build a homeless shelter? ""It doesn't even have AC! They'll all die of heat stroke!""

Etcetera etcetera, you get the idea. The world isn't fair. Especially now. Our economy is busted, and we're at each other's throats. Whoever cancels the next person to make a mistake gets mountains of clout, and the person who's cancelled? Well, they just have to fucking deal with it, because the world has abandoned them.

Most of the people on this subreddit are probably facing the same issues I am--can't afford housing, relies on parents for groceries, suffering from major depression and anxiety and having to spend what little money you have on medication so you don't commit suicide, overworked from school, trying to balance school and work, trying to keep the few friends you have left.

Despite that--despite the fact that I'm a person, just like the rest of you--you're probably going to downvote this and leave a mean comment, just because I'm the person to speak up about this.

What I'm expecting is something that has to do with either illness or illness+baking, because those are literally the only jokes you have. I've heard it all, I've gone numb to it.

Which is crazy, right? Isn't a punishment supposed to hurt? Well, that's the thing about punishing someone after they've already learned their lesson. It's pointless.

People are rabid nowadays. You don't have to like a person, but is showing them common decency really a crime? What if your best friend sat next to someone in a MAGA hat on the bus and didn't say anything rude to them? Would you stop being their friend? Even accuse them of being secretly right-wing? 

What if your own mother accidentally posted an offensive meme because she didn't understand why it was offensive? Would you disown her? Or would you calmly explain to her what was wrong with it so that she understands?

What if your favorite presidential candidate happened to cheat on their partner when they were in high school? Would you stop supporting them, or forgive them because everyone's dumb when they're young?

A lot of people pick the meaner answers to these. Why? Likely because our generation has one of the biggest problems to plague mankind--the feeling that you're only good enough when you're better than someone else.

But what if you're not particularly good at anything, or don't have much self confidence? Well, there's always morality! It's easy to be nice, right? So when someone does something that could cause harm, you think to yourself, ""wow! I'm better at being nice than they are!"" 

Which should leave you with the warm fuzzy addicting feeling of moral superiority, right? Wrong. It's not enough. That feeling that you crave only comes once you've made the other person aware that they fucked up.

It feels good, doesn't it? Too good. So good, in fact, that you need more of it. So you keep reminding them that they fucked up--not because you actually care whether they learn not to do it again or not, but because you want to remind yourself that you're better than them.

It gets boring after a while. They stop feeling pain, and soon the satisfaction fades. So you need a new toy. Hmm, who to go after next, you ponder. And then somebody else uses the wrong vocabulary term (how dare they say that!) and you now have fresh meat.

How do I know all this? Because years and years ago, I was just like any of you. If someone did something wrong, I was the first to tell them. I would hold grudges for *years.* 

But I've learned. Being on the sharp end of the spear has taught me what it's like for the people you harass. So you know what I do now?

I don't punish. I educate. I tell them why what they did was wrong, then once they learn their lesson, I forgive them and move on. Like any of us *should* be doing. But most of us don't. And it's sad. 

It's sad to see so many of us, so similar in so many ways, with many of the same struggles, the same experiences, attacking each other for our flaws instead of building each other up for our good qualities.

You know what would make my day? If I got a compliment for how good I am at baking. If someone liked something I drew, or even just thought my T-shirt was funny.

I go out of my way to be nice to strangers I meet around campus. I'll see something unique about a person, and compliment them for it. I hold doors open for people. I'll keep the elevator door open for someone who's rushing to make it in. I give what little cash I have to people who need it more than me. If I see someone crying I will drop everything just to comfort them. I thank my God damned mailman, for pete's sake.

And I see a lot of people do the same thing. People hold doors for me all the time, too. If someone loses something, people will go out of their way to return the lost item. I lost my phone once, and got it back the same day because somebody was nice enough to turn it in to the police.

I know there are nice people out there. It's just that the mean people are so much louder.

One person on this subreddit even got banned, and made an alt for the sole purpose of continuing to harass me.

Nobody. *Nobody* deserves to be beaten into the pavement for a small (or even medium!) mistake. In my opinion, the only people who deserve that kind of treatment are literal rapists and murderers, which I hope none of you have had the misfortune of encountering.

So, the next time you want to feel morally superior, think to yourself--is harassing this person for their past mistakes really moral at all?

To those of you who've read this whole thing, thank you for your time and patience. It is much appreciated.

Tl;dr If you want to be a good person, don't repeatedly harass someone for their mistakes. Once they've learned not to do it again, leave them the hell alone. You don't have to like them, but you certainly shouldn't be going out of your way to ruin their life."

If you have any information, reviews, or would like to expand on some details of properties listed in this post, comment or pm me. I will try to update this post within reason.

#On Campus    
These locations will have easy access to campus. Transportation can include walking, biking, bus. Typically will be expensive options with more rules than off-campus options. Usually, residence is limited to 9 months.    

##Dorms:    
Single $5,772-$6,304/qtr, Double  $5227-$5759/qtr, Triple $4727-$5259/qtr    
Only guaranteed space for freshmen. Expensive option that comes with meal plan (required). I would not recommend this option if you are trying to save money.    
https://housing.ucdavis.edu/fees/residence-halls-and-sha/ 

##Student Housing Apartments (SHA)    
Double $3787-$5816/qtr, Single $4414-$6442/qtr, Studio $6197-$8226/qtr    
Only second-year+ students allowed to apply (with the exception of freshmen who need it for winter break). Limited availability. Meal plan optional.    
https://housing.ucdavis.edu/fees/residence-halls-and-sha/ 

##Solano Park Apartments    
1 bed $766/month, 2 bed $906/month    
Reserved for graduate students only. Not exactly on campus, but still run by the university so I thought I'd add it to this list.    
https://housing.ucdavis.edu/solano-park-apartments/ 

##West Village    
Double $770-$870/month, 4 bed $1180/month, 3 bed $1205-$1220/month, 2 bed $1330-$1430/month, 1 bed $2260-$2360/month    
You can only rent out one bedroom at West Village, the # bed described how many bedrooms will be in the apartment for this description, thus it is cheaper for more bedrooms, in this case. This is a very convenient option if you can afford it.    
https://solatwestvillage.com/floorplans 

#Off Campus    
Typically these locations will be cheaper to rent than any on campus option. You will also be further away from the campus and may miss out on parties or seeing friends as often. However, you will still be very close. Transportation options include biking, bus, and depending on where in Davis, walking. To cut costs, many students opt to share bedrooms. You can often look for rooms and roommates on Facebook housing groups. I'm sure someone will post a link in the comments. It is often much easier to find roommates than rooms the closer it gets to the start of the school year, so if you have a deposit down, but a roommate drops out, fret not. You can always find a replacement.    

##East Davis    
Typically the cheaper area of Davis, likely due to proximity to the train tracks (you can hear the train from the MU at times). Close proximity to Grocery Outlet, Food Co-op, the Dollar store, Goodwill and Thrift store.    

###University Square Apartments    
1 bed $1415/month, 2 bed $1695-$1745/month    
No pets. Management is eh.    
http://bacoapartments.com/805/university-square-apartments-apartments-for-rent/davis/95616 

###The Spoke    
1 bed, 2 bed, 2 bed town house    
Pet friendly. Couldn't find prices, will update if I do. Right next to train tracks, can get noisy when the train is coming by. Rooms come furnished. Somewhat classy.    
https://livethespoke.com/ 

###Pennsylvania Place
1 bed $1475/month, 2 bed $1670-$1750/month    
No pets. Right next to the railroad as well, noisy when the train passes by. Kind of a creepy vibe to some, all the doors face inward toward the pool.    
http://bacoapartments.com/848/pennsylvania-place-apartments-for-rent/davis/95616 

###J Street Apartments    
1 bed, 2 bed $1700/month    
Pet Friendly. Again, near the railroad. More upscale.    
https://www.jstapts.com/ 

##North Davis    
Slightly more up scale area of Davis. Easy access to Savemart and Safeway. 

###Alvarado Sunset Apartments    
2 bed $1900-$1950/month, 3 bed $2115/month    
Pet Friendly. Some units are town-house style. Creaky floors, but very open design with pool in the center.    
https://www.apartmenthomeliving.com/apartment-finder/Alvarado-Sunset-Davis-CA-95616-1967587 

##South Davis 

##West Davis

#Out-side of Davis    
Other options include Sacramento and Woodland. These options may be cheaper for those willing to commute to school, however parking will be difficult and will require you to leave very early to be guaranteed a spot. 

#Van Living    
A very cheap option, your only expenses would be fuel, vehicle registration, and of course the van itself. You can utilize the showers at the ARC, which is included in your tuition. You can have an electric or gas burner to use for a cooking surface. Some vans even have built-in generators. Free parking is available on many streets throughout Davis, but you may want to move your van once in a while to avoid arousing suspicion. You can get a parking pass for on-campus parking, but I do not believe this permits overnight parking.        


Please note this list is far from complete. I will try to add more entries, but in the mean time, I hope this helps.

My housemates and I are currently in a 3 bedroom, 2 1/2 bathroom at Sharps and Flats apartments in south davis.  We are planning on going back home for the summer after spring quarter, and so we are looking for people to fill our place in the apartment. 

There are the three bedrooms upstairs, with two full bathrooms (showers) upstairs. Up to 6 people can live here (2 in each room) or as low as 3 people if everyone wants their own room. Anybody is welcome, whether that’s a full group of roomates, or totally random people that each want their own room, or some combination of those. 

The total rent is 2800, which would be $467 if there were 2 people in each room, but we are willing to work with any amount of people that end up living here for the summer and come to an agreement on payment if all the spots don’t end up being filled.  If you or anyone you know is looking for summer housing (maybe summer session students/people between houses/etc.) please let me know.  Also if you would like any other information about the place such as the floor plan, utilities, amenities, etc. please let me know."

I am having a really hard time deciding if I want to pursue a major in biological systems engineering or environmental engineering (the major I am currently in right now). I am really interested in anything related to sustainability and using/creating technology to treat environmental problems but from what I see from environmental engineering, it is way more similar to civil than I thought where you are creating large scale projects and infrastructure which is pretty cool but not exactly what I imagine myself doing in the future. I talked to a major advisor &amp; she told me that BSE seems to be more about smaller projects such as creating biofuel, working with enzymes, etc. with a more equal balance of bio &amp; engineering rather than EENV where it is much more about engineering. Anyway, I am wondering what it is like for anyone in the major or graduated from the major? Are the majors more similar than I think? What exactly does this major entail job-wise? If I do pursue BSE, can I still go do EENV work or is it too broad? Vice versa can I do BSE work with an EENV degree? I’M SO STRESSED!"

But for some fucking reason, it said I failed to meet the requirement. I'm absolutely dumbfounded how I could fail it. 
The only think I can think of is that they set the bar to 90% or higher = passing, so they can force people to take an extra class they don't need.

I was requesting a Lyft to the Amtrak station, and was in quite a rush. So I requested it and kinda just left my phone while I quickly finished packing my stuff. And then when I went to grab my phone, YOU WERE THE LYFT DRIVER WITH YOUR SILVER TOYOTA PRIUS and I couldn't believe it. So naturally, I freaked out and cancelled the trip and went onto Uber instead 😂

I thought about this encounter a lot because first off LOL I wanted to accept the date but I think I was caught off guard and was too nervous to say yes. Anyway, this was like 2 yrs ago, so I wouldnt be surprised if the person I encountered ever saw this."

We waste 50 hours on the DL and all we get is a potential +3% to your grade. Even then, a maximum of +10% bonus can be given to the whole class, which means pretty kuch nobody gets any bonus as each classroom consists of 20+ students. It's lucky if only half the students get a +1% bonus.

I don't care how hard the subject is, or how bad the lecturers are. I can study myself and get good grades no problem, but what grinds my gears is all the time wasting during DLs. The TA explains the stuff one by one to each and every table rather than just explaining it to the whole class. Even if we are done with the activity, the teacher wastes 10+ each and every question just so that they can finish ""in time"". Yes, they take the class slow on purpose just to finish in time even if the material is only 30 minutes worth of work.

I'm sick of it. I won't mind if it is graded like bio and Chem labs, but wasting 5 hours a week without getting graded at all is retarded.

I get that Math Statistics is generally a difficult topic since you applied a lot of the material you've learned in Calculus, but with proofs; it's just that the only difference is that STA 130 is a brief and slightly easier version of STA 131, but are still pretty rigorous classes to take within the major.

And some of you made some decent arguments; namely that the administration deciding to slow/stop the flow of students from China in favor of American public safety wouldn't even matter until next Fall quarter when new admits come in. Which makes sense, until you consider that the thousands of Chinese foreigners already here likely traveled back home during the holidays, and then back to the US, right before the outbreak.

I recently learned that the 5th confirmed case of the virus [here](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-health/2020/01/28/asu-bans-travel-china-students-faculty-after-new-coronavirus-case/4599991002/) in our country [is now at ASU](https://www.foxnews.com/health/coronavirus-case-asu-petition-cancel-classes) precisely because the people who think like me over there listened to the people who think you like guys. And now may god have mercy on their souls.

This is one of the things that would seem really fucking obvious in retrospect. In any case I hope they get it contained, but people need to realize that this thing is extremely contagious, and has already spread beyond the SARS outbreak 15 or so years ago."

Hey Aggies!  

I was inspired by this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/2d7eh8/campus_improvement_suggestions_for_asucd/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) from a couple years ago to make this because I feel it has became a relevant question to ask the students of UC Davis about. As a member of ASUCD, I really want to get beyond the tiring and childish political games the slates (parties on campus) are playing with each other and get down to the nitty gritty of what the student body actually wants us to do. In the end, I’d just rather make an actual effort to improve the environment here at Davis then to twiddle my thumbs fighting over irrelevant slate drama.

So what do you guys want us to realistically fix here at Davis or improve? And honestly any feedback, negative or positive, is welcome in this thread.

Today I got an email and I was pretty nervous about it. Here's what it said:

&gt;Thank you for informing UC Davis in your TAG that you would not be a full-time student in Spring 2020.  Your TAG indicates you would be full-time in Winter 2020; however, your Transfer Academic Update (TAU) indicates you dropped two (2) courses and will end the Winter quarter with four (4) units.  Please explain why you are less than full-time in Winter 2020.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;We must receive this information within five (5) calendar days of this message date, or processing of your application may be delayed or canceled. 

There was a link that led me to a page to submit my date of birth and I immediately submitted a response with these grounds:

* I already have over 100 units with a very high GPA and my GE and major preparation courses are all done (because I took 20+ units last year for some quarters). There's no need to take other unnecessary classes if you don't need to.
* I am working as a student tutor (though less than 10 hours per week).
* My grandmother is sick and I'm busy taking care of her.

Has anyone ever gotten their TAG revoked for not being full-time because they already fulfilled all requirements early? Would the grounds of my situation be a good explanation?

When I submitted this, I also got no confirmation of such, so I got even more nervous!!!!!! Is that normal?

Thank you so much!"

Freshman year: to my dorm roommate who always had guys over, but would never tell me and then hello I walked in on you having sex like multiple times, F*CK YOU! It was to a point where I would come back to the dorm room at like 2am and then leave at 7am because I wanted to avoid you as much as possible. I was also put on Subject to Dismissal this yr and honestly was almost okay with being dismissed bc I lowkey depressed and didnt wanna be in this environment anymore. But I stayed, and here we are now.

Sophomore yr: this year was definitely a yr of growth for me. My housemate attempted suicide and the rest of the housemates and myself were the first responders to the situation. Having to call a parent and tell them that they're child is trying to kill themselves is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. Unfortunately, the housemate ended up going down a road of reckless behaviors which we had to address and have her move out of the place for everyone's safety. That was one of the roughest times, feelings and emotions that I would never wish upon anyone. I was, again, Subject to dismissal, but again, here I am LOL. Ironically, I ended this year with straight As and landed 2 internships. 

Third year: I would say my third yr was the first time that everything was normal. And because things finally normalized, I felt like what I had gone through the past few yrs finally settled in. Not only that, but a chance to reflect on my life experiences dating back to childhood. And because of this, I struggled a ton with my mental health. It was to the point where I would call off work, skip class, and just stay in bed with hot cheeto crumbs everywhere because that's the only thing I could be bothered to eat. I began suicide ideation, all I could think about was dying, and all my jokes were super dark. And then, it transitioned into planning my suicide and wanting to act upon that. I struggle from depression, anxiety, and PTSD. I think those are things I may have been struggling with a while now, but was just barely addressing now. Whilst all of this was happening, idk how I did it, but those two internships offered me employment and idk why i did it, but i took them both. 

Fourth yr: this year has been about love, and that sad person I was just a few months ago, is someone I can hardly recognize now. I know that sounds so trivial and ew, but really. Love for my amazing friends who've stuck with me throughout undergrad. Love for my mom who has been my #1 fan. Love for my coworkers who make going to work fun. Love for my fave lil shop in Davis, Newsbeat, that legit has me fawning everytime I'm in there. Love for a stroll thru the Arboretum to clear my mind. Love for myself. I've hit rock bottom in more ways than I wouldve wanted, and honestly didn't know if I could make it. This morning, I submitted my application to graduate and it's getting surreal. Honestly, I probably wont miss Davis all that much because I've been scarred to life with this place, but it was a 4 yrs of life that taught me lots about myself and the world, and I wouldn't trade that for anything ."

I'm starting a new scanlation circle focused on adult doujinshi and manga.

Have you ever wanted to have a part in producing high quality *material* for the English doujinshi fan community at large? Are you interested in scanlating, but don't know where to start? Are you a seasoned eromanga connoisseur who's had experience in working with other scanlation groups? Or do you just want to pick up a hobby and make friends with like-minded people? If so, then this is the place for you!

Let me start by introducing myself. I'm konomu, a student here at UC Davis, and I have several years of experience independently translating and editing a multitude of raw scans, posting them online mainly on the e-hentai galleries. I've also previously worked within the bounty system of that website and translated a short novel, so I've picked up a fair amount of knowledge of how scanlating works. I translate from Japanese to English. Obviously, konomu isn't my real name—we aren't a registered student organization with the UC Davis CSI, so there's no need to reveal your offline identity. Everything concerning the scanlations can be done purely online under anonymity, although I'll make it so that it's possible to schedule a meetup if the situation calls for it.

**Why adult manga and doujinshi?**

Popular non-H manga have a tendency to run for many volumes over long periods of time. Fans who follow these scanlation groups also expect timely releases shortly after the original language version is published. In contrast, people who translate adult manga and doujinshi are generally free to pick up a work several months (and occasionally years) after its initial release. We're all busy college students here, and all too often real life stuff such as homework get in the way of hobbies. By limiting our projects to adult doujinshi, we have much more freedom in handling them.

**What do I need to join?**

In order to join the group, you need two things: a passion for maintaining quality in your work, and a skillset which will determine your role. Members will be assigned at least one role in the group to their choosing. A general overview of the roles that'll be available is in the comments section.

**Will I get paid?**

Please be aware that working with the group will not warrant a salary or any monetary profit. Because scanlation heavily incorporates the work of other artists, it is unethical to profit off of it. This project will be done purely for the heck of it. If you're expecting money, please don't attempt to join.

**What kind of doujinshi/manga are we going to work on?**

The works can either be provided through a designated scanner, or picked from the existing pool of raws and digital galleries on the e-hentai network. Our finished works will also be posted on the e-hentai network. E-hentai and its sister exhentai is the largest online host of digital adult manga and doujinshi. It usually has its galleries pulled and uploaded to other sites, one notably popular aggregate being nhentai. Members can bring up galleries they want translated, and if everyone agrees that they want to work on it as a group, we'll start scanlating it. We will not be scanlating any shota/loli content. You won't be forced to work on anything that you don't want to work with.

As of the time I'm posting this, Doujin Aggies consists of—just me. Hentai manga isn't exactly easy conversation material to bring up with other people on campus, especially in public. But hey, that's exactly why I started this group, to meet new people here that share my interests.

If you have any questions on how the group will function, please feel free to leave a comment or directly message me and I'll answer them. If you're interested in joining, do the same and I'll respond with a link to the group's discord. There, we can discuss the details of the project. Hope to see you there!

I woke up on Monday about to head to class when I noticed my bike wasn’t at the spot I left it at, which is outside my apartment complex. What was left was a broken u-lock dangling from the bike rack. I really love that bike. It was a white frame single speed bike with red wheels. I don’t normally leave my bike outside, but recently with the rain and me constantly using it. It have got warned down, so I decided to lock it outside. I was pretty confidence that it wouldn’t get stolen because I saw bikes like mine on the bike rack for weeks in the same spot. To be safe I even wrapped chains around the back wheels, which were connected to the u-lock on the front wheel. Now that it’s gone I don’t know what to do.  Due to my bike being gone I decided to buy a $124 bike from Walmart as a replacement thinking that this one might not get stolen, but I don’t feel comfortable riding that bike. It’s heavy, small, slow, and the front wheel already start making noises. I don’t know if this is weird or not but I feel like the bike doesn’t suit me and I don’t feel like riding my new bike to school for the next few years. I also have an old old bike back at home that has a huge hole on one of its tire, warned down brakes, and wobbly wheels that I wouldn’t mind riding again. (This was the bike that I used before I got the single speed bike.) Now that I explained to you situation, I need help making a decision. Do I suck it up and stick with the Walmart bike or should I drive home(2 hours away) pick up my old old bike and refund my Walmart bike and see if bike repair shops like Green Bicycle Shop can repair it. The cons of this option is that I don’t know if the shops can repair it or not and I don’t want to waste time driving back and forth just to get nothing accomplish or have to wait a few days for them to order parts online to repair my bike and it’s also midterm seasons and I don’t want to deal with bike problems while I’m trying to study for my midterms. Or I can round up some of my savings(refunding Walmart bike and adding up other savings) and buying a new single speed bike($250) again and risk losing it, but this time I’m going to bring it into my apartment rather than locking it outside. The only risk is if someone decided to steal my bike at school while I’m in my class.(My latest class ends at 6PM) I don’t know what to do and I need some guidance. Any help would be appreciated."

I know, the search bar exists. I have looked at the similar questions and answers posted about this, and it seems like it is possible to do so, so long as you have a 3.0 UC GPA by 1 quarter, have less than 135 units, and finish the prereqs on this website:

 [https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/undergraduate/cs/change-of-major/](https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/undergraduate/cs/change-of-major/) 

However, I want to be absolutely sure that it's possible for transfers. That site mentions nothing about transfers, so part of me thinks that it's for non-transfers only. Other UCs, like UCI or UCSB, are very strict and allow no major change into CS or some other engineering major. Also, even if Davis is lenient with this, it could/could've changed, so I'd like to know the most current policy on this. 

I have most of the ECS prereqs done with A's, and I would apply for CS, but I do not meet the transfer requirements. My math 21ABC GPA is not a 3.40 thanks to one mistake in my very first semester, so I kinda have to apply for a different major. 

I wonder if this issue would also prevent me from switching. When I submit a petition to switch, will they look at my CC transcript, see that I haven't fulfilled their official CC transfer requirements (3.40 in 21ABC), and deny me even if I have the 3.0?"

I'm wondering if there are any artists around who would be interested in doing a commissioned painting. I need something to fill the empty wall space in my living room and I am very drawn to large paintings.

In particular a painting of my dog would mean a lot to me. He's an 8 month old tri-color corgi who thinks he's king of the world. I'm very open to different creative/painting styles, we can go in a lot of directions with this.

If anyone's interested in doing this for a class assignment, or just has the time and interest I'd be really excited. Please reach out!

Thanks :)"

This quarter has been the absolute WORST. Lots of personal growth but I'll be beyond relieved when it's over. Thanks for the help and advice Aggies!"

I'm a little concerned about financing. I've gone over the expenses with my landlord, and this apartment isn't as cheap as I'd like it to be (~$1300 a month w/utilities) its still much cheaper than housing through SHA (varies, $4100-$6000 depending on quarter), and it guarantees summer housing.

I do receive a little bit of financial aid which covers most tuition and I've had to take out loans just for housing. Someone told me that financial aid is reduced quite a bit if you live off campus. My landlord assured me that even if my financial aid is reduced, I will likely be spending less money per quarter. If I was spending less than $1000 a month this would make more sense to me, but I'm very uncertain with how much I'll be paying.

I have until tomorrow to submit an application for this apartment, and less than a week to back out SHA.

Any suggestions?

I'm also a little worried about paying rent over the summer. Im hoping I won't have to repeat classes over the summer (there is a possibility for one class) but I would like to stay and do my senior project so I wouldn't have to wait to do it in the Fall, when I'd have classes. My grandma is offering to let me stay those months, but it's like $40 a day for transportation and a 3-4 hour commute. I don't know if my mentor wants me on campus every day this project so I will have to discuss that with them."

Currently I bike to campus on a cheap fixie and lock it w/ a standard U-lock. 

Next year I’ll be living further from campus and want to convert my mountain bike into and ebike and commute on that. Now my mountain bike alone is already a higher target for theft, more so once I add a motor and battery to it. 

My only concern is theft. My thinking is that if I park it inside at night, and use two heavy duty locks (like kryptonite chain and abus folding lock) on campus during the day, I should be decently safe from getting my bike stolen. Nobody’s gonna take a grinder to a bike lock in the middle of the day on campus right? I also plan on removing the battery and taking it into class with me, and using pinhead locks on wheels, seat, etc. 

Another option is renting out a space in the bike cage @ the MU parking garage, but it’d be nice being able to park right outside of my classes. 

What do y’all think?"

Could you help us understand how emotions buffer people against stress experienced by immigrants?  


To participate in this study, you need to be 

1.       International students or second-generation immigrant and

2.       In college or graduate school

You will only take some short online surveys (25 minutes long). We don't collect any information on immigration status or physical address. 1 in 5 participants will win a $25 Amazon gift card. We also got IRB approval. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**This research can help identify more protective factors for immigrants with fewer resources.**  **Further , this study hopes to contribute to reducing health disparities in immigrant families.**  If you are willing to help, please reach me by direct message.

Thank you very much!"

But on schedule builder, I noticed 9D has, instead of the standard two-hour lab and 1-hour discussion, just an hour+20minute discussion (whatever that'll be) and is 4 units instead of 5, which now has me conflicted. There's also the fact that I dont know if AATC PHY 9 drop-in will be available during the summer.

How is PHY 9D, both in general and compared to the 9ABC? For those who have taken it, would you recommend taking it during spring or summer?

I already submitted a question to UC Davis's Undergraduate Scholarship office, but I would like to know if anyone here has a similar experience, particularly as a transfer student.

I'm a UC Davis alum, class of '07 for undergrad in Env. Policy Analysis and Planning (EPAP), minor in Managerial Economics and graduated in '08 with a MS in Ag. Resource Economics.  I'm currently working in tech in a Business Operations function.

As I progress in my career, I realize I really enjoy helping people early in their career.  The most tangible help I can provide is helping some folks spruce up their resume.  Using that as a starting point, I am also hoping I can help folks think about what they want to do with their career and set tangible goals.

**My Ask:**  I'm looking for 1-2 people who might need some help with their resumes as they are starting to look for a job in their field.

**Full Disclosure:**  I am hoping to develop this into a side hustle, and eventually a full hustle.  I am gainfully employed, but realize I do working with people who are early in their careers.  Essentially, I am trying to give back the knowledge I've gained through my 10+ years in tech.  Every time I learn something new, I wish I knew it as a senior in college... helpful tips always come to late, and this is my way of getting back

**Full Disclosure 2:**  I am not looking to get paid.  We will set clear expectations and boundaries, for both of us.

Hopefully this post doesn't violate the rules!  Feel free to DM me.  Thanks!"

Also it may seem like mortality rate is low but the CDC did announce that the mortality rate is 2% where is the typical flu has it mortality rate of .1% meaning that the mortality rate for Coronavirus appears to be two hundred times the mortality rate of the flu. Now this thing said there many factors that play a role. Such as age health and nutrition. The likelihood is if you're decent shape and you catch the coronavirus you're just going to be totally okay.

When the UC Davis Medical Center first reached out to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to have this patient tested for the corona virus, they at first refused because the patient did not match the profile they were looking for, that being a person who has recently traveled to China or has come into contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19. When they finally agreed to test this patient and discovered that they do in fact have the corona virus, days had already passed with the medical staff not treating the case as a COVID-19 case meaning that the patient could have had visitors or contact with other people while being hospitalized at the North Bay VacaValley Hospital or even at the UC Davis Medical Center.

&amp;#x200B;

However, this is not the crucial piece of information I am talking about. It is what was left out of ""Message to Campus Community on COVID-19"" that the News and Media Relations of UC Davis put out yesterday. Did anyone read through it and feel like you were missing something?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; As you may be aware, a confirmed case of COVID-19 has been documented in  a Solano County resident who is being treated at UC Davis Medical  Center in Sacramento. This case is being investigated by the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as possibly the first patient with no known exposure to the virus through travel or close contact with a  known infected individual.    
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;To date, no one in Yolo County or on the UC Davis main campus has tested  positive for COVID-19. We do want you to know, however, that out of an  abundance of caution, three members of the campus community who had been living in Kearney Hall are currently in isolation. The CDC is testing  one of them for COVID-19, and this person is not on campus. The other  two individuals are asymptomatic, meaning they are not showing any  symptoms of illness, so, following CDC guidance, they have not been  tested.   
&gt;  
&gt;Source: [https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/message-campus-community-covid-19/](https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/message-campus-community-covid-19/)

&amp;#x200B;

Did you catch it? We know why the CDC did not first want to test the patient at Solano County, because they did not match the profile they were searching for. There has only been ONE confirmed case of COVID-19 in our area, so why is it that in the second paragraph they did not state that the student currently being tested has had no known contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19. 

You  do not have to wait until a negative or positive result to give us this piece of crucial information, that being, whether the student who is  currently being tested has had any known contact with someone carrying  the disease.

It is so standard, but they omitted it. There is only one person with a confirmed case of COVID-19 in our area so if this student doesn't know that person, you can easily say, “As  of now, we are not aware of whether the person has had any contact with any individual carrying COVID-19, and are awaiting the results from the  CDC.”

This  is all they would have to say unless they know that the student  currently being tested was definitely in contact with a confirmed case of  COVID-19. But they didn't. I urge you to read through the whole press release. 

&amp;#x200B;

They say out of an ""abundance of caution,"" but don't tell us what is prompting this caution. People up and down our campus our sick from the common cold and the flu and caution isn't moving them to have them tested by the CDC as well. What is so special about these three students? 

&amp;#x200B;

It's obvious that the student who is being tested for COVID-19 has had confirmed contact with an individual carrying the disease, the CDC is not testing people otherwise. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that the university does not want to create hysteria and I understand that the university just wants to finish out the quarter, but when it comes to matters of health, you should trust the student and faculty body and give us the full picture.

&amp;#x200B;

That say disingenuous press release that UC Davis released was shameful."

Here are some links if you wish to read the literature on the matter, they are in particular order. The question remains, do you think that UC Davis Should take preemptive measures to stop the spread of COVID-19 and shut down the school?"
fb7w08,Some information and advice about Covid-19 from a doctor,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/fb7w08/some_information_and_advice_about_covid19_from_a/,AbacusWizard,1,2020-02-28 21:21:37,13,/r/UCDavis/comments/fb7w08/some_information_and_advice_about_covid19_from_a/,NaN,"A wise doctor I know (who is also a former Aggie, go UCD!) wrote this recently and I thought you folks might find it useful to read.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Hey all, I've been seeing a whole lot of worry about Covid-19 on here, so I figured maybe I'd share my thoughts…  
&gt;  
&gt;First, the bad. This thing is happening. It's already spreading in the community. Pretty much everyone is going to be exposed, most people will contract it.  
&gt;  
&gt;But! I have a sneaking suspicion that the 20% severe disease/2% death rate is inflated. It is based on cases in Wuhan, where healthcare facilities are desperately overwhelmed and undersupplied. Moreover, there's no way that everyone who's mildly ill is being tested or even coming to anyone's attention. While it is still a formidable disease that should not be underestimated, it will hopefully not be \*as\* bad here, if we can keep up with it.  
&gt;  
&gt;That said, here is what you can do:  
&gt;  
&gt;1) Wash. Your. Hands. Often. Don't touch your face. Lather, rinse, repeat.   
&gt;  
&gt;2) If you have a chronic condition, get it under control! Diabetic and your blood sugar's a bit high? Hypertensive and your blood pressure isn't what it should be? Asthma been acting up? Yeah, get that taken care of NOW. This virus is worse for the elderly and those with chronic conditions. Oh, and if you smoke, quit. It's nailing smokers too.   
&gt;  
&gt;3) Have supplies on hand in case you need to be quarantined for 2 weeks and can't leave the house. That includes food, meds, pet food, pet meds, toilet paper. . .anything you'd miss after 2 weeks. Don't hoard, though! That helps no one, including you, because let's be honest, you don't even really know what you'd be hoarding for.   
&gt;  
&gt;4) On that note, masks won't really save you. Surgical masks don't prevent healthy people from getting sick, but they do help sick people contain their germs. Save the masks for them. We've had people stealing masks from the hospital and clinics recently. Don't do that! You \*want\* your health care professionals to stay healthy at work. We make sure YOU stay healthy! And if we're sick, we can't take care of you.  
&gt;  
&gt;5) If you think you might have been exposed or you're ill with the coronavirus, call ahead to your doctor's office for instructions. Don't just show up. Yeah, I know Kaiser lets you book an appointment online and waltz in with no triage. Other systems probably do too. Don't do that! Tell them you're coming, and you're worried because you have a fever and a cough. Let them mask you at the door and take you straight to an appropriate exam room.   
&gt;  
&gt;6) Get a flu shot. Flu is still killing people this season. I don't want any of you to be amongst them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Stay safe out there, and as the Hitchhiker's Guide reminds us, Don't Panic.

Also, I want to especially emphasize the recommendation to wash your hands often. With soap. You should all be doing that already anyway, seriously."

Both the women and men will be playing today, with high seeds in the conference tournament on the line!

**WBB: UC Davis vs UC Riverside**

*Time: 2:30PM*

*Stream:* [*Big West TV*](https://bigwest.org/watch/default.aspx?Live=2816&amp;path=uc_davis)

*Radio:* [*KDVS*](https://kdvs.org/)

After defeating Hawaii last week, the Ags are now solely in 1st place in the conference and a full two games ahead of Hawaii. A win today clinches a Big West co-championship -- the fourth such title in a row for the Ags. Win more of the remaining games and the Ags can guarantee a spot in the postseason WNIT tournament and first in the conference tournament, which will help for qualifying for the Women's NCAA tournament.

However, Riverside won't be an easy opponent; even though they're last in the conference they stunned UCD early in the season in Socal. The Highlanders will be extremely confident that they can win this game, whereas UCD will be looking for revenge.

This is also senior night, where Sophia Song, Nina Bessolo, and Katie Toole will be honored for their contributions to one of the greatest dynasties a UCD program has formed in the D1 era. Song and Bessolo were instrumental players in the rotations for virtually all four years they were here, while Toole has been a breakout star for the new-look Aggies this year. Come cheer them on!

*Prediction: UC Davis 66, UC Riverside 60*

The men have had possibly the more intriguing season as -- despite not seeming dominant early and now having few players from the conference-winning teams of years past -- they find themselves in the top half of conference. UC Irvine is untouchable in first, but with a good stretch of play at the end here the Ags could shock the conference with a second or third place finish and be in prime position to steal an NCAA tournament bid from the Anteaters.

LBSU looks beatable based on their record, but they're only slightly below Davis in the standings and they'll come to play. Earlier in the season, the Ags barely eeked out a win at Long Beach by 3, and I expect another gritty, close game here.

Unlike the women's game, what happens elsewhere in the conference will matter almost as much this game as the result in the Pavilion. Should Hawaii and CSUN fall today, the Ags could move up as high as alone at third in the standings going into the last two games. UCSB is also likely to lose at Irvine, putting tied at second on the table as well.

Watch for freshman phenom Ezra Manjon to make is usual mark on the game and offer a preview of the stellar things to come for the Ags. Meanwhile, senior Stefan Gonzalez, one of the top 3-pt shooters in the nation, will look to keep his hot hand and propel the Ags to victory.

*Prediction: UC Davis 80, Long Beach State 79*"

Hi guys! I'm doing research on student food insecurity at UCD, and I'm in need of responses for my survey. The data will be used for an assignment in my UWP 101 class. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. And if you fill this out, I'd really appreciate it!!!! PS. it's only a few questions."
fbqyq0,Transfer Fall 2020 - Question about Organic Chemistry series,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/fbqyq0/transfer_fall_2020_question_about_organic/,StarsAndTakoyaki,1,2020-02-29 23:58:30,6,/r/UCDavis/comments/fbqyq0/transfer_fall_2020_question_about_organic/,NaN,"Has anyone transferred to UCD with only half of the organic chemistry series completed? I called admissions and they said I’m okay to drop the second half (i’m highkey failing rn because i have a lot on my plate ahaha).

I believe that the series is divided into 3 quarters from what someone in my class told me. My community college is semester based so I believe that I would need to complete the last two parts of the series at university? Admissions was unclear and didn’t really know himself :(

Does this put me behind for my plan to graduate in two years? I’ve completed my IGETC already so I just need to take my science courses for my major. I haven’t done Physics yet easier :("
