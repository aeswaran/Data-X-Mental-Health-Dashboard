eating out is very difficult and expensive


In a typical area,

You find few outlets selling pizza or burger,
And you find a restaurant in which meals are quite expensive,
And that's it,

Here you have : only few foods, and they are expensive

You are able to eat almost nothing,

Eating out is nearly impossible


Do you guys see ?

This model is very inefficient


Something Big is missing

It is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, chefs also rotate

This restaurant is going to serve thousands of foods over the course of time

A meal is going to be cheap

Eating out will finally become possible


Such restaurant is crucially needed"

ACT: 34 (I'm thinking about not submitting this though because what's the point)

GPA: UW - 4.12/4.33 (4.33 is all A+s) and W - 5.15/6 (6 is all A+s taking only AP classes so it's literally not possible to get a 6)

ECs: President of BioBuilder Club (Bioengineering) for two years, President of Music Production Club (sophomore year), President of Key Club (community service), Senior Class Vice President, Vice President of the Orchestras for two years, elected student council rep for 3 years and chair of school works committee, secretary of orchestra sophomore year 

In BioBuilder Club we're working on a project that I proposed to counter UV-induced protein damage by linking a UV-activated genetic promoter with chaperonin genes. We've worked with Cornell graduate students several times on the project. 

This year I'm creating a program to connect high school STEM clubs with elementary schoolers to introduce the kids to fields of science that they may have never heard of before or interacted much with before (Bioengineering, scientific computing, programming, robotics, etc. ) 

I might also found a climate change non-profit but I haven't thought much about that one.

I also work two jobs: At McDonald's and at my local Farmer's Market as a parking attendant. 

Awards: Bausch and Lomb Honorary Science Award, Kiwanis Award (community service).....apscholarwithdistinctionlmao i might just include that because i haven't won many awards.

Also I play five instruments and I've been an area all state and stuff.

One thing I've noticed as I've read about experiences at Princeton is that while some love it, others... don't. I've seen complaints of social stratification and people who feel very isolated amongst their peers.

I guess the thing that's most important to me is a sense of community and belonging to wherever I end up. I know that most people will definitely feel that while at Princeton, but I'm curious about the experiences of the people who don't.

So, /r/princeton, what's your experience? Are you happy? Could you tell me about people you've known who weren't happy and why? How about times when you've seen/felt exclusion or stratification?

# **if we had these 2 options:**

1. remembering everything but feeling and valuing differently

2. feeling and valuing the same sort of things but remembering nothing

then what would you choose?

most of us would choose the 2nd one


this shows that our values are more important than our memories, as values are the resulting effects

**heres a simple example of values &amp; value priorities**

when we make the claim 'There is no money in poetry'

- this shows &amp; reveals a bias that we have

- since there is no poetry in money either, and yet we dont say that

that's 'the standard story of action' from princeton

**given this, i'd not assume and falsely imagine cultural  ideas of agency, freedom, choice, self-determination, or other made up ideas**

- since i dont believe in these made up ideas anymore, i cannot talk in a way that assumes these made up ideas to actually be scientific facts in life, since there is no evidence 

**ppl in many culture &amp; nations live their life without the assumptions of these ideas of agency, freedom, choice, self-determination, etc**

- so this indicates that living without these falsely imagined ideas is possible



**we also do not know if everything was causally deterministic, but if everything were, then we would be sure that there's no agency, choice, and freedom etc**

in physics, some things are causally deterministic, and some things arent

likely more than 50% of all things are not causally deterministic, and that by itself doesnt mean that agency, choice, and freedom exist



**if there were such imagined things as   agency, choice, and freedom, then to what extent is this agency choice &amp; freedom limited or constrained?**

nobody knows but we know it's highly limited &amp; constrained 

- we have no idea if an action is 'intentional' or not, be that our own or actions of others 

- without knowing if something is  intentional, we have no idea if this action is based on our control or not


**not only do we not know the extent, but dont know the minimal requirements of having agency, etc**

&gt; Nonetheless, it falls short of giving us everything we have reason to expect from account of personal autonomy.

&gt; In particular, challenges to different approaches sketched above suggest that they do not spell out the minimal conditions under which person’s exercise of authority over how she behaves reflects her own power to determine how she exercises this authority.

&gt; Minimal self-state seems to require nothing more nor less than being power behind whatever reasoning directly gives rise to one’s behavior.
Yet none of the accounts we have canvassed here seems to capture this important, most basic, form of self-state.

- see https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/personal-autonomy/#ChalIdenMiniCondPersAuto



**there are external (like gravity) &amp; internal factors (like from neuroscience) that all limit &amp; constrain our options, choices &amp; control over our destiny &amp; our lives**

As reported by *Newsbusters,* religion and African-American Studies prof [**Eddie Glaude**](https://religion.princeton.edu/people/faculty/core-faculty/eddie-glaude/)asked “MSNBC Live” host Craig Melvin whether African-American high schoolers [**would have been given**](https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/kristine-marsh/2019/01/23/msnbc-claims-anyone-wearing-maga-hat-looking-fight-covington-kids) the opportunity to defend themselves in the media just as the Covington boys were:

&gt;I think more than anything, underneath some of the backlash against hearing the young man is this question, who are allowed the innocence of childhood, right?…Why do we always do this in these sorts of cases, when white boys are involved, and what do we do, how do we react when brown and black kids are involved?  
So underneath this is this sense of hypocrisy. Underneath this is a double standard. Underneath this is that we give privilege to these white kids. He can sit down with Savannah Guthrie and redeem himself, but then there are all these other folk who we just presume, you know, who aren’t so innocent.

Glaude followed up by chastising the boys for not taking “responsibility for what happened,” and then responded to Melvin’s accusation that the high schoolers “were inviting a confrontation” via the wearing MAGA hats … by invoking actress Alyssa Milano:

&gt;There was a sense in which the hat announced a certain set of political commitments. Alyssa Milano \[…\] I think described the hat as a modern day white sheet. I think that’s how she described it. The hat in some ways for many of us a kind of racial animus…Make America great again \[sic\] is a kind of nostalgic longing for the 1950s…which black people were to stay in their place, where browns were to stay in their place, and white people were to be treated differently and valued according to the color of their skin.

The professor went on to repeat the accusation — [**made only**](http://hillsdalecollegian.com/2019/01/lessons-from-covington-hs/) by the Native activist at the center of the controversy, Nathan Phillips — that the boys chanted “build the wall,” and that they subjected a passing female to catcalls … though the teen in the video [**does not attend Covington**](https://millennialpolitics.co/new-covington-catholic-footage-shows-teenager-yelling-its-not-rape-if-you-enjoy-it/).

The Greek word *historia* means an inquiry or narrative into the events of the past. Instead, Prof. Painter has written a deconstruction of what she considers the false and oppressive “social construct” of race, which was invented “by dominant peoples to justify their domination of others.” She starts with ancient Europe, where she asserts there was no such thing as white people because no one thought in terms of race. She admits that some people had lighter skin than others, but that no one attached any meaning to it. Then she skips to the Enlightenment, where, she claims, race and whiteness were invented, and devotes most of the book to what she considers the crackpot science of race that flourished from about 1780 to 1930.

&amp;#x200B;

Professor Painter also denies that there is any such thing as white history, white culture, or white civilization. “Whiteness,” she tells us, “is merely a “category of non-blackness,” “the leavings of what is not black” — in other words, pure negation. Prof. Painter’s goal is to make whites a non-people by denying their existence and erasing their history. Needless to say, *The History of White People* has been respectfully reviewed rather than denounced as a breathtaking dismissal of an entire people.

Prof. Painter writes that her book belongs to the new field of “white studies,” which was established in the 1990s. It is more cult than academic discipline, and is based on denial of the obvious. “Today,” Prof. Painter announces, “biologists and geneticists . . . no longer believe in the physical existence of races — though they recognize the continuing power of racism (the belief that races exist, and that some are better than others).” She also writes that “each person shares 99.9 percent of the genetic material of every other human being,” and dismisses skin color as a superficial adaptation to the strength of the sun. Having disposed of both science and common sense in just a few sentences, she warns that we must retain the “category” of race only long enough “to strike down patterns of discrimination.” Race is a myth but “racism” is real.

elldk1,Snoop Dogg for Princeton University's Class Day Speaker 2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/princeton/comments/elldk1/snoop_dogg_for_princeton_universitys_class_day/,snoopdoggadvocate,1,2020-01-07 17:28:57,3,/r/princeton/comments/elldk1/snoop_dogg_for_princeton_universitys_class_day/,NaN,"For far too long, Princeton University's Class Day has hosted a steady stream of academics, actors, politicians, and other people. We claim to attend an elite university, but no university can be truly inspiring, illuminating, and thought-provoking when it invites a riff-raff of normie Class Day speakers.

The previous years we've had actress Ellie Kemper, senator Cory Booker, director Baz Luhrmann, and novelist Jodi Picoult; however, none of these speakers' accomplishments are comparable to the magnificent Snoop Dogg (aka Snoop Lion).

Snoop Dogg is an iconic rapper who has changed the culture of the hip hop throughout his dynamic career. Being nominated for over 17 Grammy's (should've won 17...), selling over 35 million albums worldwide, and making hits like ""Drop It Like It's Hot"" makes Snoop Dogg more than qualified to deliver a brilliant and evocative speech to the Princeton community. Snoop Dogg's experiences are so unique that he even set the Guinness World Record for the largest paradise cocktail. Now that's a man that Princeton needs to learn from.

Be the change you want to see in the world and sign and support this petition. The voices and opinions of the Princeton undergraduate need to be heard.

TL;DR: Vote Snoop Dogg for Princeton's Class Speaker (sign the petition and like the FB page)

Hey, guys! I'm looking to transfer from a public school for the upcoming fall semester but I can only apply to a maximum of three schools due to time constraints. The first time around, I didn't really consider what school I would be happy at or what would be the best fit for me - I wanted the best value and so I ended up at my best state school but I'm not really enjoying it. My parents are willing to send me to a private school if we get enough financial aid, but they want me to find three schools that I love the most and spend my limited time on them. I don't really know what kind of school I'd enjoy, so I was hoping you guys could tell me what separates Princeton from the other Ivyies and top twenty colleges? More specifically, I hope to major in physics and data science/statistics, so I was wondering if there's anything special about those majors, research opportunities in those major, or professors in those majors."

# It’s been over six years since Princeton professor Imani Perry  called the police because I criticized her in a blog post. I have still  not been arrested. But she has! Ain’t karma wonderful?

In July 2013, I wrote [this](https://danfromsquirrelhill.wordpress.com/2013/07/23/dr-imani-perry/) blog post where I criticized a section of [this](https://www.thehairpin.com/2013/07/teaching-trayvon/) article, which had been written by [Imani Perry](https://aas.princeton.edu/people/imani-perry), a professor of African-American Studies at Princeton University.

After I wrote that blog post, I wrote the following email to Dr. Perry:

*“I welcome you to show this to your students and anyone else whom you think might like to read it and comment on it.”*

Dr. Perry responded to my email by writing the following email to me:

*“I will be reporting you to the police for harassment.”*

Prior to this, I had thought that Ivy League universities only hired  professors who were interested in having discussions and debates over  topics with which they disagreed. It had never occurred to me that one  of them would call the police simply because someone disagreed with  something that they had said.

Which is why I was totally shocked to find out that Dr. Perry had called the police on me.

Well, it’s been more than six years since Dr. Perry called the police on me, and I still haven’t been arrested.

In the meantime, I recently did some googling to see what Dr. Perry has been up to.

And it turns out that Dr. Perry herself has been arrested!

It actually happened four years ago, but I just found out about it now.

In February 2016, the New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/us/police-release-video-of-traffic-stop-of-princeton-professor.html):

*The police in Princeton, N.J., released a dashboard video of the traffic stop of a black Princeton professor…*

*The video shows what appears to be a routine traffic stop with the professor, Imani Perry… She was then arrested…*

*After pulling Dr. Perry over, the male officer told her he had clocked her driving at 67 miles per hour in a 45-m.p.h. zone…*

*Fifteen minutes elapsed before the officer returned to her car to tell Dr. Perry that her license had been suspended…*

*About two minutes later, the officer returned to tell her she had a warrant out for her arrest over a parking offense from 2013.*

Ain’t karma wonderful?"

I'm a Questbridge Match student, and I'd be entering as an Aerospace Engineering Major. I'm really curious about anyone's experience with mech/aerospace/engineering in general! 

Most of what I've seen online is so skewed towards the negative because nearly every person ""posting"" about their experience at Princeton will be those complaining. So, I'd like to know from a more neutral standpoint or at least more sources, what the Princeton experience is really like.

You can PM me or message below, but any input would be great!

**Questions:**

1. What are **5 words** you'd use to describe the **best part** of the Princeton community?
2. What are **5 words** you'd use to describe the **worst part** of the Princeton community?
3. Where's your favorite place to **dine**?
4. What would you describe the **""club"" experience** as?
5. How would you describe the ""**feel"" of the campus** and the surrounding area? (i.e. is it lively, quiet, bustling, etc)
6. What do you do in your **free time**? (example: fun classes, sports, hanging out, etc)
7. Do you believe **Princeton's Eating Club's** segment the campus community? If not, what are your thoughts on eating clubs? Is this felt ""split"" in the community felt anywhere else in Princeton?
8. What **drew** you to Princeton?
9. (if applicable) How would you describe the **experience** of a **low-income** student?
10. (if applicable) How would you describe the **engineering experience**? (i.e. primarily theoretical, hands-on, etc)

Thanks for anything guys!"
