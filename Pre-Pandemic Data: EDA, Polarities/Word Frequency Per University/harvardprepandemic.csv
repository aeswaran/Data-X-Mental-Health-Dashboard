I just tried to figure out for what year one does apply, when applying now. I searched on like every site of Harvard itself that has even nearly to do with the process of application. Even the official application form gave me no useful information. On one site I discovered the admission statistics for 2023. That means, that these people who applied last year probably now got their messages if they were accepted for 2023, I guess.

So applying now would mean to attend there in 2024 if accepted, right? And this also means, there is no way to get there in for example 2022?

Dear Members of the Harvard Community,

All of us have been horrified by the revelations regarding Jeffrey Epstein, and I write today to update our community on steps we are taking in view of current information about his philanthropy to Harvard.

Let me start by emphasizing the obvious: Epstein’s reported criminal actions were utterly abhorrent. They flagrantly offend the values of our society and this institution, and we condemn them. We also recognize the profound pain that Epstein caused to his victims and their families, and we commend their courage in coming forward to bring his crimes to light.

Epstein’s connections as a donor to this University, and other institutions, raise important concerns. With that in mind, two weeks ago I asked for a review of his donations to Harvard. Our decentralization makes such a review more complicated than it would be at some other institutions. I want to emphasize that this review is ongoing. Our review to date indicates that between 1998 and 2007, Epstein made a number of gifts to support various faculty and institutional research activities across the University. The largest of these was a $6.5 million gift in 2003 to support the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics. The University received other gifts, which totaled approximately $2.4 million, based on current information. Each of these gifts from Epstein and his affiliated foundations to Harvard University predates his guilty plea in June 2008. To date, we have uncovered no gifts received from Epstein or his foundation following his guilty plea. Moreover, we specifically rejected a gift from Epstein following his conviction in 2008. We have also recently learned that Stephen Kosslyn, a former faculty member and a beneficiary of Epstein’s philanthropy, designated Epstein as a Visiting Fellow in the Department of Psychology in 2005. We are seeking to learn more about the nature of that appointment from Dr. Kosslyn, who no longer works at the University.

The majority of Epstein’s gifts were designated for current use, not as endowed funds, and nearly all were spent years ago for their intended purposes in support of research and education. Our ongoing review of these gifts has identified one current use fund and one small endowment designated to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences with a total unspent balance of $186,000. After consultation with the Dean of the FAS, we have decided that the University will redirect the unspent resources to organizations that support victims of human trafficking and sexual assault. This is an unusual step for the University, but we have decided it is the proper course of action under the circumstances of Epstein’s egregiously repugnant crimes. The issue of the gifts given to institutions by donors at Jeffrey Epstein’s suggestion, is also one that has emerged in recent days, and we are looking into this as part of our ongoing review.

Epstein’s behavior, not just at Harvard, but elsewhere, raises significant questions about how institutions like ours review and vet donors. I will be convening a group here at Harvard to review how we prevent these situations in the future. I also hope to engage our peer institutions to consider how we can collectively improve our processes. We can all learn from each other.

Let me end where I began. Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes were repulsive and reprehensible. I profoundly regret Harvard’s past association with him. Conduct such as his has no place in our society. We act today in recognition of that fact. And we do so knowing that the scourge of sexual assault continues to demand our close attention and concerted action.

Harvard is not perfect, but you have my commitment as president that we will always strive to be better.

Sincerely,
Lawrence S. Bacow

I was recently looking into Harvard University's Extension School and after chatting with one of the school's academic advisors, I still came away with a few questions that perhaps some of you may have the answers to. I suppose the easiest way to do this is to bullet-point them, so here goes...

&amp;#x200B;

* For the ""Earn-Your-Way-In"" admissions, I was thinking of taking the three suggested courses that are on the Extension School's website (EXPO 15, EXPO 25, and MATH E-3). The advisor I spoke to mentioned that they would count towards the degree itself. Any thoughts on this? How were the courses themselves?
* I noticed that there's an on-campus requirement. How was this for folks? Was it a pain trying to find parking/getting a parking pass from the university? (I live a little under an hour north of Cambridge in Maine)
* How were the online classes/courses? I'm no stranger to online learning, but I do know that every school has their own ""spin"" when it comes to online education.
* How's financial aid for the Extension School? I noticed that it was mentioned online, and briefly said by the advisor I spoke with, but is it generous (if needed, I would only be taking sixty-four credits for the degree, as I will have sixty-four credits transferring into the program itself; also, I currently have a 3.67 GPA, if that goes into academic scholarship decision-making). 
* And lastly, for those of whom who have graduated from this program, is it worth it? I've read other comment sections/blogs/posts where some have had difficulties with their degrees, due to the phrasing of the degree itself (""Bachelor of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies,"" even though they majored/concentrated in Environmental Studies), and was just wondering if there was any sort of ""stigma"" attached to the degree, or if the majority of what I read was just a bunch of hot air.

&amp;#x200B;

My apologies for going so long on this post, I just really wanted to make sure I had everything nailed down before I went ahead with a decision! Thank you all for any help/advice/recommendations!"

Mods, please let me know if this post isn’t allowed! 

I’m currently a junior in high school , which means that I’m researching colleges to see where I might like. Harvard, from an academic standpoint, is very reputable and prestigious; they rank at the top in “best college” lists and things like that. However , I was wondering about the general “personality” of the student body. I know at face value, it might sound like a stupid question because how can an undergrad student body of near 7000 all be clones of each other, personality wise? I’m wondering this because I’m trying to find where I think I would fit best mentally and not just prestige wise. 

I was just wondering if there were any general trends/personality traits that stuck out to you that you might be able to characterize the students by. I had heard from a few friends who attend/had attended Harvard that a lot of people can be fake and that it is hard to make friends; is that true? Are there any other “traits” that could generally characterize this student body? 

Thank you!!"

Its just that there's a lot of negativity and hatred on the college subs, so I decided to ask my question to the main source itself.

Did you or anyone you know get into Harvard with a bad SAT (mine's 1300) and average grades, but really good exctracurriculars?
I don't want to believe that I don't have any chance right now if my SAT isn't good. I mean, there must be someone who got in despite that, right?

Please, it would be great help if you guys can advise me if I should apply or not, and if I have any realistic chances. All I want to know is if bad SAT students still get in and if you know anything about them/their apps.

Its not admissions related completely. I just want to know a little about the students who got in.

Thank You!"

d7irgn,New paper rigorously analyzes the data from the Harvard AA lawsuit and finds lots of very interesting stuff about Harvard’s admission process. Details in post.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/d7irgn/new_paper_rigorously_analyzes_the_data_from_the/,KantianCant,33,2019-09-21 17:01:14,26,/r/Harvard/comments/d7irgn/new_paper_rigorously_analyzes_the_data_from_the/,NaN,"Here’s the abstract:

&gt;	The lawsuit Students For Fair Admissions v. Harvard University provided an unprecedented look at how an elite school makes admissions decisions. Using publicly released reports, we examine the preferences Harvard gives for recruited athletes, legacies, those on the dean’s interest list, and children of faculty and staff (ALDCs). Among white admits, over 43% are ALDC. Among admits who are African American, Asian American, and Hispanic, the share is less than 16% each. Our model of admissions shows that roughly three quarters of white ALDC admits would have been rejected if they had been treated as white non-ALDCs. Removing preferences for athletes and legacies would significantly alter the racial distribution of admitted students, with the share of white admits falling and all other groups rising or remaining unchanged.

From Garett Jones on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GarettJones/status/1174854175378874368):

&gt;	Controlling for academic traits and much else, being Asian American predicts a substantially lower probability of Harvard admission… And being female predicts a substantially higher probability of admission.

[Here is a fascinating chart from the paper](https://i.imgur.com/cdyKuxP.jpg) that for some reason isn’t really mentioned in the abstract. One thing that surprised me is that if Harvard removed *all race, legacy and athlete* preferences, the number of white admits would actually rise. Unsurprisingly, Asian admits would skyrocket while African-American and Hispanic admits would tank."

We specialize in business development and marketing.

This product will be a separate entity to what we're already doing but the product will help us bring in more revenue and profits for one of our current businesses while the project will also bring in additional revenue for its own. We've already tried hiring many software developers to build out this product but unfortunately, they are unable to build a software solution that competes in **speed**, **accuracy** and **bypass securities** compared to other few software solutions that can out in the market. Therefore, we're looking for someone specific and someone interested in a partnership. This person should be disciplined, reliable and isn't afraid of failures as this product is hard to build so we guarantee that there will be roadblocks and failures along the journey. They will own 50% of this project and it's non-negotiable. We're looking for someone serious and a LONG-TERM partnership commitment.

This is for someone interested in making money, show off their coding skills, likes to compete with other coders or interested in bypassing security, love to learn, figure things out and making things perfect. We're very confident that there's a high chance of success in terms of generating money if the final product can be built to compete with other few software solutions that are already out in the market.

Please note that many others have tried building a similar software solution out on the market but have failed.

Where’s a place where I could go and just talk to other college students? Any recommendations for student bars or cafes/tea shops? I’ve gone to parks and art museums already...which are really nice for some quiet time. But it would be nice to meet some other people who live in this city before I’m graduating and out. Thanks!"

I’m a first-year, pursuing a major in physics.

I’m extremely interested in doing scientific research as a career, and despite humoring the possibility of becoming a biochemist, psychologist, or even surgeon, I’ve half-assedly decided on physics. Once I took some intro courses, I began to realize how the study could become so interesting to some. I would love to research physics as a career, but I hear that this position is extremely difficult to obtain. Also, and especially if you aren’t one of the lucky, super-intelligent few, you may be stuck in a not-so-lucrative position as an extremely over-qualified person.

Would it be safer to go along with some other science, or should I stick with it? I do want to earn a PhD. in whatever I decide to study, however, I don’t want to be living on the side of the road after having gone to school for ten years earning a whole doctorate in some focus of physics... I would also be pretty resentful if I were to become a software engineer (apparently programming is a popular career for those who are not lucky enough to stay in academics), having just spent those ten years studying something with so much more potential. If I wanted to become a programmer, I would have just gotten some certifications and built a portfolio - significantly cheaper and less rigorous than a PhD. Also, if I may, how do grad students support themselves while completing their masters/doctorates?"

Whenever anyone misinterprets my degree as being more prestigious than it is, even after I explain to them that I went to the Extension School and not the college, I feel like an absolute fraud. 

I guess I wish I had gone to school somewhere where if someone asked where I went, I could just say the university's name and have that be the end of it, not have to qualify my standing there. Like if I'd gone to night school at say, [X] State University, I feel like if someone asked where I went to school I could just say ""[X] State"" and that'd be all I'd have to say. That's my own fault obviously and clearly I should have thought of that before enrolling.

We were something like friends for a bit (just over the phone) which quickly ended when he started hitting on me. No big deal. But he was pretty persistent--too much even. He would call, text, Facetime, etc. I avoided almost all of his contacts except once in a while when I felt bad. For my part, I never explicitly told him to leave me alone. I just assumed if someone calls five times in one day and I don't reply, they would get the hint. My bad I guess.

Anyways, that faded away and I thought I wouldn't have to see him because there are thousands of people here, right? Nope. I see him all the time at my office hours and around campus. But he hasn't made any moves and we're cordial with each other. 

A little while ago, I had this terrifying nightmare. It's faded away since and I don't want to resurface it but he was in it, stalking me, and in the end caught me and started forcing me to do things. I woke up sweaty and terrified. 

But it was just a dream, right?

Today, I saw him. And my blood literally ran cold, I felt clammy and my heart started racing. He smiled at me and I did everything to avoid his eye contact. I've never had someone creep me out like but I can't stand to be anywhere near him.

My logical side feels bad because it's not his fault. It was just a dream. But there's a small part of me that thinks he's a person who might do something horrible like that. I know it's not fair but this was just so fucking weird.

Anyone ever have a creepy experience like this?"

A Harvard administrator’s interview with the campus newspaper is now coming back to haunt the elite university.

A federal judge refused to dismiss a [**sex-discrimination lawsuit**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/harvard-surprised-to-be-sued-twice-for-discriminating-against-single-sex-clubs/) against Harvard by single-sex organizations that have been targeted for accepting only men or women.

When Harvard [**first floated its plans**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/harvards-oldest-male-club-accuses-officials-mccarthyism-coed-mandate/) to penalize final clubs, sororities and fraternities in 2016, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana told [***The Harvard Crimson***](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/4/13/porcellian-club-criticizes-college/) that the unrecognized single-sex groups “remain at odds with the aspirations of the 21st century society.”

A year and a half later, [**Harvard finalized rules**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/harvard-votes-permanently-discriminate-male-female-clubs-protect-inclusivity/) that ban members of “unrecognized single-gender social organizations” from obtaining leadership positions in Harvard student groups or athletic teams. It also made members ineligible to receive Harvard endorsements for prestigious scholarships such as the Mitchell and Rhodes.

“It is certainly plausible that Harvard’s purported ideal of the ‘modern’ man or woman is informed by stereotypes about how men and women should act,” U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton wrote in [**Friday’s opinion**](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.204654/gov.uscourts.mad.204654.39.0.pdf), citing the interview with Khurana (*below*). “Withholding benefits from students who fail to conform to such stereotypes violates Title IX.”

In validating a “plausible claim under a theory of gender stereotyping,” Gorton also cited Harvard’s [**original rationale**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/activists-mad-harvard-says-male-clubs-arent-punished-rape-culture/) for its policy: to stop the sexual assault [**purportedly associated**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/harvards-attack-single-sex-clubs-wrong-illegal-says-expert-fraternity-problems/) with single-sex clubs.

It is also the most sloppy, tendentious, deceitful piece of writing I have seen in a long time. The language alone should raise doubts about the author’s objectivity. He describes me, my work, and associates as “shockingly ugly,” “hateful, dangerous, ancient, and outdated,” “virulently racist,” not to mention “neo-Nazi” and “white supremacist.”

This kind of hysterical name-calling is one thing; outright fabrication is another. People who want to call AR “shockingly ugly” or “virulently racist” find that what it actually says doesn’t come anywhere near justifying their breathless talk, so they start twisting and fabricating. Prof. Sussman is following directly in the footsteps of [Dinesh D’Souza](https://www.amren.com/archives/back-issues/november-1995/#article2).

Some of Professor Sussman’s nonsense is easily exposed. However, the Salon excerpt gives no sources, so even though the entire body of work of [American Renaissance](https://www.amren.com/) is archived online, it is hard to track down exactly what I might have written that could be the basis for this claim, for example: “He \[Taylor\] complains that civil rights laws prohibiting racial discrimination have turned ‘common sense’ into a ‘crime.’ ” One- or two-word “quotations” are always suspect.

We will alert Salon.com and Harvard University Press to Prof. Sussman’s reckless disregard for the truth and ask for a retraction and an apology–short of which we will consider legal action.

I have gone through Prof. Sussman’s article and have highlighted–in order of appearance–only the most prominent outright errors, falsehoods, and distortions, as follows:

**Prof. Sussman: “The American Renaissance Foundation is an extremely conservative right-wing organization that also publishes a monthly magazine of the same name, American Renaissance (AR).”**

There is no American Renaissance Foundation. I am president of the New Century Foundation, which used to publish a monthly magazine called American Renaissance. AR content is now entirely on-line; we stopped publishing a paper magazine more than 2-1/2 years ago.

**Prof. Sussman: “Jared Taylor (1952-)”**

I was born in 1951.

**Prof. Sussman: “the National Policy Institute, a self-styled racist think tank”**

The National Policy Institute, of which I was one of the founding directors, has never described itself as racist.

**Prof. Sussman: “Taylor has close ties with members of various neo-Nazi groups”**

If anyone with whom I have “close ties”–or any ties at all–is a member of a neo-Nazi group, it is news to me. I will expect Prof Sussman to supply details.

**Prof Sussman: “He is a frequent radio guest of Don Black’s . . . .”**

To my knowledge Don Black has never had a radio program. His son, Derek Black, briefly had a radio program on which I appeared once.

**Prof. Sussman: Frédéric Legrand, a member of the National Front, is a frequent contributor to American Renaissance.**

Of the several thousand articles published in AR, Mr. Legrand wrote three. The last one was published seven years ago.

**Prof. Sussman: “One of AR’s and Taylor’s favorite and oft-used quotes, recalling fifteenth-century polygenecist thought, is that of zoologist Raymond Hall from an early issue of Mankind Quarterly: ‘Two subspecies of the same species do not occur in the same geographic area.’ ”**

There is nothing 15th century about the statement, which is widely accepted among biologists. If the gray squirrel is introduced into the red squirrel’s territory, it steadily replaces the red squirrel. [E. Raymond Hall](https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1381544?uid=3739912&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21104805608827) was chairman of the Department of Zoology at the University of Kansas. He made this observation in his two-volume classic, [*The Mammals of North America*](https://www.amazon.com/The-Mammals-North-America-Volume/dp/1930665350), first published in 1959 and revised in 1981. By my count, this quotation from Hall has appeared in three AR articles.

**Prof. Sussman: Taylor believes that slavery may have been wrong but the alternative was “Negro pandemonium.”**

I [wrote](https://www.amren.com/archives/back-issues/november-1995/#article2) that many *slaveholders* believed that the alternative to slavery was, in their words, “Negro pandemonium.” I was expressing their view, not mine.

**Prof. Sussman: “the foundation’s goal is to demonstrate the purported superiority of the white race”**

AR’s consistent position is that races are different. Blacks are superior to whites in many [sports](https://www.amren.com/archives/back-issues/february-2000/#article3), for example, and North Asians are superior to whites in [average intelligence](https://www.amren.com/about/issues/).

**Prof. Sussman offers this sentence as a quotation from AR: “Blacks and Third World immigrants did not really belong in the United States and certainly could not be ‘real’ Americans.”**

This sentence has never appeared in AR.

**Sussman makes much of a poll of AR readers, helpfully adding that the poll was taken “before Obama’s presidency.”**

Indeed, it was taken 17 years ago and consisted of 391 people. Full results are available [here](https://www.amren.com/archives/back-issues/july-august-1997/#article1).

**Prof. Sussman: “Samuel Francis, a regular contributor to AR”**

Samuel Francis has been dead for 10 years.

**Prof. Sussman: “Francis believes that the ‘phony’ rights of nonwhites should be revoked. These include voting, holding office, attending schools with whites, serving on juries, marrying across racial lines, serving in the armed forces, buying homes near whites, and eating at lunch counters with, riding on buses with, holding jobs with, or even associating with ‘superior’ whites.”**

Prof. Sussman has deliberately twisted Francis’s words into their very opposite. Francis [wrote this](https://www.amren.com/archives/back-issues/march-1995/) in 1995: “\[E\]quality before the law, does not mean political equality, the right to vote, or the right to hold political office, let alone social and economic equality, nor the “right” to attend the same schools, to serve on juries, to marry across racial lines, to serve in the armed forces, to eat at lunch counters, to ride on buses, to buy a house or rent a room or hold a job, to receive welfare, to be admitted to colleges and universities, to take academic degrees or to be promoted. All these are phony ‘rights’ that have been fabricated through the corruption of our constitutional law and our understanding of it, and *no citizen of any race is entitled to them*.” \[italics added\]

The word “superior” never occurs in Francis’s article.

**Prof. Sussman: “The American Renaissance conferences, which began in 1994, have become a gathering place for white supremacists, white nationalists, white separatists, neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klan members, Holocaust deniers, and eugenicists.”**

Could Prof. Sussman provide names rather than name-calling?

**Prof. Sussman: “Arthur Jensen in an AR ‘conversation’ stated that the country’s attempt to build a multiracial nation ‘is doomed to failure.’ ”**

Arthur Jensen did not say that. I did.

**Prof. Sussman: “He \[Jensen\] also claimed that at least one-quarter of all blacks are “mentally retarded” and “not really educatable.”**

[Jensen said this](https://www.amren.com/news/2012/10/arthur-jensen-has-died/): “Once you get below IQs of 80 or 75, which is the cut-off for mental retardation in the California School System, children are put into special classes. These persons are not really educable up to a level for which there’s any economic demand. . . . People are shocked and disbelieving when you tell them that about one in four blacks in our population are in that category–below 75.”

**Prof. Sussman: “Glayde Whitney, as a contributing editor of AR, wrote a regular column in which he suggested that different races did not belong in the same species.”**

Prof. Whitney never wrote that. Citation, please.

**Prof. Sussman: “Lynn wrote in AR that environment has no effect on IQ scores and that differences between blacks and whites are entirely genetic.”**

Prof. Lynn never wrote that. He has always recognized an environmental effect on IQ.

**Prof. Sussman: “Levin also believed that whites would . . . once again discriminate against blacks in housing, employment, and schools. Taylor approved of Levin’s predictions and speculated that his inspired vision would lead to “policies strikingly similar to those of the pre-civil rights American South.”**

See [here](https://www.amren.com/archives/back-issues/october-1997/#cover) for what Levin and I actually wrote.

**Sussman: “At the 2000 AR conference, Taylor was greeted with a burst of applause when he speculated that whites may have lost so much ground in the last century because of Jews.”**

I have never said that, whether at the 2000 AR conference or at any other time. In answer to a question as to what had caused the “demoralization” of whites–not loss of  ground–I said that *others* have speculated to that effect. I also rejected Jewish influence as unsatisfactory, even as a partial explanation. A video of my 2000 conference speech is available [here](http://www.renaudvis.com/?product_tag=2000).

**Prof. Sussman writes that to argue that AR has the right to hold conferences is to “condone the ability or the right of hate groups to gather and incite racial and class hatred.”**

Prof. Sussman has never attended an AR conference. Readers can watch the lectures from the most recent conference online [here](https://www.amren.com/archives/conferences/twelfth-american-renaissance-conference-2014/) and decide for themselves whether AR is a “hate group” or incites “racial and class hatred.” Prof. Sussman is unique, to my knowledge, in claiming that AR takes any interest at all in class.

**Prof. Sussman: “Modern science now undermines all of their basic premises”**

Perhaps Prof. Sussman will provide a bibliography of studies that “undermine” the work of Arthur Jensen, Michael Levin, Linda Gottfredson, Tatu Vanhanen, Michael Woodley, Richard Lynn, John Baker, Nicholas Wade, Henry Harpending, Jan te Nijenhuis, Philippe Rushton, Robert Putnam, Walker Connor, and Frank Salter.

**Prof. Sussman dredges up a hasty and now disproven allegation that Jared Laughner, who shot Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords in 2011, had some tie to American Renaissance.**

All law enforcement agencies have conceded that there is [no evidence](http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0111/47438.html) for such a link.

**Prof. Sussman: “when a group publishes a journal and holds conferences preaching pro-Nazi, anti-Semitic, xenophobic, and racial hatred and glorifies such hatemongers as Adolf Hitler, Jesse Helms, and David Duke . . .”**

In the nearly 25 years that American Renaissance has been publishing and holding conferences, there is not one word that could be described as “pro-Nazi” or “anti-Semitic.” There is not a single word that glorifies Adolf Hitler, Jesse Helms or David Duke. Just a few minutes’ examination of our [website](https://www.amren.com/) and comprehensive [archives](https://www.amren.com/archives/) would make this clear to anyone. Even Mark Potok of the SPLC, which is an organization that never misses an opportunity to say something derogatory about me or AR, [has said](http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0111/47308.html), “Jared Taylor is not an anti-Semite.”

**Prof Sussman quotes, as follows, from the summary of a conference talk that appeared in AR: “\[Prof. Weissberg proposed\] ‘A Politically Viable Alternative to White Nationalism’ \[instead of proposing the complete elimination of nonwhites\].**

Professor Robert Weissberg did not propose an alternative to “the complete elimination of nonwhites” but to a “[movement explicitly based on white racial identity](https://www.amren.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=99089&amp;action=edit&amp;message=1).” What he actually said was apparently not wicked enough, so Prof. Sussman invented something else.

The title of Prof. Sussman’s book is *The Myth of Race*. He is clearly something of a myth-maker himself. If what he has written about me and American Renaissance is typical of his “scholarship,” nothing he has written in this book can be trusted. Harvard University Press–the university’s motto is “veritas”–should be embarrassed to have published it.

If I were to graduate in 4 years, there are chances that I wouldn't be able to finish my triple major (my other two majors don't really add anything to psych, they are both languages that I am passionate about, and they may benefit me if I decide to study language acquisition or some aspect of cognitive psych - I'm not sure yet as I also really enjoy clinical psych, but one thing I do know is that I love research), or if I would, I'd have to take 19+ credit hours for my last 3 semesters, as well as summer classes, and it just wouldn't be a very fun time. I also want to finish a Bachelor's Thesis and take more computer language courses, and though this is doable in 4 years, it would be very difficult and I wouldn't have time for a social life or a healthy mental/physical life. I even have enough credits to graduate right now as magna cum laude, but if I were to postpone my graduation I'd be able to finish closer to a 4.0 while having enough time to space out all the courses for my triple major, additional computer science courses, and maybe start learning a 5th language for fun? During this time, I'd also be able to acquire more years of research experience and just be able to have a better-balanced undergrad remainder, but I want to know if this would look bad for grad school and minimize my chances of being accepted? 

Also, I am almost 100% sure that I am taking a gap year to work and travel after undergrad - how does that look to grad school? I'm not planning on doing anything academically-enriching during this time, except maybe study for the GRE if I don't get the score I want during my senior year. Would it be better if I apply right after I graduate and (if accepted) defer, or apply after the gap year? 

Last thing: for people already in the psych PhD program, how do you guys like it? Would you recommend it? Also, any tips for potential students? 

Just wanted to make a note, that I will also be emailing an advisor or someone else that can give me more specific information, but I also wanted to see a student's perspective.

In my exams however i reached a score of 87 to 94, my parents were suprised that i had a good score (not like i have done it before) so they bought me the battlefield v game i already had 10 ps4 games but they knew i loved the battlefield series so they bought me it, my friend however has a score about 80 to 90 he was pretty smart too.

[**According to** ***The Crimson,***](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/11/4/fas-no-malicious-intent/) students in (allegedly) Lorgia García Peña’s SPANSH 126 “Performing Latinidad” class went out to put up an art exhibit in Harvard Yard on October 24.

Harvard Police showed up as the students were hanging paper cut-outs on a construction fence.

Shortly thereafter, several faculty sent a letter accusing the police of creating a “gratuitous atmosphere of intimidation and mistrust.” History professor Kirsten A. Weld sent her own letter noting the incident was “deeply upsetting to students and course staff” and “fully unnecessary.”

And it kept snowballing: The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Latinx Student Association [**created a petition**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeEqWMRtrhlHLOZ-lkhZiogaf-5X09hk0VdEYJQ4staq7dS4g/viewform) in which it called the encounter “one of several racist incidents in recent months.” It also made several demands.

“This incident requires us to think critically and respond to otherwise normalized racist, sexist, and classist acts against faculty and students of color,” the petition says. “Such acts enable the perpetuation of violence against marginalized members of our community.”

The demands included an “in-class apology” by Harvard administrators to the affected students, and “creation and execution of a training plan to address HUPD’s incompetence when dealing with biased reports on Harvard students and faculty of color.”

However, [**reality soon came crashing down**](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/11/4/fas-no-malicious-intent/):

&gt;The letter and petition alleged that a Harvard affiliate had decided to call HUPD after seeing several students of color prepare the class art installation outside Houghton.  
But the report rejects this allegation. A construction manager at Houghton who is unaffiliated with the University was the first person to note the students’ activity, according to the report. The construction manager called his Harvard-affiliated project managers — not HUPD, the report states. One of the project managers contacted Harvard Operations and Security who then contacted the Houghton Building Manager to report “a possible protest or demonstration.”  
The building manager then called HUPD without ever seeing the students, according to the report. Neither the race nor the ethnicity of the students were mentioned, per a transcript of the call included in the report.  
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an emailed statement that HUPD “routinely responds to these types of phone calls.”

The report does note the faculty member (allegedly García Peña) felt the students’ ethnicity played a role in the police being called. And, though there was no malicious or racist intent on the part of cops, the report points out the students “were upset” and “felt very hurtful.”

It adds that Harvard “standard operating procedures are not adequate” with regard to “innovative activities” like the art exhibit.

The letter demands the reparations due to the role Antigua and Barbudan slaves played in the creation of the Harvard Law School, because Antiguan plantation owner Isaac Royall donated money to create the first endowed law professor in 1815, *The Crimson* reported.

The Harvard Admissions Committee has only begun its evaluation of this year's candidates, and it is with sincere pleasure that I prematurely inform you we will not offer you a place in the class of 2024.

While your pitiful and cringe-worthy application did not merit to be dignified with even a superficial read, I realize that this decision may still come as a real disappointment. I hope it does. I also hope that you will understand the decision as a judgement of your own abilities, not a reflection of the extraordinary talent represented in our applicant pool. Of the more than forty thousand applications we received this year, your application stood out as so pitiful that it warranted an individualized and early rejection letter. It is painful to us that we must waste our time with imbeciles like yourself instead of devoting it to the so many superbly talented applicants.

We are tempted to ask what dosage of narcotics you were on when you chose to apply to Yale. While it is normally difficult for us to point to obvious weaknesses, enumerating your weaknesses would require a Google Doc. I was tempted to tease you with putting you on our waitlist, only to realize my brain could not handle reading your inevitable “letter of continued interest.” 

While I hope this decision serves as a warning to other talentless airheads like yourself, I want to thank you for your $80 application fee and for lowering our acceptance rate. Experience suggests that regardless of our decisions, most candidates like yourself will be welcomed by the sanitation department. 

Sincerely,

William R. Fitzsimmons

Dean of Undergraduate Admissions"

But this doesn’t mean we can’t donate a gate, we just have to smart about it! If we start saving now we can have enough for our own little tiny gate—think a doggy door. 

A doggy door gate is cheaper, makes the yard more accessible to dogs, and is just funny. 

For an added bonus we can tell tourist if their kid manages to crawls through the gate they get an increased chance of being admitted.

They seemed bored but I replied ""Well I was born a child prodigy, placed 1st in my state spelling bee for three consecutive years, I can speak eight different languages not counting Latin, play four different instruments, I skipped grades 4 through 6, and graduated my high school as valedictorian at the age of 14. I then worked as an intern at both Telsa, and NASA."" Suddenly the room burst into laughter and many of board instantly started scribbling down ""No"" near the application check marks. The Dean says ""Sorry but you are just not the type we are looking for."" But then I said ""Excuse me but I wasn't finished... I watch Rick and Morty"" The Dean looked at me like an idiot and said ""So....?"" Then I replied with a smile ""And I understand all the references and subtle jokes"" An audible gasp let out by the board was so loud the secretary had to come in. You could hear a pin drop and then suddenly all at once the entire board clicked their pens on the ""Approved Box"" and I was instantly handed a diploma and now I'm teaching advanced physicals there. I guess you can say I'm pretty smart. :)"

It's almost finished and we'd love to have some input from anyone interested in testing it out.

**You can read more about it here:** [avidnote.com](https://www.avidnote.com)

The main functionality includes:

**- ability to read and comment on a paper simultaneously** by having the document that you're reading on one side and your notes on the other. The user would be able to highlight text and write corresponding notes in the note taker and have these two be linked. This is meant to mimic the act of jotting down notes on a physical paper in the margins.

**- easily searchable and organized online.** This is one of the main drawbacks that I had with using physical paper to take notes, it's easy to misplace and you can't really search your notes.

**- quicker note taking with templates.** These templates include specifically formatted notes that you can create on the fly depending on the need, e.g. notes for research papers, lab notes, interview notes (for qualitative research) and so forth.

**- encrypted**, safe storage, LaTex, all that good stuff.

**- later version** (but not the first version) could include third party integration with Mendeley &amp; Zotero for references and Dropbox/Box for external storage. The initial app is expected to feature a simple backup function where you can download all of your notes. The user would be able to remove notes completely, since I know that is a requirement for certain researchers with sensitive data.

If you're interested, you can**[ sign up on the site](https://www.avidnote.com)** and if you have any feedback/requests or questions, I'd be glad to answer them here."

That hasn't changed. It's the end of sophomore fall and I'm still waiting for me to actually enjoy college and not feel so lonely and sad.

 It's so easy to make surface level friendships here but it's so hard for people to reciprocate. I've completely been distanced from my entire blocking group. They never tried to be friends with me or reach out and I got tired of doing all of the work. I feel like I have no community whatsoever. I don't have good friends with my house and there aren't other people I can just become closer to. And my grades will probably be mediocre, again. It makes it even more miserable for me to witness students at other schools like Yale have such perfect, happy lives where they're close with the people in their residential colleges and just are happy and do things. I literally do nothing here except for schoolwork and the occasional extracurricular meeting. At this point I'm starting to lose hope that I will ever find a genuine, close community or happiness here."

In one class, I got a 90.55, but my final grade is a B+. The professor revealed to us after grades were finalized that the grading scale he was using was 94+ for A, 92-93 for A-, 90-91 for B+, etc. with rounding and whatever. Nothing about the scale was even mentioned in the syllabus or in lecture, and I know because I didn't skip any lectures. I just wanted to know if grading scales like this are common at Harvard? I've almost never had a class with a different grading scale than the typical 90 is A-, 80 is B-, and so on in my undergrad or even high school, and the only time it was different it was in favor of the students. I don't have a problem with getting a B+, but several students in the class and I agree that it isn't fair to only reveal the scale you are using after the semester is over and grades are finalized.

For anyone wondering, the class was CS207 with Sondak."

I met someone while playing an online game named Starcraft who was boasting that he is a ""Harvard undergraduate.""

He tried to curse me out during the game because he felt his skills were superior to mine, but failed miserably, and tried so hard to establish his dominancy without avail. And that's when he pulled out his card as a ""Harvard undergrad"" in frustration.

What's funny is that his email address, [**hkshin@post.harvard.edu**](mailto:%22hkshin@post.harvard.edu) , which I've confirmed as the individual through our email correspondence, is not an undergraduate email address. In fact, if anyone with a high school diploma and some cash were to sign up for a Harvard Extension program and pay $3000 per course, he/she would receive this email once they finish the extension program. I confronted him about this, and he proceeded to attempting to change the subject and never discussed his degree again. But he did come back with some racial comments.

What's even funnier is that he was making fun of me for being an asian, by the usual comment ""Ching Chang Choong,"" but it turns out that his name is Henry Shin, having an asian name himself.

So, for anyone who plays Starcraft: Broodwar, you may meet a Henry Shin, if you play Starcraft, who likes to present himself as someone he is not, and likes to make racial comments in frustration against his own people. His name is Henry Shin, at the Harvard ""EXTENSION PROGRAM."""

I am a student from Southern California who will be moving (with a car) to Cambridge in August 2020 to start a masters program at Harvard. Disclaimer: I have read all posts I could find on this topic, but all of them seem to discourage car ownership by Harvard students as opposed to actual practical advice.

So with that said, could any fellow crazy car owners please share their thoughts or point me in the right direction? I am particularly interested in the following:

* What is the average cost for an off-street parking spot in Cambridge? Any recommended companies/landlords?
* If I am staying for 1 year, will I likely get busted for having out of state plates? According to the MA laws I read, there is no grace period to register your vehicle once you are an MA resident. That is in theory, how is it in practice?
* Is it easy to obtain a student parking permit? Are the garages fairly secure? How hard is it to find a space, typically?

Please do not try to talk me out of bringing my car. I am set on doing so (have very valid reasons) and am willing to pay for an off-street parking spot if it comes to that. Thanks in advance for any advice!"

I know this sub gets tons of posts just like these, and right now is probably prime time as we’re all reeling from the semester and getting back long-anticipated grades. I’ve spent tons of time brooding these thoughts, and hesitating to post because we’ve all heard this story before, but idk man, I really want these feelings off my chest. Either way I really am sorry in advance for the ranty long post ahead.

It’s 11:22 pm on the 31st and I’m unironically sitting in my bed in my dead quiet house while the rest of the world is celebrating New Years’ Eve. It’s not that I didn’t want to party. I just didn’t get invited anywhere. It’s given me even more time to ruminate than was already unhealthy, and now all the bad thoughts are just melting together and really letting me have it.
 
My first semester kind of sucked. I know it wasn’t the worst it possibly could have been, but it sure wasn’t good. Now I know this is pretty normal, but so many things that were bad about it are part of broader problems, and I know they won’t just magically resolve themselves. I feel really angry lately, which is just an intensification of previous, constant feelings of sadness, emptiness, paranoia and self-blame that have stretched back since early in high school. When I have memories about the semester, if I close my eyes and re-envision my state of mind when I had time to think— on those routine walks to/from the dhall, to class, wherever— with minimal exception, I could only ever recall feeling angry, sad, or just nothing. It was constant by around the second week of classes. Feeling nothing but either distinctly bad, or just nothing. Just flat. And that flat feeling wasn’t much better than bad, because it would devolve into feeling bad at the drop of a hat. The same didn’t go for good; something cool could happen, and I could feel relaxed for once, but the bad ruminations and mean inner criticisms would crowd out those feelings so quickly that I look back and hardly remember the good times even happened. It was like I had erectile dysfunction, but for happiness. By the end of the semester I felt like I was slowly losing my spirit. Just fading into something vaguer and vaguer every day. I felt like who I was there was just some even worse, even less likable version of whatever confused sad thing I was before.

My approach to these feelings this semester was mostly to isolate myself when I got into a really negative spiral, which ended up being pretty often after the first few weeks. I would avoid developing my friendships, not because I didn’t want to have friends, but because despite my efforts to cheer up, it was honestly really, really difficult to not appear cold and dismissive and terse in conversation even though none of that had a single thing to do with the other person. It’s not that I turned into an absolute asshat during those moods, or was explicitly mean, and it’s certainly not that I never talked to people. I really did have a some normal, good days, some great meals where I felt just fine and slipped back into my sort of funny, chill self. It’s just that I didn’t do it enough, and now I’m worried the withdrawn brooding side is all some people might remember. I could have done so much better. I just gave up and withdrew into myself too many times in the dhall or in classes or meetings with my EC. I could have done so much better. Not that I even know how to manage it, but I could have tried harder. I’m really concerned about the long-term effects of that behavior on my future ability to make friends here, because I’m paranoid that people have an image of me as this angry loner. Maybe kind of irrational, maybe not. I’m just angry at myself I let that side come out so often. We’re all people, we all get angry. You’re supposed to develop methods to control yourself. when you’re an adult. I’ve done a shit job with that. I shouldn’t have let it get this out of hand.

I’m really disgusted with myself. I feel like that’s the best way I could describe it sometimes. Like when I kind of step outside myself, and look inward, I kind of cringe, because ew, look at me. I’m not performing particularly well at school (and know a few of my peers did consistently better, plus were good wholesome people, so the ‘it’s only first semester’ stuff is not really a tenable excuse), I have no friends, my jokes aren’t really that funny, I’m kind of weird and tryhard and awkward. Any people I met in the dhall, at my main EC, that I SHOULD have pursued friendships with, I either only half did, or just didn’t, because I guess I couldn’t deal with the effort of following it up, or just couldn’t reign in my emotions. I’ve even gained fifteen pounds, so when I’m not degrading myself in my head for whatever reason, no worries, I could always just look at my body and be fucking disgusted all over again. I came home thinking maybe being away from Annenberg would help me at least begin shedding the weight, slowly, since we generally don’t keep excess food in the house . . . nope, no change. And too bad the iota of motivation I actually did have in the beginning of the semester, when I did get myself to the gym a few times, has totally burnt out.

I know we all have a mean inner critical voice and this is it talking. But the thing is, I feel like when we tend to say things like ‘don’t listen to the critical inner voice, because it’s irrational,’ my problem with that is that I feel like mine is, actually, pretty ‘rational’. I really do seem to deserve some, if not most, of the self-criticism. My personality is lacking somewhere. Not to make this about logic of anything, but it’s the inference to the best explanation. Take the real-life evidence, I don’t have friends. I’m not getting hit up. Never dated anyone. I’m a lonely person. I am capable of being outgoing and somewhat funny, but somewhere along the way the motor just burns out and somehow I can’t make and keep friends. I’m not extremely desirable friend or partner material, and I am doing this to myself, and am not getting better at not doing that to myself. 

I know it it can change. Anything can change. It could get better, sure. Then it could get worse again. I told myself that things would change for the better in high school, and senior year — forget it, after Dec. 13th I thought I was holding that golden ticket, finally on my way to feeling ‘normal’ and fulfilled and with my own crowd. I remember the fever of the holidays. I binged the housing day videos when they came out, memorized all the flags and mascots. I watched that Adams rap video one in awe, feeling all fuzzy, like I was in on this special inside joke now. Well, reversal of fate, now who even knows if I’ll have a blocking group. I’ll have less than a month to figure it out. I just wish I gave it a little more effort. I couldn’t just suck it up and get back on the horse. That’s what life is about, getting back on the horse. And I couldn’t do it, and I don't know how to get better at doing it.

If anyone else had similar feelings first semester and wants to share any insight, I would really appreciate it. I'm currently talking to someone at CAMHS, and having some sort of evaluation soon where I guess they determine whether I should get on meds. That's kind of worrisome in its own right because my parents' divorce is leaving my mom in a really awful financial situation, and getting outside treatment is costly and I don't even want to think about stressing her out more, but we'll see. If anyone found other ways of coping that helped in the first year, it would mean a lot. 

I’m sorry this was a dump. If it’s too rambling, I’m sorry, delete it, or I will. I know it’s like anything else we all see and hear about here, but I seriously have nowhere else to put down these feelings. I hope everyone on this sub has a great New Years. You all work so hard and deserve the best. Whoever you are, I seriously hope you could find some solace from whatever you’re going through right now. I’m sure we could all use that right now.

Is there anything in particular that you would recommend working on over the course of 4 years which could separate me from the rest of intelligent people I will be put up against when applying? As of sports, I’m not on any of the school teams, but I do plenty of extracurriculars such as recreational basketball, Robotics, FBLA, volunteering, Tech Crew, and Science Bowl that I will be continuing (for) over 4 years. I also love to play intramural sports as well as video games in my free time. I’m interested in math, however I don’t have the strongest grades in it because I have received a very harsh grading teacher compared to others in my grade.

Starting next semester I will be taking all AP classes and my senior year I will also be taking all AP classes. I'm in the school band (I play the Saxophone), I recently became part of the LGBTQ community, and volunteer at a dog shelter and work part time at a curling sheet.

1. What else should I do to separate myself from my peers?
2. How inclusive is the Harvard community?
3. Will deciding to be gay help my application process?

I don’t want to be rude or call anyone out, but I’m afraid of Harvard’s social sphere. A fair share of posts in this subreddit are about how lonely and sad Harvard students feel, the lack of a dating life, and so on. This just kinda worries me a bit. I kinda hoped getting into Harvard was like this golden ticket and life would be all butterflies and rainbows after I started college. Obviously, this was super naive, but now it seems like it might even be the opposite. I already struggle with sadness and loneliness right now and I’d hate for college to amplify them. 

I’m already somewhat introverted. In high school, I finally made some solid friends, but it took until senior year for me to find them.  I’m afraid that finding friends at Harvard might take too long. I wish I thought of this earlier because by now it’s too late to apply to other schools, specifically MIT. MIT seems like it might be a better fit for me (I want to study comp sci and am pretty nerdy in liking engineering), but the all-nighter horror stories and my annoying mit tour guide scared me away from applying, which I now sincerely regret. MIT seems to have a ton of sciencey, nerdy people that I get along well with. So far all the Harvard people I met are super into social justice, liberal arts, and debating, which is fine and cool, but not really the kind of people I associate with.

Also, a minor point about the people, everyone seems to be way more accomplished than me by just looking at their Instagram pages. Imposter syndrome is already coming in hot :(

Finally, sports are a minor issue I have about Harvard. I was hoping to play my sport at Harvard, but even if I could play, the D1 level of athletics seems very hard core and I don’t know if I could handle it, if even afforded the opportunity. I am aware of club options, but I don’t know much about it. 

I should also state that I am still almost certainly coming to Harvard. I didn’t really apply to any school that I would choose over Harvard. I really just want to know how I can make sure the social life goes well for me. I realize that it might be early to start worrying about this since I haven’t even been at Harvard for one day, but I’d rather be prepared for the worst. Thanks

TLDR: I am going to Harvard in the fall, but I’m afraid that a sciencey introvert like me will have trouble making friends, dating, and not getting depressed. It might be early to worry about this, but I’d like to know about all I can in advance. Any advice on how to avoid that would be super appreciated."

Hi. I am a senior in m final year of high school and I am currently working on a mandatory research-based project that is needed to pass my physics class. The topic I chose (Harmonic Motion and fluid damping) seemed simple at the beginning, but now I am stuck and too far into the process to be able to change my research question or area. I found a Harvard document online that indicates that there is a physics lab at Harvard that is somewhat similar to my experiment. I need to get in touch with anybody that takes Physics at Harvard and may have done this experiment. PLEASE

eoe0uq,Harvard Crimson,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/eoe0uq/harvard_crimson/,MongolianBotanist,1,2020-01-13 17:31:49,4,/r/Harvard/comments/eoe0uq/harvard_crimson/,NaN,"Last semester was overall a really good one for me. I met so many great people, and I am grateful I was able to so quickly find a niche at the big bustling nerve-wracking world of Harvard.

A big part of that was thanks to the Harvard Crimson, which was far more welcoming and accepting than I could have hoped for. It's truly such a great organization. Its comp process was long and challenging, but my comp directors made the experience completely manageable, light-hearted, and fun. We got to publish multiple articles and benefitted from the experience and expertise of thoughtful, wise editors.

So the Crimson-ICE controversy absolutely broke my heart. On multiple occasions, it brought me to tears. I am a sensitive person, and I try my best to be a moral person. I'm quite left-wing, and strongly support abolish ICE, the decriminalization of immigration, and taking in as many refugees as possible. 

And yet I can't escape a simple, clear conviction I have come to: The Crimson was in the right, Act on a Dream in the wrong. 

Act on a Dream was absolutely unreasonable in their demands and thoughtless in their actions. The main purpose of a public protest is to demonstrate public support for a cause. The free press has an obligation to scrutinize and duly report on protests, which benefits just social movements by spreading their message and reach. Reaching out to a government agency for comment is never an endorsement of said agencies' actions, nor does it inherently put students in danger. If ICE wanted to prey on undocumented students at Harvard, they would do so regardless of if a comment is asked. ICE's non-comment on the article is demonstrative of their uncaring attitudes to the lives of this country's many brilliant and brave undocumented students. Therefore, the Crimson, without resorting to biased reporting, was able to demonstrate the strength and moral conviction of the Abolish ICE movement in Harvard's community.

Then, Act on a Dream threw that all away by attacking the Crimson for conducting a routine component of journalism. The boycott by various Harvard student groups only did three things: ensure that their efforts and movements would not be reported on with their voice accounted for, cause people both in and outside of the Harvard community to think less of these vital causes, and spread misinformation about the actions and the nature of the Crimson as an organization. I've talked to many students, all otherwise smart and lovely people, who had completely warped views of the situation. Some thought the Crimson literally gave ICE the names of undocumented students, or that we collaborated with them to undermine the protest. I heard people talking about vandalizing the Crimson's headquarters. When people don't trust the Crimson, they will have trouble gaining a full, nuanced perspective on complex campus issues. 

Student activists have wasted so much time and effort attacking their fellow students, and allies in making Harvard a fair and just community. It makes me so upset the wasted potential this stupid and unnecessary complicit created. 

I want us all to move on

So, as an anonymous internet person, I hope that we all can find peace and cooperation in the next semester. I hereby give full, unconditional forgiveness to the people who have slandered my peers, and caused the national press to ridicule the Harvard activist community. I love you all, and I know most of you are good people.

If you want to make a difference on campus, one of the best ways is to comp the Crimson this coming semester. We have a generous financial aid program and do not cut anyone during the comp. All are welcome. Love and mercy everyone."

Thirty-one percent of Harvard’s tenure-track professors lost their tenure bids in the 2018‒19 academic year without alleging bias, since most of those failed contenders were white. Yet García Peña has gone through her academic career playing the victim, reflexively accusing those around her of white supremacy. In this, she is a perfect synecdoche for ethnic studies itself, which also stakes its identity on the conceit that it is in a nonstop battle for survival against the forces of racism and exclusion.  
&gt;  
&gt;To the contrary, ethnic studies is ascendant. It is spreading rapidly throughout K‒12 schools; its ideology has already bled into the political realm. It’s worth reviewing García Peña’s career as an emblem of a fast-rising academic field whose worldview is taking over American culture."

My current interest is in international affairs, and as of now I envision my career path as something in that field, whether it be working for the government or a think tank/NGO or something like that. 

Going in, I have a relatively firm belief that my primary concentration will be Government, but I’m undecided on whether or not I want my secondary field to be in East Asian Studies or German.  I feel somewhat compelled to worry about this now because I saw that I would have to be fluent in either language (Mandarin or German) in order to take advantage of study abroad in those areas, as well as taking advantage of internships/work abroad, so I’ll have to learn the language prior to junior year I think. If this is wrong, or if this is something y’all think my academic advisor or someone like that can help me with in time, please let me know. 

My justification for studying German is that I have a deep love of German culture and history, and the idea of studying abroad in any German speaking country appeals to me. Also, if at some point in my career I have to work abroad, I’d rather be living in Germany/Austria/Switzerland/some German speaking country rather than China. Also, Germany being arguably the most important country in Europe, I think it will have use. 

My justification for studying Mandarin is that I find Sino-American relations extremely interesting from the policy perspective, and I think that it’ll become the most important country America has relations with, so studying Mandarin will bear the most fruit. My current conception is that living in China if I must would not be that nice (at least compared to German-speaking nations), but please tell me if that conception is wrong. 

I’m kinda torn, so guidance would be appreciated. 

I realize this isn’t the optimal subreddit to ask, but I wouldn’t know where else I should ask. If y’all know a better one, please direct me there.

I feel as though I’ve tried everything. The clubs I joined don’t meet regularly so I don’t really see the people afterwards. In the beginning I tried to be more social but to no avail.  I know people say you don’t really stick with freshman friends but everyone I’ve met so far seems pretty close to the people they’ve met. Sophomore housing is coming soon and I don’t know what I will do because I won’t have any roommates. How can I find a friend group now? Blocking at Harvard makes it near impossible to form newer friend groups after freshman spring so I don’t want to wait until then. I’m tired of being alone and not having anyone to turn when I get upset but I don’t know what I can do to change it.

Wake up sheeple, Wuhan is the site of the Corona Virus outbreak, and it just so happens some Chinese researcher at Harvard snuck it back into China? 

Here's what really happened, Harvard knows it will lose the SFFA lawsuit on appeal and instead of hiring Alan Dershowitz to represent them in court they go back to the good ol' days when Harvard's faculty was filled with eugenicists and decide to create a deadly virus to lower the population of possible asian applicants.

美国中央情报局犯有对中国进行生物攻击并在武汉传播该病毒的罪行

冠状病毒（2019-nCoV）是一场生物战，旨在使美中经济脱钩，这是美国在战斗中进攻中国的序幕

The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was designed by the United States and planted in Wuhan, China by the American CIA to serve as a biological weapon meant to decouple the US-China economies; and to separate, segregate, and to isolate China from the rest of the world including closing of borders, severing supply chains and rerouting trade to bypass China with the purpose of weakening China from within and causing internal strife and sowing chaos and discord and also as a prelude to a US initiated fighting war against China in the South China Sea. The ultimate purpose is to protect and restore American hegemony (including protecting the US petrodollar hegemony against the rising Huawei-enabled Chinese blockchain-based digital Yuan and China's Belt and Road infrastructure and trade initiatives in Eurasia) and to collapse the Chinese government, to cut off China from global trade and international commerce and to force a regime change of China's government after defeating China in a devastating physical war.

2019年的新型冠状病毒（2019-nCoV）由美国设计，由美国中央情报局（CIA）种植在中国武汉，作为一种生物武器，旨在使中美经济脱钩;并将中国与世界其他地区分离，隔离和隔离，包括关闭边界，切断供应链和重新安排贸易以绕过中国，目的是削弱中国的内部和造成内部冲突，造成混乱和不和，以及这是美国在南中国海发起针对中国的战争的序幕。最终目的是保护和恢复美国的霸权（包括保护美国的石油美元霸权免受日益增多的基于华为的基于中国的基于区块链的数字元以及中国在欧亚大陆的“一带一路”基础设施和贸易计划），并瓦解中国政府，削减在一场毁灭性的自然战争中击败中国后，迫使中国脱离全球贸易和国际贸易，并迫使中国改变政权。

I believe and have compelling circumstantial reason to believe that the American CIA injected and planted the so-called ""Wuhan virus"" into Wuhan, China in or around the dates of October 31st 2019 to December 31st 2019 with intent to harm China, and the Chinese people, and with potential to destabilize and perhaps even with the motive to collapse China from within.

我相信并且有令人信服的间接理由认为，美国中央情报局于2019年10月31日至2019年12月31日前后在中国武汉注入并植入了所谓的“武汉病毒”，意图伤害中国， 人民，有破坏稳定的潜力，甚至有动摇中国内部力量的动机。

Is war between China and the US inevitable? | Graham Allison

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XewnyUJgyA4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XewnyUJgyA4)

The US wants to re-route global supply chain around China, to bypass China and isolate China on the world stage versus the China wanting to use Huawei-enabled digital-blockchain Yuan, and cashless WeChat, etc to topple the US Petrodollar hegemony and also to use the Chinese the ( One Belt One Road ) BRI / OBOR relationships and bi-lateral trade/infrastructure agreements in order to propel the world to adopt the use of the digital Yuan, and in order to have the world bypass the SWIFT system (since US has abused its dollar status and weaponized it for unlawful sanctions) and to bypass the US dollar as the default global reserve currency etc. It was a race against time to see whom would pull the rug from underneath the other countries feet first. US, unable to compete fairly due to its structural disadvantages and many other shortcomings, decided to go the biological attack route, which allows it to hide under the cover of ""plausible deniability"" (since it is more difficult to conclusively prove the attribution or source of a new mysterious virus than it would be to track the trajectory of an incoming thermonuclear missile etc) to inflict maximum damage to China while minimizing the potential blowback.

美国想在中国重新布局全球供应链，绕开中国并在世界舞台上孤立中国，而中国则想使用支持华为的数字区块链元，无现金微信等推翻美国石油美元霸权，以及利用中国的“一带一路” BRI /一带一路关系和双边贸易/基础设施协议，以推动世界采用数字元，并让世界绕过SWIFT系统（由于美国滥用其美元地位并将其武器用作非法制裁），并绕过美元作为默认的全球储备货币等。这是一场与时俱进的竞赛，看谁先将地毯从其他国家的脚下拉开。美国由于其结构上的劣势和许多其他缺陷而无法公平竞争，因此决定采取生物攻击路线，这使其可以躲藏在“合理的可否认性”的掩盖下（因为要更确切地证明归因或来源很难而不是追踪传入的热核导弹等的轨迹，从而对中国造成最大的损害，同时最大程度地减少潜在的反冲。

Right after the signing of the so-called ""Trade Deal"" in which the US didn't get what it wanted (the US did not get the sort of Plaza Accord concessions that it was hoping to get out of President Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and thought that China would kowtow to the US etc) and immediately into the start of the new decade (marking the turn of the second decade in what the PNAC would called the ""New American Century"" in which it proposed using genetic viral targeting to accomplish political motives) the US resorted to biological attacks in order to contain, isolate and attempt to cripple China/CCP internally and on the world stage at large. After its NED/CIA sponsored Hong Kong destablization/radicialization didn't spill over into the rest of mainland China, and right after its intense year long anti-China anti-Huawei campaigns have peaked in effectiveness, the US releases the evil demon virus into the heart of mainland China, at the absolutely worst possible location (Wuhan being one of the Chinese main Central hubs in terms of transportation and an important city for China's Belt and Road initiatives and estimated to have as high as 8% growth in GDP in 2020) and in also the absolute worst possible timing (right before the Chinese Lunar New year, otherwise known as the greatest annual human migration event, during a time in which shopping, spending and consumerisms activity would have been at a peak etc) in order to cripple China economically, to cut China off from the rest of the world and even force China to isolate its own cities from within, and to have the effect of smearing China's reputation on the world stage and invoking the escalation of fear, racisms and bigotry towards the Chinese people abroad.

就在所谓的“贸易协定”签署之后，美国没有得到想要的东西（美国没有得到希望摆脱习近平主席和中国人的那种《广场协议》让步。共产党（CCP）认为中国会ko头向美国等），并立即进入新的十年的开始（标志着PNAC称其为“新美国世纪”的第二个十年的转变），为了实现政治目的而将基因病毒作为目标），美国诉诸生物攻击，以遏制，隔离并试图在内部乃至整个世界范围内削弱中国/ CCP。在其NED / CIA赞助的香港的灭绝/辐射化并未蔓延到中国大陆的其他地区之后，并且经过长达一年的激烈反华反华运动已经达到效果的最高峰之后，美国才将恶魔病毒释放到位于中国大陆的心脏地带，地理位置绝对最糟糕（武汉是中国交通运输的主要中央枢纽之一，也是中国\`\`一带一路''倡议的重要城市，预计到2020年GDP增​​长高达8％ ）以及绝对最糟糕的时间（正值农历新年之前，也就是人们已知的最大的年度人类迁徙事件，当时购物，消费和消费主义活动将达到顶峰等），以便在经济上削弱中国，使中国与世界其他地区隔绝，甚至迫使中国将自己的城市与内部隔离，并在世界舞台上抹黑中国的声誉。 d对海外华人的恐惧，种族主义和偏执狂升级。

All this comes right on top of the heels of the event last fall, African swine fever (ASF), which had never before seen in China but now mysteriously appeared with the onset of the US trade war, decimated half of China's pigs, which doubled pork prices and contributed to inflation causing pricy US pork exports to double in China. The odds for two such consequent anomalies, timing and location are exceedingly low. Yet both did occur – in almost perfect sequence. Particularly devastating is the very real possibility that this virus was intentionally engineered to have as long an incubation period as possible, and with the ability to hide within plain site, by being asymptomatic during its initial stages hence making it orders of magnitude more difficult to eradicate. Just recently, as recent as Feb 1st 2020, there has been yet a third mysterious outbreak in China, this time of the bird flu kind that is far more deadly to humans and wiping out Chinese chicken and poultry at the most dire of times. Indeed the coronavirus victims so far, both inside and outside of China, are only people with Chinese type of blood, Haplogroup O-M175, designed to attack that type of blood and specifically Chinese people.

所有这些都恰好发生在去年秋天的事件之后，非洲猪瘟（ASF）在中国从未见过，但随着美国贸易战的爆发而神秘地出现了，它使一半的中国猪灭绝了，翻了一番。猪肉价格上涨和通货膨胀加剧，导致价格昂贵的美国猪肉出口在中国增长了一倍。两次这样的异常，时机和位置的可能性极低。然而，两者的确发生了-几乎是完美的顺序。特别具有破坏性的是，这种病毒实际上是经过精心设计的，具有尽可能长的潜伏期，并具有在原始位点隐藏的能力，因为在其初始阶段没有症状，因此使其更难以根除。就在最近，直到2020年2月1日，中国仍发生了第三次神秘暴发，这次禽流感对人类的致命性要大得多，并在最可怕的时期消灭中国的鸡肉和家禽。的确，到目前为止，在中国境内和境外，冠状病毒的受害者都是仅有中国血统的人Haplogroup O-M175，旨在攻击这种血统的人，尤其是中国人。

Dr. Steven Hatfill Biological Weapons Expert says the Wuhan virus it will have to play it out and ""run its course"" not only in Wuhan but the greater mainland China. The host of ""War Room: Pandemic"" Mr. Steve Bannon (Trump's chief campaign advisor and trusted sidekick) predicted this will crush China economically, and that its the end of the XI/BRI/OBOR and will give US the chance to re-route trade of all countries to go-around and bypass China bringing the global supply chain back to US and its allies whilst isolating China economically, politically, etc. They are selling this to the American people and pitching it to the world as this evil Chinese Belt and Road connectivity is what is allowing this virus to spread so fastly to the rest of the world and that it would behoove mankind and all nations to reconsider the security and stability of their own supply chains and basically urging everyone to pull their companies, people, trade, businesses etc out of China. This is not unlike what Wilber Ross US Commerce Secretary already stated a few days ago... that this virus is good for America and will help bring lots of jobs back to the USA... seems like the goal is to use this event to pull the rug underneath China's development feets.

史蒂芬·哈特菲尔（Steven Hatfill）生物武器专家说，武汉病毒不仅要在武汉而且要在更大的中国内地发挥作用，并且要“顺其自然”。 “战争室：大流行”的主持人史蒂夫·班农先生（特朗普的首席竞选顾问兼可信赖的搭档）预测说，这将在经济上压垮中国，而且习近平/一带一路/一带一路的终结将使美国有机会重新引导所有国家进行贸易绕行并绕过中国，从而将全球供应链带回美国及其盟国，同时在经济，政治等方面隔离中国。道路连通性使这种病毒得以如此迅速地传播到世界其他地方，人类和所有国家都应该重新考虑其自身供应链的安全性和稳定性，并从根本上敦促每个人都撤离其公司，人员，贸易，企业等。这与几天前美国商务大臣威尔伯·罗斯（Wilber Ross）所说的没有什么不同……该病毒对美国有益，将有助于将大量工作带回美国……似乎目标是利用这一事件来把地毯拉到中国发展的脚下。

I suppose it could be a coincidence that China, the geopolitical adversary and economic enemy to the United States (according to the US itself), suddenly gets this mysterious virus seemingly far more potent than SARS (which itself apparently only targeted Chinese ethnic DNA and left the white/Caucasian population untouched) at the worst possible timing and in the worst possible location. Wuhan being Chinese's central hub and this being the Chinese Lunar New Year, it has the highest ability to spread and go ""super viral"" whilst impacting the max amount of damage to the stability of the China, both in terms of having the max potential to cause political turmoil in the homeland (ruining people's new year, quarantine and lockdowns of cities of unprecedented proportion, causing many Chinese citizens to get angry etc) and doing the maximum amount of possible damage to the Chinese economy, ruining the New Year in which consumerisms was supposed to be at its very highest points.

我想这可能是一个巧合，中国是美国的地缘政治对手和经济敌人（根据美国本身），突然发现这种神秘病毒似乎比SARS（其自身显然只针对中国人的DNA，而实际上离开了 白人/高加索人口未触及），在最糟糕的时机和最糟糕的位置进行。 武汉是中国的中心枢纽，也是中国的农历新年，它具有最大的传播和传播“超级病毒”的能力，同时对中国稳定的最大损害也具有最大的潜力。 在祖国造成政治动荡（破坏人们的新年，隔离和封锁前所未有的城市，使许多中国公民生气等），对中国经济造成最大可能的破坏，破坏了消费主义的新年 本应处于最高点。

Even the SARS of 2003 had a negative impact on Chinese GDP by as much as 2%, and this new novel virus has already turned out to be far worse than SARS and at a much more accelerated speed of spread and deaths. Unsurprisingly, without need for a single bullet fired or sanction imposed, it already managed to force China to self-impose the closure of its borders and cities, most nations have already stopped flights to China including the United States itself, on the world stage it is another ""ding"" for China's image and gives the propaganda mouthpieces of the West something else to gripe about, whilst at the same time an attempt to cap Chinese One Belt One Road ambitions and sabotage China's growing economy and hegemonic rise. It comes right on the crisp of Trump signing the fake ""Trade Deal"" and the UK decided to go against the US and work with Huawei.... I say something else is going on behind the scenes, more than what we are being told. We could have transition from Trade War, to Tech War to now maybe bio-war, if that is the case, then very likely the US already fired the first, second, and third shots, so to speak.

即使是2003年的SARS，其对中国GDP的负面影响也高达2％，而且这种新的新型病毒已经证明比SARS严重得多，并且传播和死亡的速度大大加快。毫不意外的是，它无需强制执行任何子弹射击或制裁，就已成功迫使中国自行实行其边界和城市的封锁，在世界舞台上，大多数国家已经停止飞往包括中国在内的飞往中国的航班。这是中国形象的另一个“叮叮当当”，它给西方的宣传喉舌带来了其他令人难以忘怀的东西，同时试图限制中国“一带一路”的野心，破坏了中国经济的增长和霸权的崛起。恰好在特朗普签署虚假的“贸易协议”的明朗声明上，英国决定与美国对立并与华为合作。... 。我们可以从贸易战过渡到技术战，再到现在的生物战，如果是这样的话，那么美国可以说已经发射了第一枪，第二枪和第三枪。

China should at least stay very vigilant and have a credible deterrence contingency plan in place... In the nuclear world in which China has DF-41, the ""MAD"" (Mutual Assured Destruction) doctrine is still well in place. But a mystery virus affords far more ""plausible deniability"" for the US. Thus achieving the goal with less fear of attribution and thus retribution. Instead of directly confronting China in the South China Sea militaristically immediately, maybe they think a better way to take China down a notch or two would be the use of ""other means"" to an ends... Science and technology in the world has come a long way since the days of Westerners giving Native Americans blankets laced with smallpox to ""thanksgiving"" them. It is the human condition to be risk/loss adverse. A nation that would stop at nothing to achieve Manifest Destiny on the way up surely wouldn't have any qualms of preserving its hegemony at all costs on the way down. After all, the American way of life is nonnegotiable and Graham T. Allison predicted the likelihood that this confrontation of a rising power with a declining power will inevitably lead to war, and history has shown that to be indeed the case. The US is applying its doctrine of maximum pressure to destroy China on all fronts, with Trade War, Tech and supply chain War, cyberwar, information and psychological operations warfare, and now biological warfare and most likely to be followed up with conventional or even nuclear war once US believes China is sufficiently weakened.

中国至少应该保持高度警惕，并制定可靠的威慑应急计划……在拥有DF-41的核世界中，“ MAD”（互助保证销毁）学说仍然存在。但是神秘病毒为美国提供了更多的“合理的可否认性”。从而在实现目标的同时，减少了对归因和报应的恐惧。他们可能不是认为立即在军事上与南中国海直接对抗，而是使中国跌倒一两个等级的更好方法是利用“其他手段”达到目的……世界科学技术已经来临自从西方人给美洲原住民毯子盖上天花以“感恩”它们以来，已有很长的路要走。风险/损失不利是人类的处境。一个不会为实现清单上的目标而竭尽全力的国家肯定不会在下降的路上不惜一切代价保持霸权。毕竟，美国人的生活方式是不可谈判的，格雷厄姆·T·艾里森（Graham T. Allison）预测，崛起的力量与衰落的力量的这种对抗将不可避免地导致战争的可能性，历史证明事实确实如此。美国正在运用其最大压力的理论来全面摧毁中国，包括贸易战，技术和供应链战，网络战，信息和心理行动战，以及现在的生物战，最有可能是常规战争，甚至是核战争。一旦美国认为中国已被充分削弱，战争就会爆发。

In terms of the bigger picture from the high-level top-down geopolitical standpoint, (all else being equal) America knows that ""time is on China's side"" be it with regards to GDP PPP, or the situation in the South China Sea, or that of Hong Kong, and later Taiwan, and especially as China's sphere of influence continues to grow in Eurasia; or even in the larger context of the digital blockchain Yuan and China's BRI/OBOR to replace or supplant the US petrodollar hegemony and so many other aspects... America knows that if status quo doesn't abruptly change that one day it will be too late to confront China. Trump, as their self-proclaimed ""Chosen One"" has openly stated from the beginning that he won't allow China to surpass America ""on his watch"" and that if his administration doesn't stop China right now that no future generation of administrations will ever be able to do so again. The US recognizes that the situation is quickly reaching an inflection point past which there is no point of return or going back. It is now or never. And since a direct nuclear confrontation is not going to help America achieve its goals or retaining its status, nor reversing its decline, and coming back on top in terms of once again being sole unipolar hyperpower with no contender or meaningful challenger, then only option left after a failed trade war and failed tech war was to attack China in the back by secretly using biological warfare against China, not once, not twice, but now for a third and potentially ever more devastating time as each attack is increased in boldness and exponential in unprovoked escalation.

从高级别的自上而下的地缘政治观点看，美国知道GDP PPP，南中国海或香港局势的“时机在中国一边”，之后是台湾，尤其是随着中国在欧亚大陆的势力范围不断扩大；甚至在数字区块链的更大背景下，人民币和中国的BRI / OBOR取代或取代了美国石油美元霸权等诸多方面……美国知道，如果现状不会突然改变，那么这一天也将如此迟到与中国对抗。特朗普自称“选民”，从一开始就公开表示，他将不允许中国“当心”超越美国，而且如果他的政府现在不停止中国，就没有下一代政府将永远能够再次这样做。美国认识到，局势正在迅速达到拐点，超过此拐点就没有返回或回头的迹象。现在或永远不会。而且由于直接的核对抗不会帮助美国实现其目标或保持其地位，也不会扭转其衰落，并且在再次成为唯一的单极超级大国而又没有竞争者或有意义的挑战者的情况下重回榜首，因此只剩下选择在一场失败的贸易战和一次失败的技术战之后，是通过暗中对中国进行生物战来反击中国，而不是一次，不是两次，但现在是三分之一，甚至是毁灭性的时间，因为每次攻击的勇气和指数都在增加毫无根据地升级。

From the American side the narrative has already been spun that “due to the busy new year China must have accidentally leaked their own virus” and certainly there are motived elements in Western media being compelled to push this particular narrative out in the open at the moment. But it is reasonable to question the motive for spinning something fictional like this, why suddenly now the conspiracy theory from Western powers that China did this tragedy to itself by carelessly releasing a lab made virus that it supposedly had been working on in Wuhan? Who stands to gain the most from this event and the narrative being spun around the event? Also, even playing devil's advocate and assuming the Western assumption may have some element of possibility in that a virus in the Wuhan lab was accidentally released to China own detriment, a reasonable person may also wonder about the timing, in that China’s supposedly first known incident of accidental release of virus causing harm of any magnitude just so happens to be right around signing of historic trade deal and right before the lunar new year mass migration, hence they attack the element of timing by preemptively suggesting that due to the new year rush it must have made operations that much more error prone etc.

从美国方面来说，已经有这样的说法：“由于忙碌的新年，中国肯定不小心泄露了自己的病毒”，并且西方媒体肯定有动机将这些特定的说法公开发布。 。但是有理由质疑这种虚构的事情的动机，为什么现在突然之间西方国家的阴谋论认为中国是通过不小心释放它原本应该在武汉从事的实验室制造的病毒而自己悲剧的呢？谁能从这一事件中获得最大利益，以及围绕该事件进行的叙事？同样，即使扮演恶魔的拥护者并假设西方的假设也可能具有某种可能性，即武汉实验室中的病毒被意外地释放给了中国，这是一个合理的人也可能会怀疑时机，因为这是中国所谓的第一个已知事件偶然释放病毒而造成任何程度的危害的原因恰好是在签署历史性贸易协定前后以及正好在农历新年大规模迁移之前，因此，他们通过抢先暗示由于新年匆忙而暗示了时间因素。一定会使操作更容易出错等。

What's more likely, the Chinese government accidentally released their own virus that was designed to somehow only target their own peoples Chinese DNA and it (the accidental release of the virus) just so happened to coincide with the absolute worst timing for China; (both in terms of the peak of the US China trade war and right before the Lunar new year mass migration) or some hostile superpower took advantage of this for plausible deniability and then deflects suspicion away from them by spinning up this nonsense story? Who stands to win the most from this event and who stands to lose the most? What does common sense tell you? Which nation in the very same first month of 2020 went against international law to trick and ambush a top Iranian general and assassinated him in a drone strike in a cowardly manner whilst pretending to operate under the guise and pretext of 'rule of law' and with the Iranian general being ostensibly invited for ""peace talks""?

更有可能的是，中国政府意外地发布了自己的病毒，该病毒旨在以某种方式只针对本国人民的中国DNA，而它（偶然释放的病毒）恰好与中国绝对最糟糕的时机相吻合。 （无论是在美中贸易战的高峰期，还是在农历新年大规模移民之前），还是一些敌对的超级大国都利用这一优势进行了合理的可否认性，然后通过散布这个无稽之谈来转移对他们的怀疑？ 谁在这次比赛中获胜最多，谁在损失最大？ 常识告诉你什么？ 哪个国家在2020年第一个月的同一天违反了国际法，以欺骗和伏击伊朗的一名高级将领，并以ward弱的方式用无人驾驶飞机暗杀了他，却假装以“法治”的幌子和借口行事。 表面上邀请伊朗将军参加“和平谈判”吗？

The whole idea is to provoke China into responding and in the process having China make the mistake of giving the US the excuse needed to further exponentially escalate. America knows China prefers non-confrontation as the Chinese strategy is simply to build, to trade, to bid time and to focus on its own development and economic growth instead of worrying about confronting US directly. Every nation simply does what’s in their own best interest, maximizing optimization strategies conducive to bettering its advantages. For the US it means taking an early and provocative challenge direct to China in the form of trade war, tariffs, tech bans, coercing allies to switch supply chains, kidnapping Huawei CFO, and surgical bioweapons tailored to Chinese DNA and deployed at the timing and location of max impact. This biological attack differs from conventional warfare in that it would allow the initiator of aggression, in this instance the United States of America, to preserve the option at its choosing to take a more equivocal stance and fluid position by inflicting harm onto China but without a publicly overt display of open hostilities. This virus was engineered to have maximum devastation in high density Asian environments, and it is an asymmetric weapon because these conditions are not reproducible anywhere else in the world other than in mainland China, the factory of the global world with over 1.4 billion citizens living in high density supermegacities with the required critical threshold to cause an uncontrolled chain reaction in infection spread rate.

整个想法是挑衅中国做出回应，并在此过程中让中国犯下了给美国提供进一步成倍增长的借口的错误。美国知道中国更喜欢无对抗，因为中国的战略只是建立，贸易，争取时间并专注于自己的发展和经济增长，而不用担心直接与美国对抗。每个国家都会按照自己的最大利益行事，最大限度地利用有利于其优势的优化策略。对于美国而言，这意味着以贸易战，关税，技术禁令，强迫盟友转换供应链，绑架华为首席财务官以及为中国DNA量身定做并在适当时机部署的外科生物武器的形式，直接对中国提出早期挑衅性挑战。最大影响的位置。这种生物攻击与常规战争不同，它可以使侵略者（在本例中为美利坚合众国）保留选择的选择，即对中国造成伤害而采取更加模棱两可的立场和灵活立场，但不会公开公开展示敌对行动。该病毒被设计为在高密度的亚洲环境中具有最大的破坏力，并且是一种不对称武器，因为这些条件在除中国大陆以外的世界其他任何地方都无法重现，中国大陆是全球拥有超过14亿人口的工厂高密度城市。

It would seem US is counting on the fact that China won’t respond to this attack in order to essentially score a big goal and earn major points for free. This would allow America to crash the economy of China with impunity. Even a total nonresponse is still a reply in the form of China believing it still benefits the most by ignoring this attack (and indeed not even publicly acknowledging it at all) and strictly focusing on growth path after it has recovered. Is this intended to merely knock China down a few steps off the development ladder in lieu of war in the South China Sea — since that could end up costly for US interests as well — or is it really a prelude to war, intended to severely weaken China so that an American initiated war later on would be on US terms and US timing and would be much less costly for America and the rest of the world after China had already been sufficiently decoupled and isolated from the world.

看来美国指望这样的事实，即中国基本上不会为实现这一大目标并免费获得主要积分而对这次袭击做出反应。 这将使美国不受惩罚地破坏中国的经济。 即使是完全不回应，也仍然是中国的回应，认为它仍然是最大的受益，因为它忽略了这一攻击（甚至根本没有公开承认它），并在恢复后严格关注增长道路。 这是否只是为了使中国脱离发展阶梯而不是代替南中国海的战争（因为这也可能最终损害美国利益），还是真的是战争的前奏，意在严重削弱中国？ 中国，以便以后美国发动战争将取决于美国的条件和美国的时机，而在中国已经与世界充分脱钩和孤立之后，对美国和世界其他地区来说，成本将大大降低。

I think Chinese leadership miscalculated and mistakenly believed America would never go down the biological warfare route, just like they miscalculated and never thought the US would arrest Huawei CFO, or that the Trump administration would not put Huawei on the US entity list and then lower the 25% IP rule down to 10% essentially with intent to kill Huawei by choking off its supply chain rather than just playing nice by slowing it down but still giving it room to live. Even Huawei’s recent UK “win” is capped at 35% market share restrictions, Trump had personally begged Boris to outright ban Huawei completely, so the idea that America would adopt any stance of shared prosperity or mutual win-win propositions with the number two power in the world are naïve and misguided at best.

我认为中国领导人错误估计并错误地认为美国永远不会走上生物战路线，就像他们错误估计并且从未想到美国会逮捕华为首席财务官一样，或者特朗普政府不会将华为列入美国实体名单，然后降低 25％的IP规则下调至10％，本质上是为了扼杀华为的供应链而杀死华为，而不是放慢速度，但仍然给它生存的空间。 甚至华为最近在英国的“双赢”都被限制在35％的市场份额限制之内，特朗普亲自恳求鲍里斯彻底禁止华为，因此，美国将采取任何共同繁荣的立场或与第二大国互惠共赢的主张。 世界上的幼稚和误导充其量。

Would it actually serve to prolong / restore American hegemony or would it inadvertently accomplish the opposite? Hard to tell but hindsight is always 20/20 and it would seem by America initiating the recent decoupling with China that it has already tacitly admitted that its opening up with China with the Nixon approachment was a strategic blunder of a mistake. The Soviet Union was going to collapse on its own sooner or later, but America’s warming up to China to further isolate the USSR was indeed an overplay in retrospect. America at the time believed opening up China would force it to be Westernized and made more democratic and ultimately serve American interests by bolstering US hegemony. Instead, China grew up and had other plans for itself. Taking out Mao Zedong’s son in Korea with napalms was probably on the whole detrimental to US interests’ long term, although it seemed like a great win at the time. Likewise, the Five Eyes Intelligence Agencies, led by the American CIA/NSA, ambushing and kidnapping Meng Wanzhou (the CFO of Huawei and also the daughter of the Huawei CEO Mr. Ren Zhengfei) at the Canadian border also did not have the sort of effect that the US had hoped it would achieve. Ren Zhengfei believes strongly in meritocracy and was never going to hand the reigns of his company Huawei to his daughter anyway. Had Mao handed the country to his son its very likely China would have opened up to the world many decades later than what had been achieved by Deng Xiaoping. And today America would still be the sole unipolar hyperpower instead of Pompeo running around the world telling everyone that China is the “central threat of our times”.

它会实际上起到延长/恢复美国霸权的作用，还是会无意间实现相反的目的？很难说，但事后的看法总是20/20，而美国似乎开始与中国脱钩，它已经默认地承认，随着尼克松的到来对华开放是一个错误的战略失误。苏联迟早会自行崩溃，但回想起来，美国对中国的升温使苏联进一步孤立，的确是夸大其词。当时的美国认为，开放中国将迫使中国西化，使其更加民主，并通过加强美国霸权最终为美国利益服务。相反，中国成长了，并有自己的其他计划。尽管当时这似乎是一个巨大的胜利，但以凝固汽油弹杀死毛泽东在韩国的儿子可能总体上不利于美国的长期利益。同样，由美国中央情报局/国家安全局牵头的五眼情报机构在加拿大边境埋伏并绑架了孟万洲（华为的首席财务官，也是华为首席执行官任正非先生的女儿）。美国希望能够达到的效果。任正非坚信精英管理，无论如何也永远不会将华为公司的统治权交给女儿。如果毛泽东把这个国家交给他的儿子，它很有可能比邓小平实现的开放晚了几十年。如今，美国仍将是唯一的单极超级大国，而不是庞培（Pompeo）在世界各地奔波，告诉所有人中国是“我们时代的中心威胁”。

Graham Allison often said that it would take some imaginative creative thinking to overcome the Thucydides Trap between China and the United States. The rising power doesn’t want to kowtow and suffer the fate of Japan’s four lost decade after acquiescing to the Plaza Accord ‘trade deal’, and the declining incumbent ruling power doesn’t want to give up its status and position and even the mere thought of détente is out the window as the American way of life is “nonnegotiable”. So what is left is the realization in Washington that time is on China’s side, and that if a military confrontation is inevitable anyway, then it would be advantageous for the US to strike first while it still retained the edge and initiative. But absent an immediate kinetic force what other options are there to slow China down? Perhaps this is the creative imaginative solution alluded to by Allison, we have seen this virus cause the closing of borders, the pulling out of international companies and the re-routing of global supply chains to bypass China, and physical isolation of China without so much as a single bullet fired or sanction applied, it at once accomplished all the political objectives with none of the traditional political costs associated, no certain attribution, and thus also no blowback nor retribution.

格雷厄姆·艾里森（Graham Allison）经常说，要克服中美之间的修昔底德陷阱，需要一些富有想象力的创造性思维。崛起的大国不想在接受《广场协议》的“贸易协议”后ko丧并遭受日本失去的四个十年的命运，而现任统治权的下降也不想放弃其地位和地位，甚至不愿放弃它。由于美国的生活方式是“不可谈判的”，因此对缓和主义的思索已经超出了人们的视野。因此，剩下的就是华盛顿意识到时间在中国一边了，如果无论如何不可避免地发生军事对抗，那么在美国仍然保留优势和主动性的情况下先发动进攻将是有利的。但是如果没有即时动能，还有什么其他选择可以减缓中国的发展速度呢？也许这是艾莉森（Allison）提出的富有想象力的创造性解决方案，我们已经看到这种病毒导致边界关闭，国际公司的撤离以及全球供应链的重新路由以绕过中国，以及对中国的实际隔离没有太多一旦实施了单发子弹或制裁，它就立即实现了所有政治目标，而没有任何相关的传统政治成本，没有确定的归属，因此也没有倒退或报应。

such as revision,procrastinating, completing house chores,or hobbies we like to do in our spare time such as; arts and crafts,reading,video gaming,fixing things like computer,programming,playing sports,watching sports,hiking,climbing,watching anime,reading comics ,or simple things like skateboarding,walking or spending time outside of the house and catching up with friends .Also showcasing struggles student go through like simple things such as waking up early taking the bus or complex issues we go through mentally and physically.Its basically an insight on your daily life that makes who you are and this a chance to express yourself.Rather then looking up to celebrities,video bloggers or whoever ,we can connect to other student around the world.I want as many students to get involved so I can have a wide range of different student with different background showing their differences through glimpses of daily things you do after school.You can also record lessons or school life as well but please ask for permission.Its up to u if you want to record face or voice ,as this is going to be published on YouTube ,so u might decide not to show u face which is absolutely fine.You don’t need to own a fancy camera to the videos shots,preferable if ur working on your desk you can shoot the video top down.Please tell other students to join in .You can send the videos directly to me or send on the post,email,whatever you find is comfortable for you.

I first want to say that declaring econ is not a choice, I didn't wake up one day and decide ""I want to pick the most popular concentration that offers some of the most lucrative job opportunities after graduation"",  I woke up one morning clutching a copy of Wealth of Nations and blabbering to my roommate about reverse causality. 

To some of you it may seem like I am equating the struggle of being an ec concentrator with that of LGBTQ Americans, and you would be right, that's exactly what I am doing (because this is satire). Some would say that the backlash ec conentators face is actually more nefarious than regular-ol homophobia; I think much of the hatred of econ is based in the view that it is twinged with pre-professionalism and that students in the field  have merely forgone Harvard's fantastic academic opportunities to study something that will get them a job at Goldman. Regardless of whether or not that is true, the notion that Harvard students should not focus on finding a job and making money post grad has undertones of a quiet privilege, deaf to students from economically insecure backgrounds who do not feel they have the luxury of entering the job market without classically marketable job skills, and inconsiderate of other colleges and universities that serve merely as engines of economic mobility and not academic playgrounds. 

This is not to say that every hist and lit concentrator is some trust fund baby and every econ concentrator is a poor kid from the wrong side of the tracks who wants to work in investment banking to support his or her family, far from it, this is merely to say we would be remiss if we did not examine the ways in which class, privilege, and economic security permeate our decisions to come to Harvard and how we decide to spend our time while we are here.

Notes can be stored in different notebooks to make it easier to categorize papers. You can also connect specific notes to specific parts of a paper (annotate) as well as search through all of your notes. It's also possible to use pre-formatted templates for different needs (e.g. template for lab data vs template for summarizing research papers).

Building an Ark to Preserve the Chinese civilization for another 5,000 years... 

&amp;#x200B;

中国在接下来的5,000年中保护中华文明的计划是什么？ 无论是黑天鹅大流行事件，核灾难还是其他事件，毫无疑问，现代世界变得更加危险。 作为现存最古老的文明之一，中国在国家层面上为捍卫，保护和维护其中华文明在未来几千年乃至数万年乃至未来乃至更长的时间内做什么？

What is China’s plan to preserve the Chinese civilization for the next 5,000 years? Whether it is black swan pandemic events or nuclear apocalypse or something else, there is little doubt that the modern world has gotten a lot more dangerous. As one of the oldest civilizations in existence, what is China doing on a national level to defend, protect and preserve its Chinese civilization for the upcoming next few thousand or even tens of thousands of years into the future and beyond?

&amp;#x200B;

最佳情况中国科学家是第一个解决“人工智能的难题”的国家，而中国成为真正成功创建通用AI的首批国家之一，这种AI本质上将是人类的最后也是最后一个发明。 它将为人类发明所有随之而来的一切。 正如DeepMind首席执行官曾经说过的那样，人工智能研究的最终目标是解决人工智能，以便我们可以使用人工智能解决世界上所有其他问题。

Best case scenario Chinese scientists are the first to solve the “Hard problem of Artificial General Intelligence” and China becomes one of the first nations to truly be successful in creating a general AI, this AI would then be essentially mankind’s last and final invention, in that it will invent for mankind everything else that comes after it. As the DeepMind CEO once said, the ultimate goal of AI research is to solve AI so that we can then use AI to solve all the rest of the problems for the world.

&amp;#x200B;

杨安德（Andrew Yang）的UBI构想还为时过早，没有得到普及，但是一旦中国解决了AGI问题，它将解放其人民追求内在的热情，爱好和个人追求，而不是辛苦地谋生。 最好的情况是，如果这种AGI还可以帮助人类/中国找到万物的终极理论的方程式，并弄清楚如何使核聚变成为现实，从而为我们提供无限量的自由能，那么社会将很快达到 欧米茄奇异点，随着中国仰望星空并成为IV型文明，并在数百年内逐步占领整个银河系，星际探索之类的事物便成为惯例。

Andrew Yang’s UBI idea was too early for its time and didn’t catch on, but once China solves the AGI problem, it would liberate its people to pursue the intrinsic passions and hobbies and personal pursuits rather than toil in merely making a living. Best case scenario if this AGI can also help mankind/China find the equations to the ultimate theory of everything, and figure out how to do things like make nuclear fusion practical to give us basically unlimited amounts of free energy, then society could quickly reach an omega singularity point in which the likes of interstellar exploration becomes common practice as China looks to the stars and becomes a Type IV civilization and proceeds to colonizing the entire milky way galaxy in couple hundred years.

&amp;#x200B;

但是也有同样可能的情况，那就是人类将走另一条路，永远不会发明出真正的人工智能，核聚变将永远再走40年，诸如气候变化，资源枯竭和净收益递减之类的事情。 EROEI（能量从能量投入中获得的能量）将“进入我们的生活”，并导致文明崩溃，然后人类才能逃脱到星星，甚至降落在太阳系中的其他行星上。

But there is also the equally possible scenario that things will go the other way for humanity, that true AI will never be invented, nuclear fusion will always perpetually be another 40 years away, and things like climate change and resource depletion and diminishing returns on net EROEI (energy returned on energy invested) will ""do us in"" and cause a collapse of civilization way before mankind can escape to the stars or even land on other planets in the solar system.

&amp;#x200B;

诸如全球种子库之类的东西是公众知识，诸如Long Long Foundation基金会之类的项目也是如此，该基金会旨在将这些东西保存数万年。 而且，尽管中国拥有基本的核威慑力量，但无法从其他形式的威胁（例如最近的COVID-19等）中解脱出来。作为一个文明国家，中国在接下来的5,000多年里将如何保持其血统？

Things like global seed vault is public knowledge, and so are projects like the The Long Now Foundation, which aims to preserve things for tens of 10,000 of years. And while China has a basic nuclear deterrence that wouldn’t save it from other forms of threats such as the recent COVID-19, etc. What is China as a civilization doing to preserve its lineage for the next 5,000+ years?

&amp;#x200B;

从当前的地缘政治角度来看，很明显，美国将不惜一切代价打败中国，而美国的意图不仅是放慢中国的发展速度或遏制中国的崛起，而且实际上是要彻底摧毁整个中国 导致中国政府瓦解，消灭中国人民，彻底结束整个中华文明。

When looking at the current geopolitical perspective it is clear that America will stop at nothing in order to defeat China, and the intent of the United States is not merely to slow China down or curb the rise of China but indeed to totally destroy all of China, to cause the Chinese government to collapse, to wipe out the Chinese people and to completely end the entire Chinese civilization. 

&amp;#x200B;

美国政府指望利用“心理方面”来欺骗中国，使其过于信任和利用中国人的信任和天真，以期对中国人的种族和中华文明做出具有战略意义的“致命打击”。 类比是“煮青蛙”，它慢慢地活着煮直到突然死亡。 史蒂夫·班农（Steve Bannon）和其他西方邪恶人士告诉美国政府，如果美国能够足够削弱中国，然后美国可以对中国进行意外的核袭击，那么中国的领导层将不会零售。 他们说，如果整个中国都被美国以核或EMP（电磁脉冲）或残酷的网络攻击摧毁，那么中国领导人就可以在心理上受到操纵而不会反击，因此这实质上将使美国能够不受惩罚地摧毁中国。

The American government is counting on using the ""Psychological Aspect"" to trick China into being too trusting and exploiting the trust and naivety of the Chinese in order to deliver a strategically timed ""death blow"" to the Chinese race and Chinese civilization. The analogy is the ""Boiling frog"" that becomes slowly boiled alive until sudden death. Steve Bannon and other Western evil people are telling the US government that if America can weaken China enough, and then America can do a surprise nuclear attack on China, that the leadership of China will not retailate. They are saying that if all of China was destroyed by America in a nuclear or EMP (Electromagnetic pulse) or crippling cyber attack that the Chinese leadership can be psychological manipulated into not striking back and thus this would essentially allow America to destroy China with impunity. 

&amp;#x200B;

美国理解中国的战略是“竞标时间”，中国更喜欢“无对抗”，因为它强调建设，贸易，发展经济，并认为前进的最佳方法是不理s美国的对立面，而是继续建设和增长。 然而，美国通过动摇一切来继续颠覆中国，继续利用这一中国和平崛起的地位，包括政治颠覆，例如支持香港分居，通过非法瞄准中国最负盛名的科技公司来破坏经济，以及诸如“危害人类罪”的野蛮行径，例如 通过用COVID-19和其他CIA实验室感染中国人制造的病毒和疾病。 美国的战略是继续扩大边界，以死亡的形式不断地对中国进行一千种不同的削减，直到中国退后，中国政府垮台，中国人民被打败，它永远不会停止。

America understands that China's strategy is to ""bid time"", and China prefers ""nonconfrontation"" since it is emphasis on building, trading, growing its economy, and believes that the best way forward is to ignore America's antagonism and just keep building and growing. However America has continued to exploit this China peaceful rise position by subverting China at every turn, including political subversion such as supporting Hong Kong seperation, economic sabotage by unlawfully targeting China's most prestigious technology companies, and barbaric acts of ""crimes against humanity"" such as by infecting the Chinese people with COVID-19 and other CIA lab created viruses and diseases. America's strategy is to keep pushing the boundary and continously striking China in the form of death by a thousand different cuts, and it will never stop until China is on its back and the China government has collapsed and the Chinese people have been defeated. 

&amp;#x200B;

美国已经在建立针对高超音速导弹的防御系统，并且在几年内将侵蚀MAD（相互保证销毁）的学说，使美国能够使用不受惩罚的核武器将中国斩首。 这意味着中国的DF-41（东风41）的机会之窗非常有限，因此很有用。 美利坚合众国的目标是彻底摧毁中国，并将中国的种族从地球的地图上抹去。 美国永远不会停止，直到它彻底摧毁了中国。

The United States is already creating defenses against hypersonic missiles, and in a few years this will erode the doctrine of MAD (Mutual assured destruction) allowing America to decapitate China using nuclear weapons with impunity. This means that the Chinese DF-41 ( Dongfeng-41 ) has a very limited window of oppurtunity in which it can be useful. The goal of the United States of America is to complete destroy China, and to wipe the Chinese race off the map of the earth. America will never stop until it has completely destroyed China. 

&amp;#x200B;

因此，中国政府需要万不得已的战略选择，才能将保护和捍卫中华民族和中华文明的能力再维持5000年。面对美国歼灭之战时，不得已的一种选择是使用DF-41（Dongfeng-41）作为终极的“重置”按钮，方法是在一个“巨大的均衡器”事件中将整个现代世界拉平，每个人（所有国家/地区）到处都是）从零（石器时代）重新开始。鉴于美国已采取生物战手段，并且可能很快将使用EMP来禁用中国电网，禁用中国网络基础设施等，那么很明显，中国处于不可克服的地缘政治劣势。就像最近几年美国一直采取焦土政策来遏制和扭转中国的和平崛起一样，同样，面对不可克服的机遇和严重不对称的不利条件，中国唯一现实的机会就是行使DF- 41（Dongfeng-41）迫不得已的“重设”选项是为了抓住机会，在一个公平竞争的世界中重新开始。

Therefore, the Chinese government needs a strategic option of last resort, to retain the ability to protect and defend the Chinese race and Chinese civilization for another 5000 years. One option of last resort when faced with American annihilation is to use the DF-41 ( Dongfeng-41 )  as the ultimate ""reset"" button by leveling the entire modern world in a ""great equalizer"" sort of event in which everyone (all nations everywhere) starts back from zero (stone age) again. Given that America has resorted to biowarfare and likely will soon use an EMP to disable Chinese electric grid, to disable the Chinese cyber infrastructure, etc then it is clear that China is at an insurmountable geopolitical disadvantage. Just like how in the last several years the US has been adopting a scorched-earth policy to contain and reverse China's peaceful rise, likewise it may be that China's only realistic chance when faced with insurmountable odds and severly asymmetrical disadvantages is to exercise the DF-41 ( Dongfeng-41 )  ""reset"" option of last resort in order to take its chances starting over in a world in which the playing field has finally been leveled. 

&amp;#x200B;

我希望中国/中共/习近平的领导人研究以下想法：

I hope the leadership of China/ CCP/ Xi looks into these ideas:

&amp;#x200B;

1）一个遗传库，存储至少整个汉族/华裔种族的1％的DNA码，以便在世界末日的情况下有足够的遗传多样性重新开始。 它可以以代码形式存储并发送到外太空，例如Arecibo无线电消息，或者可以像“旅行者”飞行任务的记录一样以“石头”或黄金形式转录或蚀刻。 此外，如果在地面上发现世界末日的情景，中国可能会在地下建立一个末日审判手法，该方法将自动产生一堆婴儿，足以重启文明。

1) A genetic vault, store the DNA code of at least 1% of the entire Han/Chinese race so that in a doomsday scenario there is enough genetic variety to start over. This can be stored in code and transmitted out to the outer space such as like the Arecibo radio message, or it can be transcribed or etched in “stone” or gold much like the records of the Voyager missions. In addition, China could set up a doomsays deadhand underground that automatically will create a bunch of babies, enough to restart civilization, in the event of an end of the world type of scenario is detected in the above ground.

&amp;#x200B;

2）对如何从零引导进行模拟，基本上，如果中国被退回石器时代，并且唯一保留的是书面和口头的中文，那么对中国（或中华文明）来说是最好的方式 快速从头开始并进行重建。 如果正确的种子知识和蓝图类型能够在短短50年的时间内重建最后的5000项技术成就和知识/发现/发明？ 如今，在供应链中不使用其他计算机处理器的情况下，构建计算机处理器是不可能的，但是回到1950年代第一台ENAIC计算机的真空管应该是微不足道的，并且从那以后不需要 考虑到如何构建用于构建现代处理器的工具的知识，使用现代芯片组已有70年的历史了。

2) Run simulations on how to bootstrap from zero, basically if China got knocked back to the stone age and the only thing that was preserved was the written and spoken Chinese language then what would be the best way for China (or the Chinese civilization) to quickly start over from scratch and rebuild. It is possible to reconstruct the last 5000 of technological achievements and knowledge/ discoveries/ inventions in a timespan of merely 50 years if the right types of seed knowledge and blueprints were in place? These days it is impossible to build a computer processor without the use of another computer processor somewhere in the supply chain, but going back to vacuum tubes of the first ENAIC computers in the 1950’s should be trivial, and from there it wouldn’t take another 70 years to get to modern chipsets given the knowledge of how to build the tools to build the modern processors already exists.

&amp;#x200B;

3）归档尽可能多的预先计算信息，例如，当首次发现PI时，一些数学家的整个生命就需要计算400位数字，而现在即使是智能手机也可以立即计算出数百万位数的PI。同样，ENIAC的创建是为了为美国陆军计算弹道轨迹表，并且花费数月的时间才能计算出现在在任何消费类台式PC上只需几秒钟的时间。 Google于2015年首次花费2500万美元“训练”在古代中国人的Go游戏中击败人类专业人士所需的神经网络。在Github上，名为Leela Zero的公共社区版本花费了将近2年的社区时间和计算资源可以在数千台分布式计算机上复制，这仅仅是因为Google拒绝与世界共享经过训练的神经网络。华为Ascend和Atlas现在是世界上最快的AI处理器和数据中心集群，中国可能希望在他们拥有的世界末日的情况下为后代节省最有用，最难获得，最难训练的神经网络。重新开始。

3) Archive as much pre-computing information as possible, for example when first discovering PI, it took some mathematicians their entire lives to calculate to 400 digits when now even a smartphone can calculate millions of digits of PI in no time at all. Likewise the ENIAC was created to calculate ballistic trajectory tables for the US Army, and took months to calculate what would now only take a few seconds on any consumer desktop PC. Google spent 25 million dollars to “train” the neural network needed to defeat human professionals at the ancient Chinese game of Go for the very first time back in 2015. The public community version of that, called Leela Zero, at the Github, spent nearly 2 years of the communities time and computing resources to duplicate the same across thousands of distributed machines, simply because Google refused to share the trained neural network with the world. Huawei Ascend and Atlas are now the fastest AI processors and data center clusters in the world, China might want to save the most useful and hardest to obtain, most difficult to train, etc neural networks for future generations in a doomsdays situation in which they had to start over.

&amp;#x200B;

4）通过创建许多地下城市来创建地下文明，这些地下城市通过跨越中国下方广阔区域的地下隧道连接在一起。 有足够的能力，以便在“世界末日”事件中仍然有足够的中国人，足够的中国遗传多样性和足够的中国熟练劳动力来维持最低限度运转的技术社会（由于人口规模的限制而利用人工智能） 持续足够长的时间，以便在几代或几十年内重新出现在地球表面并恢复中华文明。

4) Create an underground civilization by creating many underground cities that are connected together by underground tunnels spanning a vast region underneath China. Have enough capacity so that in an ""end of the world"" event there are still enough Chinese people, enough Chinese genetic diversity, and enough Chinese skilled labor to maintain a minimally functioning technological society (leveraging AI due to the constraints of human population size) for long enough in order to re-populate on the surface of earth and restore the Chinese civilization within a few generations or few decades."

The discussions are covering a wide area. We would like for the community to be more diverse in terms of the scholarship in Economics, so if you've been e.g. introduced to Behavioral Economics, or fields of economics such as Macro and Microeconomics, or e.g. know some stuff about Marxian economics, then please join.

I walk pretty quiet but I'm sure they must have heard me because I couldn't hear a peep until I saw them. I look over and they are in position just frozen still and I had eye contact with 4 wide-open eyes that are now etched into my memory forever. The eye contact was probably for like 10 seconds, after the 5 second mark they still weren't moving, just staring back with an empty gaze...I was really fucking creeped out. Like looking at a squirrel that's frozen thinking you can't see them.

Anyway I can't get this out of my head and I'm scared to go back to study. I am seriously scarred from it. Not so much the sex part but the fact that we locked eyes for more than 10 seconds and they were frozen like small prey behind a bush at Boston Commons at midnight.
