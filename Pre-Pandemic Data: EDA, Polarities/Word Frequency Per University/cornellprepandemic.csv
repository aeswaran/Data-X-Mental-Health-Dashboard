We're reprising an idea from last year where we post a thread for all of you to rant about whatever and generate some nice copypastas for the meme page. A few ground rules:   
1. No racist/sexist/etc. stuff, obviously  
2. No circlejerking about the lack of soda, it's been done to death already    
3. No rants about the classBot (or lack thereof). If you want to bitch about classBot you are welcome to contribute to the repository [here](https://github.com/CornellClassBot/CornellClassBot) instead.     
   
Feel free to post your uncensored opinions, subject to the ground rules above. Want to rant about how long club fair is after the start of the semester? Has Gries already insulted your mother on piazza? Maybe you think Labor Day is a useless holiday that causes too harsh a toll on the finances of corporations. All of these are acceptable rant topics! Go crazy guys."

Sorry for the dumb questions, just trying to get an idea of what I should focus more time on and how I should be writing these.

Note: if anyone would feel comfortable sharing me the essays they wrote that would be great help. I know that most rather not, and I respect that since they are yours.

I am very passionate specifically about AI research, like machine learning and computer vision, which is one of the prime reasons I decided to early decision to Cornell (my other dream school is Stanford, but its way too risky to apply there early, because no matter how good you are, there's some guy with quadruple legacy and a magically stunning essay that will beat you).

One of the largest selling points to me about Cornell is the presence of incredible opportunities, particularly in research and computer science. Thus, I'd like to be a Presidential Research Scholar. My main question is whether the program actually tells me if I am a scholar in December if I get in, or if later in March, after comparing me to all applicants. I really value the connections with this particular research scholarship.

Thanks for listening, and I appreciate any comments you may have! Please forward this to someone you know who applied ED to Cornell and got admitted to RCPRS as a freshman if you can. I appreciate it!"

The job prospects are probably pretty similar, but since I plan on an MS at Stanford (for the SV connections), I think Cornell might be harder to be the top in compared to Penn. Honestly, I'm having a pretty tough time deciding between Cornell and Penn because they're both pretty great for CS, and while Cornell is a bit like a state school in how big the classes are, Penn's weaker program beats Cornell because each student gets individual attention. Also, does Cornell CS have recitations? Because if it does, it might render the point of the classes being huge moot. Please lmk what you guys think ab this, I've done all the research I could and I'm honestly at a standstill.

&amp;#x200B;

1. CAMP Office hours. I literally lived at Office Hours for every class - get the basics and fuck the rest. Actually learning is for suckers or geniuses; you will do best if you grasp the basics and get the answers to every HW out of the TAs. Find the TA(s) that are most lenient with 'helping' you.
2. FUCK exams. I was always AT BEST at the median and literally bombed the rest but my excellent HW/project average, from tip #1, balanced it out. Most exams I had NO CLUE what I was doing on like 70% of the problems - Lin Alg, CS 3110, etc etc. 
3. Do the BARE MINIMUM to get by. Cut corners everywhere you can. Spend the first few weeks getting to know the class and figure out if/when you can skip classes, skip reading, don't do optional/bonus work, etc.
4. Take the EASIEST CLASSES you can. Self explanatory. Oceanography, Philosophy, Networks whatever the fuck suits your fucking fancy.
5. Above all - don't party, don't drink, don't join a frat, and do go to the gym. Cornell is only as hard as you make it out to be, and you'll forget 80% of that shit within a year anyway so why die trying.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're actually smart, by all means do as well as you can. For the rest of us, the above will get you the piece of paper you're at Cornell for with the least amount of stress as humanly possible. Of course, you're still stuck in the shithole town of Ithaca for 4 years, and at the end of the day I'd caution anyone from attending.

This is specifically targeted at engineering/CS students because let's be real..the rest of the schools are easy and not worth your time/money (looking @ you gender studies)."

# I hate the new cocktail lounge 

I honestly believe that most of the new changes made to the Cocktail Lounge were deliberately made specifically to piss **me** off. I get that this is a much less popular opinion than ""The Cornell Daily Sun is a garbage publication"" but I HAVE TO get this shit off my chest (and really, really don't feel like doing StatMech).

Everything about the old cocktail lounge was *perfect*. I spent more time in Cocktail than in my own home during my sophomore year. The blue mini-couches that you could put side by side to create the perfect sleeping pod, the chairs were at the perfect height so you wouldn't strain your neck after 12 hours of work, and the sloped foot areas in the islands and two-seaters were great. Now look at this god-forsaken mess. If you're new to the subreddit or a freshman, you're in for a ride, I'm about to do what I do best: bitch and moan like a 16 year old teen on reality television as an excuse to avoid doing work. 

## The Central Lounge:
You know what I'm talking about. The area where cocktail 'bends'. They used to have the comfiest seats on campus. I get why they decided to swap out the old chairs (if they aren't on sale anymore, and I'm pretty sure they haven't been cleaned since the 80s), but the new purchases are just fucking stupid. 

With all the new furniture, its virtually impossible to get through this area without bumping into someone and getting a rude glare, or cutting through their seating area and awkwardly tripping over a power cord. The tall chairs are also sore on the eyes. The whole area is just so... crowded. 

Also, one of the main advantages of the old chairs was that they were relatively mobile. You could move them around and people often did, moving them from table to table. These new ones are ridiculously large and **are obviously meant to not be moved**. Whoever was in charge of this dumpster fire wasn't smart enough to figure this out when they moved these chairs in and out in the spring of 2017, because now they've put these weird maxi-pad looking slippers under all the legs so that the weight of the chair is spread across a large area and the friction is decreased so that people can move around the chairs if they want to. But they're so large and there's so many that there's no way that you can move them to different tables even if you wanted to. So now, people have just been pushing them further and further back from the center tables and they're taking up what little space there used to be to move through the area. 

Why the in the name of fuck did they get rid of 2/3 of the stairs that allow you to get to the lower area, while simultaneously crowd up the main way people get down there? Now there's two tiny glass patios with small clusters

One thing I actually do like though is the fact that they put desks by the large window. Although, this area is basically uninhabitable for most of the year from like 3PM to sunset since the sun shines directly through there (which was the original intention of the window) so guess they really didn't think things through. Also, they removed most of the seating by the original entrance, so I think it pretty much evens out. 

## The Desks: 
These just fucking suck. There's no way around it. I have **huge** qualms about one specific thing, but I'm gonna save that for a separate point. 

First of all, the new chairs are all swivel, which I personally hate, but thats a 'me' issue. I think most people can agree that they're worse than the previous blue iteration though. They also just completely forgot about the conscious decision made in the original design to reduce neck strain. 

The've swapped the old desk material (actual wood) for plastic with a wood pattern printed onto it. This may not seem like a big deal, but when people at the next pod over shake their table (includes dropping textbooks, slamming their fist in frustration, or even bumping the desk as they push their chair in), this shakes your table due to the cheaper material. You'd think with 60k+ tuition from all of us, they'd be able to afford the thing that trees are made out of, especially when there's so many of them in this frozen asshole of a town but nope. 

Also, they added frosted glass dividers which are asymmetrical. They're glossy on one side and sand-blasted on the other. This means light passes through differently from both sides. Stupid. 

## The Charging ports on the Desks:

My **only** issue with cocktail before was the lack of charging ports. They made a good decision when they decided to add ports to every single desk. Too bad they completely fucked it up. Why the fuck would you put them in the center of the desk. *This makes no fucking sense from a student's perspective*. A **lot** of people work with their laptop pushed back and have a notebook in front of it to take notes from pdf textbooks/lecture videos or if they're some basic bitch, they watch The Office/Friends (there are better shows out there now, cmon) while working. This is impossible to do with the charging port **sticking out of the desk**. The obvious choice is to have the ports under the desk, but the desks by the window have the ports flush with the surface which solve this issue, and they still are better than this garbage. 

The light stations at the triplet tables are even worse. Not only do you have less desk space to begin with, but the outlet is facing the user. So when you stick in your charger, you get even less room (nearly half the width of the desk if you have a fat powerbrick). They put the USB ports on the right of the stations, and put nothing on the left, so not only is the cord that takes up less room on the side that the outlet should be on, but they just left *the other side* with fuck all to do. 

Also, all of these ports are USB-A which, while prevalent now, will eventually get phased out (new iPhones are all using USB-C). If this redesign is supposed to last just as long as the original cocktail lasted, you're starting off pretty piss poor. 

## The New Triplets

*Why would you remove the wall between the desks that are opposite of each other?* Before there used to be a nice circular surface that was carpeted and felt good under the feet. Now there's just another person's feet, leading to *countless* awkward moments where you accidentally play footsie with a stranger. The worst part is, you can't act like a normal human being whenever it happens. Since there's frosted glass between you and the other person, its not like you can look at them and apologize with a ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. You just have to awkwardly pretend like neither of you guys noticed. 

## The Printer Area and New Couch Area

Cocktail already has a problem with **people not treating it like the whisper zone it is**. But let's put a loud machine here, even though there was already like 3 of these just 10 seconds away and see what happens. Also, let's put large seating arrangements like they have in the Hotelie 'Library', where its constantly loud, and blissfully ignore the fact that its hard to shush people that are behind a wall thats 10 feet tall, from 5 feet below. There's already a garbage where people can talk and 'work' in couched areas without tables called Mann. 

## The Private Rooms

These were always poorly insulated due to the giant gap under the door, so when you had a group of friends fill one of these up like a clown car and scream at each other, everyone in the library could hear everything. But let's replace the walls with glass (that does fuck all to insulate noise) and point and laugh as /u/EQUASHNZRKUL loses his shit. That's the only plausible explanation for this decision - someone's deliberately doing this to piss me off.

## The South Entrance

There's probably a good reason they shut this entrance off 30 years ago. I have no idea what it was, but I have a bunch of new ones now. When people are talking before they enter a library, they usually don't just cut off the conversation then and there. They let it continue for a sentence or two and then quiet down. The thing is, this usually happened at the Main Entrance, so by the time people got to Cocktail, they would shut the fuck up. Now you have this bullshit happening in the actual area where a ton of people are trying to do work. Its a convenience sure, but how much time are you really saving? I don't think its worth the constant interruptions of the wailing alarm, but that's just my opinion. I think most people do appreciate this change though, so I'm putting it all the way down here, where you've (hopefully) stopped reading. 

## The New Bathrooms:

The got rid of the graffiti and one of the urinals. That's all I have to say about that. 

## Wifi Connectivity:

I don't know what the fuck happened, but I've been confirming with other people and it seems like wifi connectivity has definitely become an issue in some places. Its definitely not a bandwidth issue, since I've had issues late at night when Cocktail is nowhere near its full capacity. 

## TL;DR
Whoever was in charge of the redesign obviously has a propensity to fuck up most decisions. Most of the changes are indefensibly for the worse, and the ones that *are* of any utility come at the cost of Cocktail devolving into a bunch of people talking at full volume and annoying everyone else in the area. All in all, I'm just disappointed I waited a semester for this."

I joined one but chose to quit after a bit because it just wasn't a productive use of time. I felt like it was more worth it to instead participate in say, a more recreational club, or just have free time to do other hobbies, and also have more time to really focus on classes. Kind of felt like free labor TBH.  

Obviously I know there are a lot of great project teams out there that people love being apart of. I just wanted to put it out there that they really aren't always a worthwhile experience.

Has anyone else had negative experiences in project teams?"

I asked her not to stay in the dorm the next day because we were going to get loud. She tells me she'll be in some library studying which would have been perfect except she came back at like 5 am because she ""supposedly"" could not sleep in the library, when the guy I was hooking up with was in her bed and now she hasn't talked to me since.

Holomont Technologies, Inc. is a Cornell-affiliated, early-stage technology startup incorporated in May 2017 which focuses on **consumer-oriented mobile app development and IoT communication hardware**. We are **a productivity and efficiency company**. We obsess over saving our customers time and effort. Currently, we aim to **revolutionize points of transaction** by eliminating the 'wait line' and facilitating information exchange at an unprecedented speed and scale. We're starting by tackling professional events (i.e. career fairs, trade shows, networking events) and common appointments (i.e. doctor visits, job interviews).

Beyond the formal, standard 'blurb' about our company that we share with investors, we aim to be Cornell's **first 'company'-'project team' hybrid**. As many of you may have noticed, our marketing headline is ""Rejected from a project team?"" (or some variant) and makes very little mention of our actual line of products. This is for good reason. **We aim to provide as many driven and committed Cornell students as possible with the opportunity to be part of an impactful organization and own equity in their work output.** We've taken the best elements of a project team and merged them with the core elements of a company. To that end, when you join Holomont Technologies, Inc., you will have **a unique level of independence and influence** on the direction of our company. Unlike at traditional project teams, you are not working for free, to further someone else's vision, or towards a meaningless competition with us. Our aim is to empower you with the platform and tools to envision, develop, and market app-oriented ideas that have a major impact on the Cornell community and (hopefully) the world, while keeping an eye on our productivity and efficiency focus and another eye on profitability.

We are looking to hire for many roles from marketing to engineering to everything in between. We have a couple of senior-level executive positions and many entry-level positions. We want you! If you are interested in working for this unique type of early-stage technology startup, consider applying for a position at [**apply.holomont.com**](http://apply.holomont.com/).

This club would be called ""Let Them Eat Cake"", modeled after the idea that if we students can't ""get that bread"", we should at least be allowed to eat cake. 

So, of course, this club would have no application process, and everyone is welcome to join. During our weekly or biweekly meetings, students would all get together to enjoy a slice of cake or another type of snack and commiserate with each other over our problems at Cornell.

I've seen that a lot of people suffer from Imposter Syndrome at Cornell. Despite the fact that we're at one of the top institutions in America, excessive competitiveness and this inherent need to show off or act confident lead to a toxic or depressing environment where none of us (or a small amount of us) can feel truly confident.

Let me know what you think of the idea! I'm not sure if an organization like this could be approved, but I was wondering how all of you guys felt about it."

Some background: My school offers a lot of math and science classes, and so I've taken some accelerated math courses (from pre calc up to Calc AB), and I really got into physics (AP 2, C Mechanics &amp; EM), but I'm also part of the design major at my school. So I'm really passionate about art and design, and I wanna see if I can expand that passion into Architecture here. Anyway:

1. What's it like paying for a five-year course? Is it significantly more challenging than a traditional four years? 
2. Any small things that makes you think arch stands out at Cornell? I've heard so pretty good things, but I'd like to hear some firsthand experiences 
3. Do you love what you do as an arch major? 

Thanks, and sorry if these questions are annoying. I know there's an admissions thread, but I have no idea how to get there or if this should be there. To be honest, I'm teetering between EP and AAP. I feel like AAP would be a fit for me as someone who's also into design, and I'd have a way to stand out between the applicants as opposed to going to EP. But an architecture education also seems quite an expensive investment, and if that's the case I wanna know if it's doable or if I'd have a good return. Thanks you guys."

Things I wanted to shout out from the top of the Clock Tower, but obviously never did. Here goes.

If you've been to PSB or Clark Hall, by the physics office, you'll see quite a few posters saying ""physics department cares"", ""how are you? No, really, how are you?"", ""Physics is inclusive"" and what not. Everyday I see those and I think to myself, ""how hypocritical can they get?"". 

I didn't come here expecting a romantic grad life, working on world-changing stuff and all. But I did want to survive. And from my first day of interactions with the professors, I've been constantly discouraged. My already low self-esteem didn't help either. Surely, professors only have the students' best interests at heart. I was so naïve I actually trusted them. I guess I wasn't used to this level of elitism because all through my school and my undergrad, I was constantly encouraged and I was really lucky to have good professors who actually cared. 

I listened. Mostly because I was hoping to work with them. ""We will deem you worthy of being considered if you prove yourself exceptional in your battles"", they said. ""I'll prove myself, elders"", I said. I did not. I won't say I'm the tail of the class, that's just hanging on, but I'm not the head either. More of the underbelly. And it definitely isn't because I'm not working hard. Despite all the corny pep talk that people will give you, I've realised that you can't always achieve what you want by working hard enough. 

Now, the ingredients are just right for my mental decline. A lot of stressed out students seek asylum at Cornell health and I did, too. I had to because I was already on medication. Need to get my pills somewhere. They're a whole different clump of unprofessionalism. Appointments are insanely hard to get, nothing ever happens on my time, and I've even had to miss a few doses because they couldn't get my medication ready on time. 

That was last year. Come summer, there's a hiatus. The sun, the birds, the breeze, the waterfalls. And poof, it's gone. Another bout of the grind starts. And I can see myself going down the same road again.

 I'm not sure where to go from here. 

I didn't want to put down people who actually do care, maybe I'm just unlucky in that I keep meeting those who only turn away. The professors that I've met don't have the slightest inkling about how to help someone, I don't expect them to actively do anything, just listen. 

I don't wish to be a drag but I was told by my psychologist that talking about it more freely would help and I don't have any other platforms. So, thou art my heathen.

If you've read till here, thank you for that. If you haven't that's okay.

I am currently a sophomore interested in transferring to CALS (major: Information Science) for the Spring semester. I was looking at the requirements to transfer ([https://admissions.cals.cornell.edu/apply/transfer/requirements/information-science/](https://admissions.cals.cornell.edu/apply/transfer/requirements/information-science/)) but the list only shows the courses required for Fall transfer not Spring transfer. Would that just mean that I need to complete half of the junior yr requirements if I want to do a spring transfer?

In the event that is true, I would need to complete 1 semester of biology to transfer. I was not aware that biology was needed (I took chem and calc-physics instead). Would this make me completely ineligible for transfer?"

Like I have to take a class on history, so I figured I'd take one on Asisn History . The prof literally white washed my entire culture. He legir became a south asian studies prof because he took a study abroad in college and fell in love with the cultures. There are so many dynamics and intrecasies he says. It is soo ancient and fascinating.

Also, like how the hell do you talk about my religion like it came out of a textbook and not even realize that there are Asian people in the classroom and give a dose of humanity to the material. The prof even strongly promotes British colonialism and doesn't try to include how cultures were ruined. 

So I was just like maybe this is just a scholarly white guy, surely the entire department can't be like this. BUT IT IS! Like how don't you have a single professor that is some color of brown (other than the ones who teach the language). This isn't okay because it means that history is being written by white people. That isn't okay.

And then to make matters worse, for that class I had to go to a South Asia Program event. I was like maybe there is some brown prof there. Thank god there is but they are mostly like econ or agriculture profs who aren't in history at all. But then, there was this white prof wearing a mala (aka a flower garland). I literally blew my shits seeing that. We put malas on our GODS, or like brides or people who die. No ordinary person wears a mala. Does that prof think he's a god????

I'm a sophomore gov major and am seriously considering Cornell in Washington this spring, and was seeking advice from someone who has done the program before.  It seems like there's a ton of gov majors in Arts and Sciences, and yet in a program that can take 50-60 kids less than 20 students are currently participating right now according to a friend who's one of them.  I'm just a little nervous about committing if it's not a more sought after program.

I'm also curious if the classes are actually better than things I could take on campus.  I understand that small classes would make me feel like I'm not ""just a number"", but it's also possible to feel that way on campus if you establish relationships with professors and advisors, etc.  In terms of having an internship, did people feel like they really gained a lot from them, more than having an internship in the summer?

Also I would love any info people could share about fun things to do/nightlife in dc.  I enjoy the party scene on campus, and won't be 21 this spring.  Did people find fun things to do?

thank you for any help anyone can offer me!"

I recently switched to humanities from stem and I’m enjoying things a lot more. Since I’m still graduating on time and I’m absolutely certain I don’t want to go to grad school right away, I’ve been hit with the realization that I need to find a job. Since my freshman, I’ve taking a Slavic language and I’ve really come to enjoy everything related to Eastern Europe and Central Asia, which my new major has provided me with a great opportunity to further explore. 

My plan atm is to teach English abroad, though the initial prospects have been underwhelming (very low pay, super long hours, high-stress, etc). I don’t want to sound entitled or like I’m going there just to be a glorified tourist, but I would be living under the poverty line in most cases relative to the states and the purchasing power of money of those counties isn’t very high either. I’m not opposed to making a below average salary, though it would be ideal if I didn’t have to struggle.

Looking for info, I’ve noticed a lot of people applying for these jobs are coming from “average” universities, if they have a degree at all. Again, not to be entitled, but I feel like my degree can give me an edge, though I’m a loss for how I can apply this effectively. Is there someone on campus I can talk to about this?"

Usually in this situation I'm just like ""YOLO, I'll just do better next round"", and mostly I tend to do better than I think (mostly), but for some reason, this one really hit hard. 

You'd think by the time you've been here for four years it's just water off a duck's back, but I just feel broken. In the grand scheme of things it's not the end of the world, but it's hard to not feel so broken and have awful thoughts.

I feel on the surface, I might be considered to be in a very enviable position as far as job prospects and academics (outside of that one prelim class), but it doesn't mean shit to me. It's just hard to find any joy when there's this cloud blocking anything positive and this most recent prelim just hit me like a brick.  

How are you supposed to move forward from this?"

I've known for years that I struggle with anxiety and occasionally depression, but I never thought I had ADHD until now. We are still in the process of testing me and figuring out what medication and accommodations are best, but that will take 1-2 months, so until then, does anyone have any tips for succeeding at Cornell when you have this disability? I, as with just about everyone here, did really well in high school, and cruised by without studying because I went to a very easy, low-income public school, and while my teachers picked up on some issues that I had, they still gave me As and turned the other cheek because they had students with far far greater problems to worry about. Now, I've been doing very poorly since I've been here. I'm a sophomore, I have an unemployable, low GPA, and I am basically incapable of: getting all my work done on time, getting to class on time, remembering to do things, bringing materials to class, etc, and I piss my teachers off basically every day, and of course lose participation credit, shit like that, all the time. Last year, in chem 2070, i would routinely get 60% on what were actually pretty decent lab reports that would have otherwise gotten 80-90% because i'd hand them in 2-3 days late every week because I couldn't stop fucking up and managing my time poorly. It takes me 4 hours to do something we are expected to do in 1 because I get so distracted and exhausted. I get yelled at in lecture for going on my phone or a TA tells me to stop going on Reddit, when I didn't even realize I was doing that. All of this piles up, and halfway through the week, I lose all motivation to focus, or do anything really, and sometimes even stop attending class, (yes I know that's bad). Sorry, this is super long, but does anyone have any advice? Please do not respond if you don't know anything about ADHD/related problems or do not believe it is a real thing."

Recently, there are lots of posts about the protests happened in Hong Kong, and people also talk about this on campus or here. I actually have complicated feelings. On one hand, I stand firmly for people's freedom, including their rights to elect their leaders. On the other hand, I see people have different views against the protesters get attacked and insulted. I believe you guys have seen a lot videos recording the policemen beating the protester. I am going to share with you guys what happening in Hong Kong now is the protesters are scaring and attacking people who have different opinions: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-GR88q8pIw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-GR88q8pIw) This one is the protesters destroying shops and banks:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etahicd5htQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etahicd5htQ). I am not trying to justify which side, but I want people to think about this critically. When you become the people who are targeted by a large crazy group, will you feel comfortable seeing these posters around the campus? I am not supporting people tearing the posters off, but I want you guys understand the reasons behind that. 

Last but not least, I sincerely hope people in Hong Kong will eventually get their freedom, but in a more peaceful way."

And I do disagree with the actions of some students tearing down the sticker, I think they should be make their own voice instead of silencing other. It's is truly sad to see 21st century college student has no idea how democracy work.

But the thing is everything has 2 sides, and all I see on this subreddit is such a bias, that when a student stand up and simply implied that maybe, just maybe the protest has gone too violent for not just Hong Kong people, but anyone that travel through this international financial hub. If you are calling anyone, who maybe just got scared by all the violent, a oppressor of Hong Kong people, what difference does it make between you, and the guy that tears down the stickers? Everyone should have the right to have their opinion heard, regardless of what side they are on.

I just flew out from Hong Kong this August and I live 20 miles across the river from Hong Kong, my flight was almost canceled because of the protest (and I do have friends whose flights actually got cancelled). I had to travel to Hong Kong every week to see my girlfriend working in central in July and I have never been so scared of my life for walking on the streets. Hell, I've walked the street of Baltimore at 10pm and I wasn't that scared. People are getting attacked simply because they don't support the protest (not even that they support the oppression), tourist from mainland are getting attacked simply because they don't speak Cantonese. I'm not saying you should suddenly turn against the protest, but maybe, just maybe, try to looking things more peacefully and subjectively and stopped attacking people on the forum for may be just a little concerned about the protest. Like a mentioned in the other post before, even CNN is calling the protest violent in their articles. I'm all for democracy, which is one of the reason I am here in the States. I truly sympathize Hong Kong teennagers on a lot of things, including having no future at all when the housing price is insane and the government is controlled by money when because they they can't directly choose their leader. But their should be a more peaceful way out, both the protestor and the government can do a better job."

When Im doing stuff with you all of my problems melt away and I feel something inside of me that I havent felt in a really really long time. Even if Im having the worst day, just being around you is enough to lighten my mood so much. Likewise, when youre feeling like shit its really hard for me to resist hugging you and telling you everythings going to be okay. We have so much in common its crazy and I wish that we could spend more time together outside of class.

Recently its become clear to me through certain events that we're classmates first and (barely) friends second, and I get it. I dont view myself too highly, so the idea of someone liking me as much as I like them is completely foreign to me.

My main reason for being interested in ECE is that they do some programming as well as have a better fundamental understanding of computers (since they study more hardware).

Basically, my question is:

Assuming I'm interested in CS and ECE, but am leaning towards a future CS job, should I:

\-Double Major in CS and ECE (which I heard is insanely difficult)

\-Major in CS and Minor in ECE

\-Major in ECE and Minor in CS (possibly pursuing a Masters in CS but not sure how possible that is considering my Major would be ECE and I could risk not getting into a good masters program because I didn't major in CS)

Look, we understand that you have views that disagree with what you see on the stickers. The truth is, there is merit to the arguments on both sides, and I expect both pro- and anti- HK situation supporters to come to this conclusion themselves: there are arguments, sometimes non-malicious arguments, on both sides that are valid.

So when it comes to seeing stickers you disagree with, there is no reason to peel them off. Print your own stickers, and put them up nearby if you have to, but don't attempt to silence the voices of your fellow students by peeling off their stickers. The one thing we need to learn from recent Chinese/HK history is that attempting to silence people's voices often results in something far more momentous than intended. Thanks, and have a great day :)"

These are some honest questions from someone who kind of followed the news around Hong Kong but doesn't really know the full details of everything. Would really appreciate insights from people from Hong Kong or alums that are currently at Hong Kong.

1. I learned that the the extradition law was officially withdrawn  a few weeks earlier. Are people still protesting and parading for the other appeals in the Five Appeals that have not been addressed by the HK government? If so which specifics ones are the most concerning appeals for HK people?
2. I also learned that a big part of the riot at HK this past weekend is about the recently passed Anti-mask law in HK. But isn't it true that most western countries have a similar law? Apparently in NY, it is ""illegal to congregate in public with two or more people while each wearing a mask or any face covering which disguises your identity"", which seems to be a harsher law to the one passed in HK, which targets only people participating in a parade over 30 people. Are HK people dissatisfied with how the law is hastily pushed by the government?"

I’m a high school senior, and tomorrow is the last day I have before I have to tell my school which college I am applying ED to.
For a long time, I’ve always wanted to go to Cornell.
However, I’ve been wondering whether it would be the right environment for me. 

High school has not been the best experience for me. I’ve lost a lot of weight since freshman year due to stress, and I regularly get about 3 hours of sleep. My high school is extremely competitive, and reflecting on this, I think I shouldn’t go to a college with a similar environment. Furthermore, because I am underweight, I have a very low tolerance for the cold. 

Of course, I want to be challenged, but I would also like to finally be able to focus on my health. If anyone has any advice or can offer insight to life @Cornell, I would greatly appreciate it! Thank you."

Seeing this is so heartbreaking so I think maybe I should post this.
Things in advance: 
1. I’m a Chinese but I don’t stand for communist party, they do things I that I don’t agree.
2. I’m not using this to testify any of my points in HK issue, those are different things.
3. Sorry for using the word Muslim and Uyghur, I don’t mean to offend anyone, I’m just quoting the word from the original controversial sentence. I have Muslim friends and they are wonderful. And also, thank those Muslims who voluntarily save people in those accidents, thank you.
4.  For people who said or didn’t say but believe in “genocide” in Xinjiang, if it is because you never heard about things below, I don’t blame you; for those with special intent to comparing Xinjiang with HK issue, to testify any of your political points, FUCK YOU.

For the guy who talked about “genocide going with the Uyghur and muslims”, have you ever seen people died in front of you bleeding? Have you ever seen blood flushing the road? Have you ever seen a boom explode behind you? Have you ever run with desperate fear and shaking? Well unfortunately I’ve suffered these and thanks to those terrorists under “genocide”. I saw these with my own eyes, in Jul 5th terror act (don’t know if this is the official name). I was in primary school back then, those Uyghur terrorists first marched, then set fire( this is the time I realized the danger and ran with all my shit to home), and began slaughtering. Schools were closed (that’s the only part I was happy for) and we were so scared to go outdoors. I have no idea what happened until I was told that one of the teachers in our grade was killed. They I watched the CCTV(security camera on the street) videos of that night (from my uncle,he was a camera dealer and government asked him to hand over all the videos and keep those confidential, they’re afraid those videos may cause society’s panic over the entire country). I saw them apparently trained, they only hit your head with blunt instrument, only head. And I saw a female Muslim standing on a van pointed somewhere, asking those fighters to kill one of the runners in her pointed direction. And they didn’t hurt anyone with Muslim outfit, just Han and Hui. Some relatives of my friends were killed as well, I knew this latter backed to school. 
Also, when I was in eleventh grade, they did an explosion in a grocery market (somewhere full of crowds, which means it hurts a lot!!!), I didn’t see this but I heard the boom that morning and I thought it was some construction so I went to school as usual. Unfortunately my bestie was so fucking scared to death. So lucky she took bus that morning because her father usually drove her to school and the daily route exactly passed that grocery market. She was shaking and crying when she came school, telling me she was “ so fucking close to death.” I can never forget her tune. 
You may say “oh these are just things you saw, there may be somewhere happening a genocide secretly!” I have many Uyghur friends, Hui friends, Kazak friends and Mongol friend ( the one who dodged explosion), none of them, none of their relatives were captured and been treated illegal or discriminated. I even asked them about the genocide, they said they never heard about it. 
During all these things, army of China protected us, I may not support Communist party but I cannot lie about this.
Writing until here, I have finished all my fact statements, and that’s all the thins I wanna tell you, no personal opinion, just fact statements.
Thank you for reading so long,(there may be some grammatical and word errors, sorry for that, still working on English) and next time please DO NOT JUDGE SOMETHING YOU DO NOT KNOW. Don’t consume others’ pain."

Student workers have negotiated for higher wages (when NYU organized, grad student stipends increased by 38 percent in a single year); they have expanded healthcare or negotiated for better dental/psych services; they protect against workplace harassment and unsafe lab environments; they ensure student workers are paid on time. 

At Cornell, the status quo might seem OK but we have no contract and Cornell can change the terms any time (at Columbia for example, the administration just decided to take away dental care prior to unionization). Although membership dues seem to be an issue for some people, unions promise that dues will never outstrip the amount of increased wages. I don't really understand why else folks here would be reluctant to join a union.

Unionization seems to be widely supported by the student body of most of our peer institutions so I'm really curious as to why it failed at Cornell."

As expected, every other second a loud scream or honk disrupted my train of thought as I was trying to do the exam. 

But what really got to me was the effect this racket was having on the poor guy sitting next to me. He appeared to be disabled, and every time a car honked or a screech split the air he noticeably flinched and looked like he was ready to cry. I still can't get the image of his distressed face out of my mind, and honestly this shit just pisses me off. That poor guy, who had absolutely no say in what happens to underpaid workers and was just trying to write his exam, probably ended up getting fucked over by this protest. 

I get it, you're trying to be effective by disrupting as many people as humanly possible so your movement gains attention, but you're also actively harming innocent people in the process. You never know who might be impacted by your shrill, startling noises, and I'm not talking about the people just getting mildly inconvenienced. A few years ago this probably would've triggered a panic attack and heart palpitations for me (inb4 edgelords call me a ""snowflake""), and it probably had similar effects on other people today who did not sign up to be subjected to this. Yes, shit like this is a part of life, but that doesn't mean it needs to be an *increased* part of life. 

I just wish people were better at directly targeting the actual bad guys and not innocent members of the community. The rat displays themselves were incredibly well-done and I would've been totally behind the protest if not for those awful noises."

I understand that sometimes negotiation, going through the proper channels, lobbying, etc. just don’t cut it when it comes to urgent public issues. That said, I don’t think Cornell is the place to do it as I explain below.

I found it incredibly ironic that two weeks ago my friend who is a genius AEP student and will likely work in renewable energy as an adult is going to get zeros on some physics assignments because the climate change protest composed of sorority girls and Cals hippies prevented him from turning in 2 PSets on time. 

This campus is one of the few places in the world where a loud disruptive protest for a legitimate issue could actually make the world a worse place because a much larger percentage of the population here is already “aware” of the issue and many are legitimately studying to try and solve it in the future.

The segment of the population that is being protested TO here is much smaller than that which IS protesting, and in a majority situation there is no need for dramatic calls to action, only action itself. 

If you feel so strongly about global warming that you feel the need to block traffic, make cars idle, prevent my boy from going class, and then post it on your Instagram like you just saved the world with the tired humor on your poster, but then won’t actually lobby politically, or study a field that will help solve the issue, then from me to you, go fuck yourself."

Not only is it “campus housing” located far off of campus (between Collegetown and the Commons) and buses rarely appear on time (that is, if you can even manage to figure out the bus routes), but it’s a community of food-snatching thieves and NOISE.

Construction happens every morning like clockwork around 7/7:30 am, and between the sounds of jack hammering (it goes TING TING TING TING TING, pauses for ten seconds and repeats), the crane, the bulldozer, and the grad students the next building over who’ve already kept you up all night getting drunk, you will NEVER get any sleep.

The only real perks about living in the building is the free bus pass- and again, even that isn’t worth the struggle of living here. Oh, and god forbid you MISS a bus- it’s about a twenty minute walk uphill to Collegetown, and about a forty minute walk to RPCC. Various spots on campus fall in-between.

All this is to say you should have a back-up plan, kiddos. You might think during housing selection that you’ll end up on West Campus in a suite with all your best buds, with food right downstairs to much on, but the likelihood of that happening for most of you is next to zero. Apply to a Program House or two, and be ready just in case you get the last housing timeslot like I did and have to live here. Believe me, the only food here consists of two vending machines that go out of stock within two days because of the starving residents. 

That is all. And if for whatever reason you end up here, bring your OWN mini fridge no one can steal from, a plethora of food to cook on the days buses break down and you can’t get to a dining hall, and plenty of earplugs or noise-cancelling headphones.

And with that I bid you ado. If I can help it, I’ll be somewhere far from here next semester."

Any objective onlooker would probably say that China has fared quite well in the past few decades. This assessment seems sensible. Back in the 80s the USA’s economy was more than twenty times the size of China’s, but today China has never been closer to overtaking the US as the world’s largest economy. Not all is well for China tho. I personally think that it is not a matter of ‘if,’ but ‘when,’ that the communist government will collapse, and with all the increasing power that the government wields thanks to artificial intelligence, we should expect a cataclysmic upheaval when that collapse eventually occurs. 

There’s one crucial difference between capitalism and communism: in real life, the former works and the latter doesn’t. My main goal here, however, is not to explicate the impossibility of central planning to achieve the efficiency results of capitalism in the long run. Rather, I’m trying to show what would structurally emerge from a system of long-term central planning, and hopefully convince you of the inevitable collapse of communist regimes. 

Contrary to Western popular belief, the communist party is not a band of villains trying to take control of the coercive apparatus of the state and utilize it to their own benefit at the expense of oppressing the citizens. The vast majority of communists are genuinely nice people looking for a centrally planned socioeconomic order based upon common ownership to establish a more egalitarian state. But the task is complex: any systematic central planning necessitates an immense amount of unbridled power. In fact, its very success depends on the extent to which the leaders achieve such power. So the desire to maximize power is not a cause, but a consequence of the desire to centralize decision making. 

Unfortunately, this perpetual need for absolute authority turns out to be highly dangerous, not least because it directly paves the way for totalitarianism. A totalitarian rule is and has always been a long-term logical consequence of an unscrupulous and unrestrained system of central planning. 

Note, however, that totalitarianism isn’t a synonym for failure (think the New Deal period -- not exactly a totalitarian rule, but you get the idea). That being said, totalitarianism is certainly a recipe for disaster in the long run. Everything seems fine when the economy is booming. But when something goes awry (say an economic mismanagement resulting in a national famine), everything goes south. We basically wind up with a vicious cycle, where a government crackdown on a disgruntled public leads to more public disapproval which in turn leads to more government crackdowns. And the fact that China has been making massive leaps in artificial intelligence is even more cause for alarm. One could only wish they would not be there to witness the bloodbath.  

If capitalism is the “extraordinary belief that the nastiest of men for the nastiest of motives will somehow work for the benefit of all,” then communism is the equally extraordinary tragedy where men with the best of intentions will somehow lead us all to a hellish political, social, and economic existence. Hayek had it spot-on when he said, “Is there a greater tragedy imaginable than that, in our endeavour consciously to shape our future in accordance with high ideals, we should in fact unwittingly produce the very opposite of what we have been striving for?” A great tragedy indeed."

If nothing works out, I'll have to just be a part time student, I guess. Here are the things I know about it so far:

1. You can't live in a dorm (or something like that)
2. Your financial aid or visa might get messed up
3. You can't make Dean's List (lol)

None of these things really matter to me, so I'm wondering: what are the other effects? Does it mean you can't study abroad in the future? Does it appear in big bolded letters on your official transcript or something and you look horrible? What actually happens?

1. What are the biggest differences between CS 3410 and ECE 2300 -&gt; CS 3420? I've read that 3410 is torture, but 2300 has annoying labs and 3420 is also hard? As someone who doesn't know anything about hardware but is interested in learning, which would you recommend for me? In terms of workload, which would you recommend? I think I'm leaning towards ECE 2300 -&gt; CS 3420 right now. 
2. Is taking CS 2800 (possibly + ECE 2300), CS 3410/3420, CS 3110, CS 4820, and CS 4410 over 5 semesters in that order (like the engineering handbook lays it out) okay, or should I consider a different order/taking two CS classes together? Should I worry about taking any of those classes specifically in the fall/spring to get a certain professor?
3. How the heck do math classes fit into all of this? I still have to take MATH 2940 (lin alg) and am probably planning on BTRY 3080 to replace chem/physics because I've heard it's not too awful. Would MATH 2940 + BTRY 3080 + CS 2800 + ECE 2300 be possible??? If not then which 2 or 3 should I do together next semester? 
4. I haven't even thought about the electives, should I already be trying to plan those out as a freshman or can I just chill? :'(

If anyone wants to build this custom piece of software, let me know. You will be paid for your work at a rate TBD between you and my father. You will be able to discuss the project with me IRL on campus to make all expectations very clear before you start.

I don't think the project will be all that challenging or take too long, and the only reason I don't do it myself is because I am lazy TBH. But if anyone wants this chance to get some extra cash and maybe add a side project to your resume, reach out to me!"

# What is [Cornell AppDev](https://www.cornellappdev.com/)?

Cornell AppDev is a project team at Cornell University dedicated to creating open-source applications on the App Store and Google Play Store. 

AppDev has released four apps:

### Eatery | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/eatery-cornell-dining/id1089672962) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cornellappdev.android.eatery&amp;hl=en_US)

Eatery provides an easy and accessible way to view the menus of eateries on campus and in collegetown. 

Recently, Eatery launched *Popular Times* which shows you how long it will take you to get food at Cornell's Eateries. We aggregate data from Cornell about the number of swipes at each location over a week and use that to compute the business of each food place. Popular Times is available now for Android and iOS, so update Eatery to get ahead of the crowd!

### Ithaca Transit | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ithaca-transit-live-tracking/id1290883721)

Ithaca Transit is an end-to-end navigation service for built for the TCAT bus service. A free and open-source app, Ithaca Transit offers a diverse range of features in a beautiful, clean interface to help get you where you need to go.

### Uplift | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/uplift-cornell-fitness/id1439374374)

Staying fit at Cornell is easier than ever! With Uplift, you can:

- Check gym hours and occupancy

- Explore fitness classes and add them to your calendar

- Bookmark your favorite classes to stay updated


### Pollo | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pollo-polling-made-easy/id1355507891)

Ask questions and take live polls with the click of a button. Through Pollo’s simple, easy to use interface, you are able to ask your audience questions and receive live feedback, whether you know them or not, to make faster decisions and better gauge their understanding

&amp;nbsp;

In addition to our apps, we also host [CourseGrab](https://coursegrab.cornellappdev.com/). CourseGrab notifies you when a course you wants opens up during enrollment.

&amp;nbsp;

---
# Courses

Cornell AppDev teaches three^(possibly four next semester, no promises) courses each semester. 

Each course is taught by our core team members and can be taken for 2 S/U credits. Requirements include attending a 1-hour lecture once a week and completing a weekly project, culminating in a final project at the end of the semester for our Hack Challenge. We currently offer three courses (iOS development, backend development, and product design) that have been taken by hundreds of students at Cornell. The courses are a great starting point if you are interested in joining AppDev and want to gain experience. 

&amp;nbsp;

---

# Applications 

Core Team and Course applications are available at the beginning of each semester. You may apply to multiple Core Team positions and courses if you would like. 

&amp;nbsp;

That's it about us! Feel free to ask questions about the core team, the courses, or our apps."

We're a team of mental health passionate people who are all recently out of college, and we're looking to get input from Cornell students (we're designing the app specifically for college students) on the concept and the app. We're still in beta so would appreciate y'all signingup and giving us feedback!

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/books/philosophy/Natural_selection.pdf

3) biology is not a science

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/Bbiology-is-not-a-science.pdf

3) biologists dont know what a species is-thus theory of evolution is nonsense

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/BIOLOGISTS-DON.pdf

all very simple and clear

the facts are

1) 1 is a finite number it stops

A finite decimal is one that stops, like 0.157

A non-finite decimal like 0.999... does not stop

when a finite number 1 = a non-finite number 0.999.. then maths ends in contradiction

another way

1 is an integer a whole number

0.888... is a non-integer it is not a whole number

0.999... is a non-integer not a whole number

when a integer 1 =a non-integer 0.999... maths ends in contradiction

2)1)Darwins book is called On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection ....

but

this paper shows natural selection is not the origin of new species Natural selection is not the origin of new species

Natural selection does not generate new genes/species Natural selection adds no new genetic information as it only deals with the passing on of genes/traits already present and it will be pointed out genetics cannot account for

the generation of new species/genes as it is claimed the generation of new genes [via mutation] is a random process due to radiation, viruses, chemicals etc and genetic cannot account for these process happening as they are out side the scope of genetics physics, chaos theory etc may give some explanation but genetics cant

2) Biologist cant tell us what a species is -without contradiction thus evolution theory ie evolving species is nonsense

Biologists agree there is species hybridization

but that contradicts what a species is

3) biologist tell us they investigate life

but

they cant tell us what life is-they can tell us what life does but cant tell us what life is they cant even give a definition of life that is not nonsense"

However, my undergraduate GPA at Cornell University is 2.72 due to these major life events.

During the spring semester of my freshman year, my backpack got stolen, which drastically affected my mental health and caused me to drop out of my introductory CS course. As for the fall semester of sophomore year, I was dealing with anxiety and undiagnosed ADHD and ended up with a D in linear algebra due to a combination of factors that I don't feel comfortable mentioning in Reddit.

I ended up taking a year off of university, which is why I have many W's on my transcript for the Spring 2018 semester but I came back to get a B+ in web programming and a B- in linear algebra as well as a C+ in discrete mathematics. Gosh, I wish my GPA was better when I came back from my year long leave of absence but it is what it is.

Currently, I'm taking Networks, Introduction to Learning Analytics (a graduate level course), Independent Reading and Research, Object Oriented Programming and Data Structures, and Engineering Probability and Statistics II. So far, I'm doing okay on these courses except for Networks and OOP and DS. I will try my best to bring up my grades for the last two years of my undergraduate career, especially that I did poorly in the first two years (except for freshman fall) in my subjects.

My ultimate goal with doing a PhD in Information Science or a related field is to do industry research in technology (I will be more detailed once I have the time to concentrate on my life goals and not grind on my problem sets.) Knowing that I love my research at the Future of Learning Lab, which I did for three months, as well as my research at the Social Dynamics Lab in which I am conducting research about mental health and self-help subreddits, I want to conduct my original research in these following areas (but are not limited to): a more inclusive book recommendation system that isn't Goodreads and features authors of different backgrounds rather than just the most popular reads, the perceptions of Western media vs. local media in the drug war in the Philippines using natural language processing and neural networks, and a website or a mobile app that helps people with executive function (e.g. ADHD, autism, executive function disorder) using machine learning and natural language processing.

Anyway, I'm confused how to get into graduate school. I was thinking of taking a year or two off to enter the workforce as a data scientist at a company and then go back into graduate school.

I just applied early decision and was pretty sure of my decision until I found the unfortunate events that occurred around yesterday in my news feed. I really don't want to feel like I made a mistake, and I'm curious about how mental health is at Cornell. From what I read on Reddit, I've seen that the whole ""suicide"" stuff is overblown.

Biography: Julia Feliz Brueck is a mom to two boys and a vegan since 2008. Her education and professional background is in the fields of science and research, and she also holds two diplomas in art illustration. Julia is also a published author and illustrator within magazines and books, including the first ever vegan-themed board book for babies and toddlers, Libby Finds Vegan Sanctuary.

From her medium biography: An ethical vegan since 2008, Julia is a published author and illustrator, as well as scientific researcher. She is also the founder of sanctuarypublishers.com


Tldr - Julia feliz in her own words refers to herself as a “she”. The whole pronoun they/them, for her is a sham and it, perhaps, undermines a real issue for those who identify that way. SA should retract their statement. Daily sun should present both sides. That is all."

&amp;#x200B;

I will reference this article for the purposes of this post, seeing as it's the first article that comes up on google search.

[https://nypost.com/2019/10/28/missing-cornell-student-found-dead-after-leaving-frat-event/](https://nypost.com/2019/10/28/missing-cornell-student-found-dead-after-leaving-frat-event/)

The article states the following, which is the same information as most other articles on the matter: 

\&gt; The night before he vanished, the college freshman had dinner with his mother, then went to a frat event, [the Miami Herald reported](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/coconut-grove/article236702618.html).

\&gt; He was last seen leaving the Phi Kappa Psi house around 9:30 p.m. but had not been heard from after the gathering, police said.

\&gt; Campus police reported that they found his body Saturday afternoon at the base of Fall Creek gorge.

&amp;#x200B;

Notice the second sentence I quoted, which states he was last seen leaving the Phi Kappa Psi house. 

\#The missing detail is that the frat event was a dirty rush event being held at the nearby City of Ithaca Cemetery, not the Phi Kappa Psi House. He was most likely not last seen as the Phi Kappa Psi house, but rather at the cemetery at the frat event.

[Note that the cemetery is right by Phi Kappa Psi](https://preview.redd.it/nxqfjvd5pdv31.png?width=1522&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74850aad7642c61790e251314bd5aeedf4080303)

I do not have hard evidence to convince anyone of this, but I learned that these were the true circumstances of that frat event by word of mouth. I am not absolutely sure that my claims are correct, but since I believe there is a possibility they are correct, it is worthwhile to explore them, since perhaps we will uncover the truth about the incident, and learn how to prevent this from happening. If this incident did partly stem from a frat holding a dirty rush event at the cemetery, then I hope we learn from this and work to eliminate those events to any degree.  

I hope you talk about this post to me, to your friends, to anyone else. I hope we create conversation about this and work to get to the bottom of this tragedy. I hope the frat faces chooses to be punished for what might have been a terrible choice of event, so that all frats and the university can learn to never host events like that again. I hope there is a change made so that this does not happen again. 

If anyone has any supporting details or questions, please comment below. Thank you."

The 3000 level course is called Behavioral Economics and Public Policy while the 4000 level course is just called Behavioral Economics (but I suspect will also include public policy in its material) Is it okay to take both or is that redundant.

&gt;The night before he vanished, the college freshman had dinner with his mother, then went to a frat event, the Miami Herald reported.  
&gt;  
&gt;*He was last seen leaving the Phi Kappa Psi house* around 9:30 p.m. but had not been heard from after the gathering, police said.

Most articles give the same information, but I contend that this information is incorrect, but I do not have absolutely concrete evidence.

I heard from someone that Phi Kappa Psi was holding a dirty rush event not at their house, but at the nearby City of Ithaca Cemetery. I don't have the means to investigate this claim any further, but perhaps someone who hears about this post might. 

If it were true that the event had been held at the cemetery and not the house, Phi Kappa Psi would not want to reveal this information, because they would have to face the repercussions of holding a dirty rush event, and especially of holding one in such a place.

This change of locations might seem like a minor change of details, but this change in details could have meant the difference between life and death, but I am not able to make any certain claim.

I do not know what was happening at the event, and I do not know whether Antonio left from the cemetery or from the house to return back to North Campus, but I believe that by revealing this information, we might discover something about the dangers of holding dirty rush events at cemeteries, or dirty rush events outdoors, or dirty rush events at all, and maybe frats will learn from this and no longer hold these sort of events, or maybe Cornell will crack down on these events much harder.

Comment below if you have any details contributing to my account, or if you disagree with anything I have said. Talk to your friends about this, and try to get Phi Kappa Psi to reveal the true nature of the event they were holding that night. Even if it means punishment for them, that should be a small price to pay to lower the risk of such a tragedy happening to another student.

Thank you for reading through this."

It’s just uncomfortable, and doesn’t the other person on the phone line judge you when they hear your echoey voice or a flush sound in the background?! Maybe I have this wrong, and there’s a cultural norm somewhere in this word I need to go educate myself on... 

I’m not saying don’t ever go to the restroom with your phone. I get it. Some people sneak in a quick text or watch a short video to pass the time (and you can’t deny it, there are enough studies out there to say men do it). But a full fledged phone conversation? Really?!

I can't speak for those who want to seriously pursue a UI/UX career, but this class has taught me absolutely nothing, despite the 5 hours I've spent on those extremely boring lectures every week and the crazy amount of time I've spent on the group projects. There are five huge group projects (I'm not even gonna start on how insane the workload is for each one) throughout the semester and each is built on top of the previous ones, yet we never receive feedback on the one we just submitted before having to start working on the next one. What if we made a mistake there? According to Professor Leshed, you'll just have to carry those into your next assignment without knowing it. Sucks to be you, lol.

Even though we have never practiced many of the things we are asked to do in the projects (or receive feedback on those that we do), there have never been clear instructions from Leshed. There has also never been consistent grading among the TAs — and I don't just mean subjective opinions on whether a design idea is good or not, but things like ""should we take points off of this group because they didn't do more than what's recommended on the assignment handout."" When a student asked Leshed to release the grading rubrics, she claimed that doing so will lead students to just focus on ""checking the boxes"" instead of learning. Well, how are we supposed to learn when all our energy is spent on trying to figure out what you guys like and not losing points over ridiculously small things that absolutely don't matter, instead of actually taking our time to perfect our work?

And the fact that a ton of clarifications on the assignments is not made until someone asks about it \*on Piazza\* is even more telling. I'm a senior now and I've never had a professor — good ones and mediocre ones alike — who requires students to look at anything other than the official assignment handout/descriptions to find all the information they need to complete the assignment. Yet Leshed claims that ""it's your responsibility to check Piazza and be on top of the instructions posted there."" Well, isn't it YOUR responsibility as an instructor to make sure the instructions are clear in the first place? And if you made a clarification, shouldn't it be YOUR responsibility to make sure all your students see it? 

And this brings me to another point - how Leshed is oftentimes confrontational and standoff-ish when facing questions from students. I've heard from multiple friends in the class that when they simply asked about something from the lectures, her answers are always vague and sometimes even rude: ""If you paid attention in the lecture, you'd know."" Well I guess those students are just not smart enough for her liking then? And whenever someone questions the small window between two group project dues or inconsistent grading or other issues regarding how this class is organized, she's always like ""this is how things are always done"" and even blames the students for not trying in many cases.

I've been waiting for putting this all in the mid-term evaluations for this class but it doesn't seem like that's going to happen. So I'm leaving this here and hopefully this will be helpful for those of you still shopping for classes. COMM/INFO 3450 is without a doubt THE worst class I've taken at Cornell, and trust me, I've taken a lot of bad ones. I don't hold any grudge against Professor Leshed as a person, but I doubt that she is competent and receptive enough as an instructor to lead such a large and intense course. And if you don't want to make your life hard, avoid this class at all costs."

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I'm in my first semester of college and I'm shopping around for universities I want to transfer to after my two years. As of right now, assuming I get at least a 3.2 GPA I'm guaranteed acceptance into Stony Brook University for Computer Science. SBU is great, but without a doubt is Cornell better.

&amp;#x200B;

To keep it short: assuming I finish with a 4.0, is it possible for me to transfer into Cornell for CS? And if so, does this university offer a joint admission program like Stony Brook does?

Thanks."

However, something interesting happened when I went to take one of Happy Dave's mints. I always plunge my hand deep into the bowl to grab a mint from the bottom (because I'm sort of germaphobic), but this time I felt something strange. I grabbed onto it and tried to pull my hand out, but it turns out that what I had grasped onto was a handle. To my surprise, a hatch opened up beneath me, and I fell into the dark depths of Okenshields.

I awoke on a conveyor belt, passing through a series of unfamiliar, dimly lit rooms. In one I saw Happy Dave cutting the heads off of marshmallow Peeps and neatly stacking them in a pile on the table in front of him. Another room appeared to contain an exact replica of the stir fry station, except instead of stir fry, the wok was filled entirely with marbles. I saw the dark figure of a man stirring them constantly, which didn't do any favors to my throbbing headache. In yet another room, Happy Dave was... wait... wasn't he in that other room already? Confused, I rubbed my eyes. Sure enough, it was Happy Dave, except now he was running around an empty room, pretending to chase down students whose meal swipes didn't go through. After a few more rooms, I began to question my sanity, as every single room contained Happy Dave doing some activity. I passed by Happy Dave beating a live salmon with a pair of tongs as it struggled and thrashed about. Then I passed by him attempting to find the best possible combination of soda water and Bubly at a drink fountain. In one room, he was simply scribbling on a chalkboard with a half-molten popsicle. Finally, I noticed that the light in front of me was getting brighter. Shielding my eyes from the light, I began to hear a ringing sound, which gradually got louder. As if this weren't enough, I began to feel unbearably hot. Overwhelmed by sensation, I lost consciousness once again. 

After some amount of time, I awoke. I was in Okenshields, though evidently it had been closed for many hours. I was lying next to the dish return area; it seems as though I'd rolled off of the conveyor belt. Dazed, I got to my feet and stumbled to the exit. Although Okenshields was closed, Happy Dave was still standing at his station with a smile on his face. He didn't seem to notice me, which I was thankful for. I quickly slipped out of Okenshields, not sure what to make of my experience. I didn't grab a mint on the way out.

Anyway, just wondering if this has happened to anyone else. I don't know if I'm the weird one and this is a common occurrence here, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a bit unsettled by the entire thing."

This, and some other factors,basically sucked out all my love for learning and resulted in me having a shitty gpa (3.1) and hardly any internship experience. 

Fast forward to full time recruiting going on right now, and I've just been taking Ls. Not hearing back after resume drops, getting rejected after a phone interview, etc.. Almost to the point where I don't even want to try any longer. Just logging into handshake gives me severe anxiety. I'm now in a position where im graduating in a little over a month and dont have a job offer. idk wtf im gonna do or if theres even any decent jobs left at this point. My parents paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for me to attend this school and I just feel like a failure.

The place id be staying would be about the price of me living on campus next year (it’s a bit cheaper), but it’s a 12 month lease. It says you have to be a “registered student” for financial aid to apply to off-campus housing, so does financial aid still apply during the summer months when I’m not there?

Also how is this process for people in general? Is it a smooth process?

I’m planning to meet with financial aid/off campus living office but I’m just wondering what people’s experiences are in general with this stuff"

Is Boldt one of the nastier gothics on West, and is it mostly singles or doubles? Also, how difficult is it to get in since there are only 10 or so people per language? I'm assuming a lot of people apply but I have no idea how ""competitive"" (LOL) it is"

There is also enrollment information on most of the classes on the roster. Further information is provided below.

PHYS 2208: Priority is given to students who cannot satisfy their Physics requirement with PHYS 1102. If you cannot self-enroll in PHYS 2208 via Student Center, you should add yourself to the Physics [waitlist](https://www.physics.cornell.edu). If you only list one option for section and lab, you may be passed over for students who have been more flexible and listed more section options. Do not enroll in electives during lecture times.  If you need to add filler classes for financial aid purposes, do not add classes that meet during your requested section times. Your schedule will be reviewed to ensure spots you requested do not cause conflicts with classes in which you're already enrolled. Placements will be made in mid-December, directly through your college registrar. Due to the class having 38 separate components, it is not possible to give you your chances for enrollment to the class or a particular section. Most of the waitlist for 2207 was enrolled in their requested, or agreed upon, sections this semester.

PHYS 1112, 2213, 2214: There is no waitlist for this sequence and all seats in all sections have been released to Student Center. If you are flexible with your schedule you will be able to enroll.  If there are no open discussions or labs that fit your schedule, see the Physics Course Coordinator in 121 Clark Hall during your add/drop period. Sections will not be filled beyond capacity during the pre-enrollment period. 

PHYS 1116, 2217, &amp; 2218 are on the waitlist.

The swap feature works for Physics classes. If you are enrolled in a class and wish to change to a different open section, you can safely use the [swap](https://www.physics.cornell.edu/swap) feature without risk of dropping the class."

Lower stats are found at the hospitality school. I am currently applying with a 1350 SAT (with no subject tests), but hours upon hours upon working and volunteering experience. I also have a 3.6 GPA. My grades are A’s and B’s, and I am currently taking 3 AP classes: APES, AP Chemistry, and AP Calculus BC. I am on the Dean’s List for my high school, and was given an honor roll.

In addition, I have a recommendation from my company’s I work with, a CEO, a social media manager (for the hotel companies), and from a Cornell alumni.

My uncle went to the school, and my two cousins went here as well; with one of them attending the hospitality school.

One time when I caught him staring, I smiled at him- and he got this dear in the headlights look. At that point I was like either he likes me or I look like a dead relative, I couldn’t think of any other possible explanations.

So after a while I was like you know what, I’m tired of the speculation. Cuffing season is here and I thought he was kind of cute. So last week I said f it when I saw him the dining hall, wrote my name, number, and “text me” (per my friends’ advice) on a piece of paper and gave it to him in passing.

It’s been 4 days since this happened, and I have yet to receive a text. At this point I’m just perplexed- if he wasn’t interested then why on EARTH was he staring at me like that?"

The more time I've spent talking to people at Cornell and browsing this sub, the more I think that Let Them Eat Cake needs to be a real club. 

(Here is the link for those who didn't see my previous post)
https://reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/d894s0/new_club_idea_let_them_eat_cake/

There are not enough resources for Cornell students to abate their loneliness or stress from everything that happens here. While I thought of the club as something that specifically goes against the notion of exclusivity, I now think that it could focus more on inclusivity and making sure that there's a place for everyone.

Of course, everyone would still be welcome to come and enjoy cake (please do), but my hope is that all of the people who have felt or expressed loneliness here at Cornell could find solace through this club.

On that note, I would love to make this club a real thing, but I don't feel like I can do everything on my own. There's a fair amount of planning that would need to go into doing everything for this club. Would any of you guys be interested in helping me out?

Feel free to comment or message me if you might want to help out. I think that meeting as a group and figuring everything out would probably be the best way to take tangible steps towards making the club."

This morning, I got a PayPal notification that I received a transfer of almost $700 from an account called Cornell Family Donations. The only info attached to the account is an email address, Cornell.family.donations@gmail.com. I’m pretty sure it’s a scam because I couldn’t find anything through googling the name or email address. But my PayPal account has nothing but my personal email and name, so I’m not sure how anyone would get access and/or know that I go to Cornell. 

Anyway, I was just wondering if anyone else got a similar transfer or has any insight as to what I should do, I.e. return the money, contact PayPal, keep the money etc. Any advice is much appreciated!"

My memory isn't shit and my head feeling woozy was actually real. Why did this have to happen to me? Like why? I have to take care of my family and I tried my best to make it happen. Like granted I wasn't doing great but somehow I was able to maintain a 3.6 and get an internship at google. fuck this. fuck everything. I just needed to rant somewhere but I didn't wanna tell those around me cuz then they are gonna treat me differently. But I guess I'll lose my hair and might not show up in the spring and then they'll know. Don't pity me. There are probably others dealing with worse shit.

My first semester of freshman year didn't go too well and I ended up with a GPA below 2.0. I received a warning from CALS Student Services. Unfortunately, during the next semester, I passed most classes but received an F in one (CHEM 2080 smfh). This brought me below SAP standards again, and thus, I was put on academic and financial probation for this semester (Fall 2019). I was basically depressed and struggled in class and I failed to meet with CAPS or even reach out for much help academically throughout both semesters. I approached my first year with the mindset that I had to deal with everything on my own (that ended up being my downfall as I realize now I could've gotten help in different ways). I made sure to seek counseling once I got back home for the summer. 

I submitted an appeal for my financial aid eligibility over the summer and was granted the appeal under the condition that I'd be on financial probation for the Fall semester, and if I met SAP standards, I'd regain my financial aid for the spring semester. 

I feel that I have performed quite a bit better overall this semester and will likely attain a GPA above 2.0, however, I fear that I might earn an Unsatisfactory in one of my classes. If this occurs, I won't be in good academic standing and, as outlined in my appeal decision email from the Office of Financial Aid, I will not be eligible for financial aid during Spring or beyond until I am meeting cumulative SAP standards.

If this occurs, I will likely be required to take a semester (or semesters) off by CALS as I failed to meet my academic probation standards but not by far. My question is: if this were to occur, would I have the ability to appeal for my financial aid again? I come from a low-income family and I cannot afford to attend Cornell without financial aid. If I were to take a semester off, could I then appeal for my financial aid again after taking this break and gathering myself? I just want to make sure I didn't ruin my chances of continuing being a student here. It's really hard to focus on class with all of this pressure and anxiety over my head. I realize I messed up and it's probably for the better if I'm required to take a semester off, what scares me to death is the possibility that if I appeal for my financial aid eligibility, it won't go through since I already appealed once. Can anyone help? All opinions are appreciated."

The Labor Roundtable is an annual event that brings a wide range of representatives in labor leadership, unions, and social justice organizations to campus to engage in dynamic, in-depth conversations with students from all colleges. Through these discussions, students gain exposure to current trends in the labor movement and the fundamental role that it plays in bringing about social change.

While the event is hosted by ILR students, we encourage and welcome students of all majors who want to learn more about organized labor and the people who make it happen.

Here’s what happens. 

You don’t understand something and go to office hours to get help, but 10 other people got there before you, and you don’t have time to wait. You rush to the consultant office but no one is there —you forgot to check the pinned office-hour note on the Piazza. 

You are getting worried. 

You finally talk to someone and get the answer. You code furiously in the few hours you have between all the other things you have to do. As you code, you know you have errors, but you want to get everything finished before looking for errors. You know you are not following a sound programming methodology, but you don’t have time for all that methodology stuff and just want to get it done. 

At 6PM on the due date —you have to submit before midnight— you finally start testing and debugging. But there are errors and you can’t understand the output you get. You spend an hour studying the code, patching, running again, to no avail. 

You head for the consultant office. 

It’s a zoo, 

a gymnasium, 

with 30 people in the same boat, sweating and worrying, clamoring to talk to a consultant. 

You wait, very impatiently, looking over your code and commiserating with everyone else waiting. Finally, you talk to a consultant. You want them to tell you what your errors are. But that is not their job, they tell you! Their job is to help you debug, to give you suggestions for putting well annotated println statements in the program, for example. But you don’t have time for that. You’re frustrated, angry. 

This is not a good learning experience! You aren’t learning anything! You end up tired, frustrated, and mad at yourself and the course, having learned nothing.

It's Reddit, nothing wrong with sharing your opinion anonymously and getting support from others who feel the same. But then someone made a Piazza post that linked to the Reddit post, saying,

&gt;A lot of people feel this way. I would hope that their feedback influences the way this class is taught next fall. I encourage more constructive comments here from other students about how the course could be improved.

Imo this isn't a good thing to post on piazza - if you want to privately link the post to an instructor sure, but inviting open debate in what is supposed to be a resource for getting course help isn't the right move. But here's where it gets interesting: for some reason, the Networks piazza is set up so that a user can post in three ways: as themselves, ""anonymous to classmates"", or ""anonymous to everyone"". I'm not sure if the last option is truly anonymous (maybe the site owner can see authors or something), but now the piazza thread is an open forum with people shit-talking the class/professors under the protection of anonymity. At this time, the direct top-level responses are all saying this isn't constructive/this isn't the right place, but the responses to them are literally just Reddit-thread levels of goonery. I personally like the class but it's really not about that, it's about how the entire thing is just inappropriate to put on piazza, where I go to get legitimate help for the class. OP obviously knows about Reddit since they link to a Reddit thread - can't we just keep Reddit and piazza separate?

All I've got to say is...

I tried hanging out in the lounge of dorm, and meeting new people via classes and clubs but I feel very awkward and shy and sometimes I legit cannot articulate properly because I am so scared? And sometimes when they do agree to hang out with me, it is almost always me coming up with plans and I feel as if they hate me and I stop pursuing the one sided friendship. 

I honestly do not know what to do, and I hate how much time this anxiety is occupying from my schedule and how my productivity is increasingly declining because of this."

• Every morning, they leap out of bed, and stomp so hard on their way to the restroom that they must be either sprinting or doing burpees after every goddamn step.

• Despite being asked to tone it down multiple times, they refuse to stop, which shows that they won’t be discouraged by the h8rs.

So if you need an Olympian, come on down to Collegetown Plaza and please take these fucking A1 athletes somewhere with better athletic facilities to prepare for the 2020 Olympics."

Since Cornell has been getting increasingly more competitive to get into (10% admission rate for the of Class 2023) more students of a higher caliber are competiting against each other. This has an effect of highering the curve in some classes, specifically the intro classes and weed-out classes, where many students have already been exposed to the course. Although the instructor for classes can change and so does the mean (Example Weedout Course: Chem 2090 Marohn vs Abruna), this still fosters some sense of a harsher curve regardless of the intensity of the exam.

Some background about me: Was a transfer student. Didn't vibe well with my transfer unit/roommates but through Greek Life and a few clubs on campus, I've established a \~decent\~ network here. The only thing I feel bad about is the fact that I don't really have super tight friends. If you asked me who my 5 best friends were, only 1 one of them would be someone at Cornell (that too barely). 

These past few months haven't been great. Recruitment isn't going as well as I'd hoped, even though I prepped so hard over the summer for it. I'm not as down as I may seem, just because I understand jobs are competitive and I really am applying to places that most people only dream of working at. Nevertheless, all my friends are getting offers while I'm just stuck standing still. 

And because of recruitment, my social life has \*lowkey\* gone to sh\*\* - I haven't been going out all balancing my club duties, recruitment and schoolwork. On top of all that, due to some really inopportune texts within my group chats, I've found out what people in my club really think of me. Long story short: there's been tons of sh\*\* talking about me behind my back. It's gotten to the point where it's about 50-60% of the organization actively doing it. I tried asking the director about it but no one has given me an answer, apart from ""Oh I'm so sorry. I didn't actually mean what I said"" :| I hadn't noticed it at first, but I have not really been getting invites to parties with my ""close"" friends on campus either. 

At this point, idk what to do anymore. The things said about me aren't so much jokes but literal attacks (for lack of better word) on my hobbies/personality (think stuff like dressing style, general looks/appearance). Within my greek org, there's not a lot of scope for bonding anywhere in light of recent events

Has anyone ever dealt with this type of stuff before? I could use some advice on what to do with this roadblock.

p.s: When I first transferred, I'll admit I felt a little lonely but it didn't take long for me to quell those feelings. But this is the first time I ever felt like I'm not just valued anymore. I know its easy to say I could be blowing this out of proportion and it's just some random gossip but idk it just makes me feel like my life is being turned around. Feels bad man :("

No escape. It’s like we’re in a math notebook or something that’s been left on a shelf in a back corner somewhere. Nobody’s picked us up or calculated any Hermitian conjugates in a little while.

The Alliance for Science program is designed to “equip and empower emerging international leaders who are committed to advocating for science-based communications and access to scientific innovation in their home countries.”

Julia Feliz (who uses the plural pronouns “they” and “them”; we used “she” and “her” in the article title to avoid any grammatical confusion) [**wrote extensively**](https://medium.com/@jd.feliz/cornell-universitys-alliance-for-white-supremacy-50875412f058) about their predicament which began in early October, according to [***The Cornell Daily Sun***](https://cornellsun.com/2019/10/26/julia-feliz-says-that-cornell-was-racist-their-story-prompted-a-reply-from-president-pollack-a-student-led-rally-and-university-pushback/)*.* 

Feliz accused a visiting professor from Iowa State of using “racist and sexist terminology” and of “\[speaking\] loudly and walk\[ing\] towards them to intimidate them” after they asked a question.

As you can tell, I'm a senior in high school. From freshman through junior year, my grades were all A's with a total of 3 B's on my transcript. I worked pretty hard and I tried my best. My academics were my focus and I tried to take as many rigorous courses as I could. However, this year, my grades are slipping. It is NOT due to senioritis. I have gotten two major leadership roles this year (president of a club and major leadership role in JROTC), and I am taking 6 AP classes at the moment. I have never taken this many all in one year before. But because of that, I have 2 B's and a C right now. My B's are in AP Chem and AP calc, and my C is in AP Physics mechanics. I'm applying as a life science major and it is not physics-heavy at all so I know my strong suit does not need to be in physics. I applied to Cornell ED and I am worried that on the chance that I get in, all my hard work will have been for naught because of  my senior year transcript and they'll rescind my acceptance. 

Were any of you in my situation as a HS senior? Will this happen? Any help or info would be appreciated. My anxiety is just through the roof right now and I don't think my grades will change drastically. Also I'm sorry if these types of posts aren't allowed, I can delete them if need be."

At this point, I’m confused. Where is he going with this? Is it a metaphor for the limitations of what “exponentials can kill?” 

He goes on to tell us about how his wife gave him a plaque labeled “Stephen Strogatz: Over Explainer”. He was so proud. As he shed a tear, he unzipped his pants and sat the biggest penis I have ever seen right on the table at the front of the lecture hall. 

“I told you it was bigger than Trump’s.”

The room fell into silence. When he showed us the graphs of near-resonance frequencies of forced vibrations, no one ACTUALLY believed his dong was that big. Then everyone erupted in applause. I had never seen anything like it. 

Now, I’m reeling. I don’t know what to think of it all. My brain is in shock. I can’t process anything. I think I need to break up with my boyfriend because nothing will ever match what I saw on that lecture hall table today.

I hate it here. I am tired, burned out and have crippling depression. I didn't get out of bed for two weeks and everyone expected me to act like I was fine and do psets and prelims. It's so much harder to make friends here and people seem miserable and depressed. I was genuinely looking forward to becoming a software developer but Cornell has made me hate the idea of school. I'm a junior and every semester my grades have been in the shitter. I don't party, I don't go to club meetings anymore, I don't do sports, I don't have a job, I don't volunteer, I don't have anything to show for any semester I have been here except numerous all nighters spent in PSB followed by bombing prelims and massive student debt. 

Everyone is so self obsessed and the competition is toxic. People seem to do things for the sake of being seen doing them and because they are expected to do them. Today I watched my friend share about his internship offer and no one bothered to congratulate him. All that followed was a pathetic attempt to one up each other. Professors don't seem to care about a student's well being. They almost seem to be getting satisfaction from their classes/prelims breaking students. Why is depression so normalized here? I've heard students openly say they are very depressed and no one seems to bat an eye. It takes weeks to get an apt. with a mental health professional at Cornell health. 

There seems to be an overarching standard of measure for every action I take. I am tired of hearing bs from students threatening to drop a class for being one SD below a prelim mean, or breaking down because they didn't get a call back from goldman sachs after their HireVue. There seems to be no life in this place. Everything is just a prestige and numbers game. 

To top it all off, the mentality of ""if you don't like it, then leave"" seems to be everywhere. Emailed my prof about a bad grade on an assignment and he suggested dropping the class, talked to another professor about $450 books I can't afford and he suggested dropping the class, talked to a mental health professional about having mental breakdowns and he suggested skipping town, mentioned discomfort over offensive anti LGBTQ comments about my friend at a club and they suggested I walk away from the conversation. Is leaving the only option? 

I am tired of being tired, burned out and depressed. Every day of being here makes me feel like I don't have a life outside of Cornell to look forward to. I go back home and I have to be all smiles and have all these lunches with high schoolers and parents of kids who would give a kidney to go here. I have gotten to the point where I don't bother to sugar coat it. Cornell is a miserable place, the ivy league degree is very valuable but it comes at the cost of a person's mental health and identity outside of beinga cornellian. I talk to a lot of people daily and it's disgusting how the one thing I have continuously heard from freshmen and seniors alike is how they hate it here and can't wait to get out.

I was never really into Asian girls growing up (there weren't that many where I'm from) but I really got into anime and k-pop and high school and I love how Asian girls are a mix of cute/hot and it's just amazing. I know that the Asian population at Cornell is like &gt;20%, and I see a ton of really cute Asian chicks around campus and in my classes.

Unfortunately, I'm a pretty shy person, and everyone in my friend circle is white and I don't really have a way of breaking into an Asian friend circle. I also have never had a girlfriend in my life but everyone at home tells me that Asian girls love white guys but for some reason that doesn't hold for me... 

I'm really into the quiet, submissive type of girl that you see in those harem animes. I would totally kill to have a Japanese or Korean girlfriend. 

Do any Asian girls on Reddit want to be my girlfriend? (long shot I know). Or does anyone have tips? I'm not opposed to learning an Oriental language or learning to eat dogs and stuff if that appeals to Asian girls.

I've also just checked out of my schoolwork in general. I'm doing great in most classes but there's one CS class that I'm almost certain I'm failing. And granted, it's my fault that I didn't go to enough OH and basically getting below the mean on almost everything, but it gets hard to even get out of bed when you hate everything about your life. I've just started to take meds to let me go to sleep because I'd rather let the year pass than deal with this any more; I do the basic minimum and try to save my awful CS grade but that's it. I'm genuinely not good at CS, it was a tough road to maintain above a 3.0 gpa, but I'm a senior and it's too late to switch.

I’d like to brighten up the feed a little with some positivity for your Monday.

As we approach this break... please, PLEASE take care of yourself. Take this time to rest, relax, reset. Spend quality time with family and friends. Get as much sleep as your heavily deprived body can possibly handle. Don’t check your email for a day or two. Watch that show that’s been on your list for forever but you haven’t had time to start because you’ve had so much shit to do. Cuddle with some friends. Eat something sinfully healthy, and then eat some more of it. Go back for seconds, thirds at Thanksgiving dinner. Treat yourself to a shopping spree. Get a haircut, get new clothes, take a walk. DON’T let the misery and depression and anxiety and stress of this Godforsaken semester weigh on you during your time off. You DESERVE to be happy, and you deserve this break. We all do. We did it. We made it. 

When your life consists entirely of essays, problem sets, studying, all nighters, and exams... it’s quite easy to forget that that’s not ALL your life is. You matter to a lot of people, and the most important of those people is yourself. Take some you time, and come back ready to kick finals’ ass. You can do it. Though it always seems like you’re in competition with the rest of us here at Cornell, let’s see some collaboration. Let’s see some wholesome interactions. Let’s take care of each other. 

We made it. Take a deep breath and feel the light on your face. Congrats, you absolute badass. You did it."

Just seven minutes ago, I solved a spherical axially asymmetric Laplacian boundary value problem purely by inspection. 

Not only that, but I was also able to leverage the auditory hallucinations that I am now currently experiencing to my advantage by having them whisper the Laplacian operator in spherical, cylindrical, and toroidal coordinates, as well as the first 17 modified Neumann functions to me.

The books were packed in the backpack with care,

In hopes that freedom soon would be there;

Premed students were nestled all snug in their beds;

While visions of As on their prelims danced in their heads;

And hotelies in their leisure, and engineers in their depression,

Had just settled our brains for a long turkey session,

When out on the gorges there arose such a clatter,

I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.

Away to the window I dropped like my grades,

Saw crap undee the shutters and left the shit for my imaginary maids.

The moon on the construction of the new-fallen snow,

Gave a lustre of midday to objects below,

When what to my wondering eyes did appear,

But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny rein-deer,

With a little old driver so lively and alive,

I knew in a moment he must be David Gries.

More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,

And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:

""Now, A+! now, A! now A- and B+!

On, B! on, B-! on, C and C+!

To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!

Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!""

As leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,

When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;

So up to the dormtop the TAs they flew

With the sleigh full of toys, and David Gries too—

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the fly

The prancing and pawing of each little sigj.

As I drew in my head, and was turning around,

Down the chimney David Gries came with a bound.

He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,

And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;

A bundle of prelims and psets he had flung on his back,

And he looked like a pedler just opening his pack.

His eyes—how they twinkled! his dimples, how merry!

His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!

His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,

And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow;

The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,

And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath;

He had a broad face and a little round belly

That shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.

He was chubby yet hot, an alt-right jolly old elf,

And I fawned when I saw him, in spite of myself;

A wink of his eye and a twist of his head

Soon gave me to know I had something to dread;

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,

And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,

And laying his finger aside of his nose,

And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;

He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,

And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.

But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight—

“Fuck CS majors, you are going to get assblasted in Ithaca and at home!”"

I hope your break is off to a good start and that you've been able to ignore the pressures of academic life briefly. This year has been the first time that I've really felt overwhelmed at Cornell, and it's important we all take a mental break for the sake of our own sanity. If you're in the same spot, you're clearly not alone, and we're all gonna make it.

That being said, I am really struggling in CS 2800 and am unsure of my next move in my academic plan at this point. I'm a first semester sophomore in A&amp;S, and as of the last grade estimate released, I have a D in the class. I have an incredibly hard time doing the problem sets and have bad grades on many of them. I also scored around 50% on both prelims. My grades in all of my other classes are good, but I have trouble in 2800 specifically.

So far, these seem to be my options:

* Going all out on the final and hoping I get at least a C in the course
* Not getting at least a C in the course and becoming an Info Sci major
* Not getting at least a C in the course and retaking it (Will this affect graduation time?)

I really am passionate about CS and was always set on becoming a CS major, so if possible, that is the track I would like to stay on. My grade in this course is my own fault, but I am completely lost in terms of my resources to get help or who I can reach out to in order to move forward, and I would greatly appreciate any advice that anyone can provide."

It doesn’t make sense because I’ve found that the homework questions are almost always harder than the test questions. For example in CS classes the assignments might have a bunch of hard methods to write and will take like 10 hours, and the prelim will have much shorter and simpler questions in 90 minutes. I’ve noticed the same thing in math classes where the homework will have hard questions and the tests will be relatively straightforward in comparison. I always get like 50-70% on homework’s and then like 90% on tests because they’re easier.

I'm a high school senior and I'm applying to Cornell right now. Specifically, I'm looking to major in math, and I'm wondering if anyone here can tell me what they love about the math program, either undergrad or grad. What's special here, compared to MIT, CalTech, or Harvard? I tried looking up things on the school website, where I spent a good half hour, but despite the site's fantastic design aesthetic, my questions haven't really been answered, so I'd really appreciate your input.

On a similar note, how hard is it to test out of classes above Calc 1 and 2? For example, Multi, Linear, and Diffy Q's? How about Real Analysis or even Intro to Algebra (I know that's a bit of a stretch, but still)? 

\[Disclaimer\] I'm pretty sure that this question is specific and removed enough from a bare admissions question that I'm posting it outside of the megathread, especially since it's related to a particular program, but if I'm wrong then please do let me know and I'll fix it.

Heading back to Cornell University? We’ve got you covered. Read on for a detailed forecast of the winter weather.

OVERVIEW - Snow will develop tomorrow morning around 9-10 AM in Ithaca (earlier SW, later NE) becoming moderate/heavy at times before mixing with sleet/freezing rain midday tomorrow. A lull is expected mid/late tomorrow afternoon before heavy snow returns tomorrow night. Moderate/heavy snow will continue through the day on Monday before tapering off Monday evening. The graph in the first image gives a good general idea of what to expect hour-by-hour in Ithaca in terms of precipitation intensity (top precip bar), and type (the next four bars).

TODAY 11/30/19 there is *no* snow expected. If you are travelling today from anywhere on the East Coast, or can rearrange your plans to travel this afternoon, you will not experience any interruptions as high clouds slowly spill into the northeast.

TOMORROW MORNING (6-10 AM 12/1/19) snow will be moving into the area from the southwest. If you have an early flight from Detroit, it may be delayed but SW Michigan is expecting mostly rain, so you should be able to get out. This also applies to early flights from DC. (See Image 2)

TOMORROW MORNING (6-10 AM) if you're driving through Pennsylvania, be extremely careful as roads will be covered in ice due to freezing rain. Interstates should be ok as road crews apply salt to keep surfaces wet, but back roads may be very slippery. Allow extra time to get here! (See Image 3)

TOMORROW MORNING (6-10 AM) if you're driving in from the west (Buffalo, Ohio, etc.) expect rain until you get to the PA/NY border, then precipitation will change over to a mix of ice/sleet/snow. Allow plenty of extra time to get here as you'll need to take it slow

TOMORROW MORNING (6-10 AM) if you're driving in from the east (NYC, Boston, etc.) expect dry conditions until 8-10 AM when a mix of snow and sleet will begin falling. If you can get to Ithaca by 10 AM, you should avoid substantial delays. (See Image 4)

MIDDAY TOMORROW (10 AM-2 PM), we'll see a burst of heavy snow and sleet here in Ithaca likely between 10 AM and 2 PM. If you're planning on arriving during this time, expect significant delays as traffic will be moving very slowly across the entire Central NY region. (See Image 5)

MIDDAY TOMORROW (10 AM-2 PM) if you're heading through SW NY (Buffalo, Jamestown, etc.) OR north through PA, you'll be moving quite slowly through heavy freezing rain/sleet. If you're heading south from ROC/SYR OR east from ALB, you'll be moving slowly through moderate/heavy snow.

MIDDAY TOMORROW (10 AM-2 PM) if you're flying into ITH/ROC/SYR, delays are likely and cancellations are possible given the onset of moderate/heavy snow and sleet.

TOMORROW AFTERNOON (2 PM-6 PM) snow/mixed precip will be tapering off to the west of Ithaca as drier air moves in aloft. If you're heading in from Buffalo or Ohio, you won't encounter much precipitation until you're into the Finger Lakes, but roads may still be slick. (See Image 6)

TOMORROW AFTERNOON (2 PM-6PM) heavy snow will be pivoting northeast of Ithaca, making travel very difficult if you're coming from NYC/CT/ALB/SYR. We strongly advise leaving as early as possible if you're travelling from these areas!

TOMORROW AFTERNOON (2 PM-6 PM) if you're flying into ITH/ROC/SYR, expect significant delays and/or cancellations as airport operations become heavily impacted by heavy snow. If you can make arrangements to get on an earlier flight, it would definitely be worth it!

TOMORROW EVENING (6 PM-10 PM) We'll see a bit of a lull in precipitation during this time as the storm hops over the Appalachian mountains and redevelops in New Jersey. Expect light freezing rain/sleet to switch over to light snow here in Ithaca while heavy snow falls ALB-BOS (See Image 7).

TOMORROW EVENING (6 PM-10 PM) If you're driving in from the west or south (Buffalo/OH/PA/NYC/etc.) you'll encounter only light precipitation, much of which will be rain or freezing rain until you get close to Ithaca. Roads may still be slick, but overall you should be OK.

TOMORROW EVENING (6 PM-10 PM) If you're driving in from the north (ROC/SYR) you'll encounter light to moderate snow which will make roads slick but not impassible. If you're willing to go slow, you should be fine driving during this time.

TOMORROW EVENING (6 PM-10 PM) If you're driving in from the east (ALB/BOS), you'll encounter very heavy snow and treacherous road conditions on I-90 and I-88. If it's at all possible, don't drive through here during this time! Snowfall rates will be &gt;2"" per hour

TOMORROW EVENING (6 PM-10 PM) If you have a flight into ITH/ROC/SYR during this time, you'll likely encounter some delays, but planes should be able to land after they clear off the snow from earlier in the afternoon.

TOMORROW NIGHT (10 PM-4 AM) Bands of heavy snow will develop again over the Ithaca area as the storm strengthens near NYC. If you're not here by midnight, it's probably best to wait until later in the day on Monday. Snow could fall at rates of 1-2"" per hour. (See Image Eight)

MONDAY MORNING (4 AM-10 AM) bands of moderate to heavy snow will remain over the Ithaca area as the storm remains more or less stationary near Long Island. Travel from the east or southeast (ALB/BOS/NYC/CT) will be extremely difficult while conditions will improve to the west. (See Image 9)

MONDAY MORNING (4 AM-10 AM) if you're flying into ITH/ROC/SYR, expect significant delays and/or cancellations as heavy snow will be a challenge for airport crews to keep up with. If you can get on a flight tomorrow AM, that would be ideal but otherwise, your best bet is Tuesday

MONDAY MIDDAY/AFTERNOON (10 AM-6 PM) moderate snow will continue through the day on Monday from Ithaca east into New England. Travel from the west will improve, but roads east of Ithaca will remain treacherous as heavy snow continues to fall in eastern NY/New England. (See Image 10)

MONDAY EVENING (6 PM-10 PM) snow will taper off as NW winds bring drier air into the region and the storm moves into the Gulf of Maine. Roads will remain hazardous to the east of Ithaca, but you should be ok if you're heading in from Buffalo or points SW.
(See Image 11)

FINAL THOUGHTS - The earlier you can get here today/tomorrow morning, the better. Be ready to take it slow and expect delays no matter where you're coming from. Make sure to give us a follow for the latest info over the next 48 hours. Be safe! -Jack Sillin and Aidan Mahoney"

If you are interested: 

Firstly, thank you for offering to help test iris!

Currently there are no real people in the system and you will not receive any recommendations/matches. At this stage you can only register and train iris re: what you find attractive. Real soon we will be releasing the full version and you will be able to see real recommendations!

**1. Open this link** on mobile to download the app. If you run the app and it asks for an invite code, click this link again.  
[https://bi.irisdating.com/Beta1](https://bi.irisdating.com/Beta1)

**2. Sign up** and go through training iris

**3. Please leave your feedback** at the link below. We really need your thoughts and comments, this is the most important part!  
[https://forms.gle/hcuWVYSxqvp5TSDr6](https://forms.gle/hcuWVYSxqvp5TSDr6)

If you would like to go through training again (for some people it works better 2nd time), from your profile click **settings** and **delete your profile**. Then **delete the app** and repeat from step 1.

I know the argument is normally that admins could make more in the private sector hence the higher pay but I would argue that universities are unique enterprises that don't follow typical market rules. First, they have a more or less captive market and, more importantly, are governed by moral not just financial motives. This is why they're considerd non-profits. Reduce administrative bloat, and you take a big step toward solving a number of so-called ""crises"" in academia.

Plus, you'd see a much wider range of disciplinary representation (not just STEM and law) at the helm of universities. And you just know a philosopher would cancel at the drop of a hat for a snow day."

I forgive whoever I may offend with this post, but my tastebuds can take the abuse no longer. 

Over the course of my life thus far, I have had over 20 years of experience tasting all sorts of chicken wings from all kinds of different restaurants, including but not limited to Buffalo Wild Wings, Wingstop, Wings over Ithaca, various pizza parlors, and Nasties. So you can say that my taste in chicken wings is perhaps one of the most refined there is. I therefore believe that I am qualified to testify on behalf of the university on the quality of West Campus’ chicken wings.

It appears to me that West Campus serves two types of chicken wings:

1. The good kind.
2. The bad kind.

It seems that the type of wings served on West alternates every day, completely irrespective of dining hall. I have had both types of wings in Cook, Bethe, Keeton, and Rose. 

Today’s wings, served in Bethe, were the bad kind. They were over-seasoned, excessively fatty and greasy, and devoid of all chicken-like taste. 

These type of wings are so over-seasoned that I can predict with 100% accuracy which type of wings (type one or two) are served in the dining hall on any given day just by walking in and sniffing the air. 

The wings served yesterday in Keeton, however, were the good kind. They were crispy, but not too crispy, and of quality taste. I place them on a pedestal above Wings Over Ithaca, but below Buffalo Wild Wings and Wingstop. They are of perfect quality for a university ranked 3rd in the US for campus food. 

The wings today, however, don’t even make the list and are so awful that Cornell should drop at least 10 ranks in the list of universities with the best dining hall food. 

I implore all of you to help me find a way to help rectify this wing situation so that we may all enjoy tasteful chicken wings on West on any given day. 

Thank you."

Everything is beautiful

This is my fourth winter in Ithaca, and the fourth winter of my life. I love it.

People get together to go outside and play. Not on their phones. Interacting with other people. You can’t keep your phone out for too long or your fingers will freeze! Cold weather forces people to interact with each other more which makes existing around Cornell and Ithaca that much better. People are willing to be social instead of just so hyper focused on work and grades.

People have fun, play games, and interact with nature and the world and people and architecture around them. The snow connects people. I don’t see this happening during the spring/summer/fall nearly as much.

I wish we had more of it.

Best part: it’s only just begun for this year. Get your sleds ready because we are in for some great times over the next few months!"

I've started to think I might want to major in AEP, and I have a few questions about it:

1. Are there classes I can take that give me a good feel for what AEP is like in general?
2. Sort of going off the first question, is ENGRI 1200 (Nanoengineering) a good introduction for AEP, being an AEP course? I ask mainly bc the course description states that the spring semester version of the course is more focused on biotechnology, and I was wondering if this focus made it any less focused on physics.
3. How is the freedom in courses in AEP? As in, how possible is it to take a good number of courses in other fields that I'm interested in?

Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks !!"

I like libraries. It's like this humongous collection of summaries of great people's life's works over hundreds, thousands of years. How wonderful does that sound. We won't get to know all of it. I was so sad when we had to choose our streams in grade 11 because I'll never know what studying microeconomics or geology is like, not in a classroom environment. We had this TV show on Nickelodeon where some dudes did some work in a workshop, and I have dreamt so many times of all the wonderful things I could do in there, of all the innovations that I could come up with, of how it's going to make life a little better for some people. I was going to choose the conventional Joint Entrance Examination path like every other High schooler in India and then I stumbled across Glorious to View, and my childhood self was like Holy shit these places actually exist! I scored terribly in class 11 because I was too enchanted by the wonderful world of CS courses on Coursera. I scored low on the SAT despite topping my maths class in school because they cut 90 marks for like 4 wrong questions in Math. I obviously don't like to think of it but deep down I know so well I'm not getting to go there. Missing out on not the academics but a community of higher thinkers, a group who's as imperfect and motivated and curious as I am. I've missed out on a lot of things in life, but this is a little different. The mods are gonna remove this for being antagonistic anyway. But to everyone who's in that place, busy being a God, and everyone who's on the other side of the fence, just trying to survive, I hope you do yourself proud, more than anyone else. The difference we seek for can come in a plethora of ways and methods. A Cornell education is just one of them. There's something in those gorges, something about that remote location, something humble about the air in that place. Something that invites you to dance. Something that beckons you to explore, something that tingles your curiosity to make you dig deeper and strive harder. I like that feeling. Ah, I'm romanticising this once again.

In short, I haven’t attended a single class or done any work since the end of the first prelims. A combination of physical and mental health issues that were snowballing since senior year high school, combined with family issues and complete social isolation, brought me to the point where I was missing classes and struggling to stay emotionally stable enough to seek help from CAPS. One bad therapy session sort of tipped me into breaking and I haven’t been to classes, done work, or spoken in person to anyone since. I can’t believe so much time has passed so fast. Nobody ever noticed I was gone and I never received any emails or texts or even notifications on Canvas about grades or my absence, and although that’s something I should have expected with the freedom and vastness of college it only made me feel worse.

Somehow finals are only a week away, and it’s probably impossible to salvage any of my classes. I have not registered for spring classes yet either, and I wouldn’t know how I could possibly fare in them without knowing most of what was taught in the prerequisite classes I took this semester. From what I’ve found searching here, I can expect to be put on a leave of absence for a semester? I’m not sure, but I desperately do not want to go back home, and I’m afraid it’ll only make things worse to have to stay there when family was such a big part of the problem in the first place.

I felt so lethargic and depressed I literally did nothing most days, and it took a lot of effort to send the few early emails I did manage to send, which didn’t really go very far.

I am a graduate PhD student in the Hotel School and witnessed an assault by Ankur Mulji on an undergrad last night.

Ankur approached an undergraduate student and harassed the individual with threats on a sidewalk as the undergraduate student was waiting for the bus, and continuously stating that the individual ""does not belong at Cornell because he/she is an undergraduate student"". Ankur also continued his verbal assault, stating that ""undergraduates are scum and do not have any jobs when they graduate Cornell"" and other racial slurs directed towards the student's home country, and that he himself is part of the ""prestigious Baker Program, and will make sure the [undergraduate student] will have an awful time at Cornell"". Ankur then continued to attempt to physically intimidate the undergraduate student by standing right against the student's physical body, physically slapping the undergraduate student's chest, and stated that he will follow the student onto the bus when the student explicitly told Ankur ""to get away"". Ankur only stopped when the student stated that he/she will call the police if the behavior does not stop, and Ankur walked away saying that ""[the student] made a mistake, and he (Ankur) will be seeing the student real soon"". All of these assaults and threats were because the undergraduate student was merely waiting for a night time bus on the sidewalk, as Ankur pushed past the student, only to turn around to tell the student to ""move the fuck off the sidewalk"".

This conduct by a graduate student clearly indicates a distinct pattern from Ankur of hatred towards undergraduate students, which is completely unacceptable as Cornell now host nearly 15,000 undergraduate students during the school year. The physical and verbal threats for harm is completely unacceptable from graduate students, especially as they are often times a lot older and stronger than undergraduates that just entered college. I also believe Cornell shouldn't allow this type of behavior at all from graduate students or permit the acceptance and existence of these types of graduate students, whom do not intend to ""share"" the campus with undergraduates, as this erodes from the ""Cornell Community"" that we all sought to build here on campus. This feeling of graduate superiority, egotism, and hate should not exist on our campus, to the point of nearly a hate crime, as it specifically targets undergraduate students."

I'm currently a junior here who is struggling with depression and SAD. Given that Ithaca is known for its bad weather, this has really affected my SAD to the extent that I can't even concentrate on what I'm supposed to be doing. My grades aren't as good as a result of this. 

I'm not sure what to do at this point. I tried going to Cornell health but it doesn't help at all for me (been going since day 1). I have thought about transferring to schools with similar prestige to Cornell such as Duke (school prestige is EXTREMELY important for the industry that I hope to enter); however, given my grades (3.5-3.6 range in a supposedly ""easy"" major), I don't think a transfer to a school like Duke would even be possible at this point. Also, I def want to switch majors, which is not even possible at Cornell (Can't internal transfer to my desired school/major as a junior)

I don't hate Cornell. It's just that I can't cope with the environment/climate here.  If I stay here, I feel that I'm just wasting my college years not as productive as I can be. Do you guys think that transferring would be a good idea?

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts and perspectives would be greatly appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks! Hope everyone the best on their finals and happy holidays to everyone!!!"
e7goaw,Occupy Sage Hall: Time for Undergraduate Equality!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/e7goaw/occupy_sage_hall_time_for_undergraduate_equality/,OccupySageHall,1,2019-12-07 08:58:20,2,/r/Cornell/comments/e7goaw/occupy_sage_hall_time_for_undergraduate_equality/,NaN,"As many of you know, the college and the university has long treated undergraduate students like second class citizens, while allowing graduate students to have extra privileges to the point that many injustices against undergraduates have been perpetrated by those in the graduate program.

1) An undergraduate student was called the cops on by a graduate student because the undergraduate student was using the Breazzano Center past 5pm. This was covered up and prevented to be published on the Cornell Daily Sun by the SC Johnson administrators.

2) Just this week, an undergraduate student was assaulted by a graduate student claiming he was part of the Baker Program, and attempted to follow the undergraduate student after unwanted physical contact as intimidation tactics. Apparently, the graduate Baker Program student mentioned that undergrads don't get jobs out of Cornell to the student he assaulted.

3) Many of you already experienced constant harassment, intimidation, and belittling from graduate students for using the same resources on campus that undergraduate tuition subsidize! 

So here is a call to action: we are looking to occupy Sage Hall all throughout this week. Feel free to use it for ALL your study needs. It is time this administration gives equal rights to undergraduate students. But as always, be safe, if you see any further hate crimes targeted towards undergrads, REPORT!

Best,

With a new semester coming up, is a room switch possible? I’ve contacted Prof. Townsend for a room switch but have yet to get a response.

I currently reside in an apartment in collegetown (only like 3 mins away from Cornell, is new/modern). Since this apartment is part of the Ithaca Renting company, the leases are 12 months.

The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of loop invariants, most of the jokes will go over a typical listener's head. There's also Gries' nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterization - his personal philosophy draws heavily from JavaHyperText, for instance. The 2110 students understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly *appreciate* the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Gries truly ARE idiots- of course, they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humor in Gries' existential catchphrase ""I, Gries, have 58 years of programming experience"" which itself is a cryptic reference to the transcript of the ACM Turing Award Lecture delivered by Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1972, named *The Humble Programmer.* I'm smirking right now just *imagining* one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Gries' genius unfolds itself on their iPhone screens. What fools... how I *pity* them. 😂 And yes, by the way, I DO have a Gries tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand."

The online queue for office hours opens at 4:00 and sometimes there are 40+ people in the queue within 30 seconds of its opening. Trying to get help at lab isn't much better.

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my prelim, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to drop my prelim up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen prelims in his hands without grading them.

The head TA was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to grade these first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hearing him, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the TA.

When he took one of the prelims  and started grading the same question multiple times on other prelims, he stopped him and told him to grade them each individually “to keep the transaction O(n),” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s the most efficient running time.

I saw Austin Benson at Wegmans yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and complain about networks or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen lemons in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the lemons and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent an information cascade,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that could happen here. After she scanned each lemon and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by bragging about he knows her because of the small-world phenomenon"

Drunken obnoxiousness may initially be attributed to neurological imbalances caused by alcohol, which in turn lowers inhibitions and may cause the user to also be unaware of the decibels they are emitting. 

However, a physiological perspective on the behavior of drunken obnoxiousness is not a sufficient explanation of the behavior, as physiology does not explain the cognitive motive behind the actions displayed by these wasted individuals. 

Drunken obnoxiousness is thus a product of the inherent psychology of humans in their fear of the permanence of death, and is an effort to cry out to the world, ‘notice me’, in a desperate plea for recognition of their otherwise meaningless existence. 

In brief moments of intoxication humans are able to forget their social and civic responsibility. If thus becomes irrelevant if one is loud, because the needs of other people are secondary to quenching the thirst of love and belonging. Even the illusion that people are listening brings solace to the discontented hearts of some."

Just reading those posts I literally felt my heart was bleeding, because I was going through the exact same thing. Everyone here probably would have worked really hard to get into Cornell and it's really upsetting that we're all just struggling so much instead of enjoying what we've achieved. 

It's especially a hard time right now since there are no classes (less social interaction) and tons of final exams coming up, but please take care of yourselves. If you're depressed or emotionally distressed, don't bear it all yourself. I know it's not easy (I really know), but ask for help. Call CAPS and get counseling, call your friends, family members, actively reach out for help. 

I feel like I've rambled but I just wanted to say thanks for all the supportive comments when I posted those kind of posts here and to other people who are going through a hard time, YOU'RE NOT ALONE!

P.S. I don't know if it's against the rules to promote my song, so I won't unless the mods say it's okay."

So here’s the thing: I have a high IQ, like definitely over 95, and I find it hard to communicate with others. I know you probably won’t understand my plight, since you’re most certainly not as brainy as me, so let me expound (that means “explain”):

I often find that females are intimidated by my intelligence quotient. E.G. (“exempli grati”, from Old Norse), I tried to strike up a convo with the fine specimen at the Goldie’s checkout register. I attempted to demonstrate to her that genital length is directly proportional to IQ. I provided evidence for this claim, proving that I have 75 IQ points for every inch. I thought this would serve to impress her on two fronts: my large brain and my larger member. But instead of wooing her, it intimidated her poor, feeble mind. Not knowing what else to do, m’lady shoved me away from the counter. I landed on the ground, pants down, with my high intelligence dong in plain sight for the entire PSB atrium. Rather than being dazzled with my superiority, everyone simply laughed at me. Even Obama walked in and laughed. 

So this is my situation. No matter what I do, people always laugh at me because they can’t grasp my *intelligence*. Help please :("

The interaction that followed has to be the funniest thing I have experienced since I came to the US a few years ago.

* Naturally, I immediately showed up with my foreign ID (as an international student) that has worked in the past.
* The man behind the counter rejects my ID, requesting that I bring my passport.
* I try reasoning with him for \~30 seconds and realize I should take the L and go and get my passport because I really want Mint pods.
* I come back in a few minutes with my passport and ask for 2 packs of Mint pods.
* Note: the man behind the counter referred to everyone at Jason's as *his* staff, so I assume that he was none other than Mr. Jason himself.
* Jason, as he slides over the Mint pods: ""Thank you for that. But also, if you ever show that Arab ID in this store again, you will be permanently banned - a picture of you is going up behind the counter.  Tobacco products require a US, scannable ID.""
* Me: ""Excuse me? I'd like to understand why you just said that because that is insane. I don't want to carry around my passport around campus, and even if you wanted me to do that, why threaten me in such a hostile way? Just tell me nicely dude.""
* Jason: ""You are taking advantage of the system, and I cannot have that. What would happen if I went to your country and tried to buy a gun with my NY State ID?""
* Me: ""Well, Sir... We are not insane so we do not sell guns to the public.""
* \*silence\*
* Me: ""I feel pretty taken aback, are you discriminating against me because of my Arab ID?""
* Jason, at this point, has lost his shit: ""DISCRIMINATION??! Do you know what that word even means? You liberals just throw around that word! Tell me, what does discrimination mean? Now I'm offended!""
* At this moment, I am having the time of my life, but I also really really want those Mint Juul pods.
* Me: ""Just between me and you, Sir. I am not a liberal, I would absolutely *love* four more years of Trump.""
* Jason: ""Well, then, we are friends. You are a good man. I like you and your willingness to talk, I like your country too, you must be a student of finance!""
* Jason slides over the mint pods and swipes my card. We shake hands.
* I leave, satisfied with a Minty Juul. But at what cost?"

A: Getting a 4.0 isn’t necessarily difficult because it’s hard to get A’s. It’s difficult because it’s hard to never get below an A. Just one unfortunate midterm or final over 4 years can ruin your perfect GPA.

Don’t worry about not being able to get a 4.0, we’re at Berkeley not some shmuck Ivy League private school where you pay for one when you pay for tuition."

This is our historic, once in a generation shot, and it runs through getting every single vote in NH. We will probably target several towns where the margin of victory over Hillary was a few as 30 votes. And unlike getting into unproductive arguments on Twitter, Facebook, or obscure subreddits, canvassing actually works! 

If it sounds sort of scary to talk to people, just know people are also way friendlier and open IRL than over the phone or internet, and you don't need to know everything about Bernie's policies to help!

The receptionist was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Excuse me, you need to actually accomplish something useful before putting your positions on your resumes.” At first they kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and went over to her. 

When she pulled out a calendar to schedule a meeting for them to discuss the creation of next semester’s schedule with Martha, they just took it and crossed out half of the final exam study days. “To keep the students less stressed,” they said, and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t think that’s how it works.

When applying, I was on the fence between applying to Engineering or Arts and Sciences. I decided to apply to CoE for Engineering Physics.

Since applying, I've only regretted my decision more and more. I wish I had applied to CAS because I love the theoretical and philosophical part of physics the most and want to have the flexibility to take loads of classes in philosophy, history, mathematics, classics, astronomy etc. Looking through the course catalog,90% of the courses that I most want to take are in Arts and Sciences, not Engineering.

Question 1: How difficult is transferring into CAS once I get to Cornell, and how soon can I transfer?

Question 2: Is it possible to switch to CAS before I even step foot on campus? Who would be the best person or office to contact to ask about this?

Question 3: Should I even be concerned about transferring? Do I have any wrong impressions?"

Why can't you advocate for students on the most basic of topics and act as an objective committee of oversight?

Let's start with the activity fee. A price hike on that, really? The cost hike itself isn't as problematic as the fact as there was no dissent--I'll bet that plenty of students would dissent to a price hike, especially in light of the tuition hike. It's disappointing that stuff like this just flies right on through as if it's trivial.

The whole issue with the Alliance for Science is incredibly disturbing too. SA immediately falls in line to support Julia Feliz when it's obvious that the details of what happened are not clear. Fellows within the program, from their respective Asian and African countries, pushed back against Feliz's allegations of discrimination and offered a very different perspective of what happened. Yet, the views of these individuals were effectively ignored in favor of confirmation bias and what SA deemed to be the ""truth"". They rushed through the vote of condemnation without even investigating what actually happened.

I was taken aback and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off saying I’d forgotten to draw some circuit diagrams and holding schematics in front of my face. I walked away and continued about my business, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off.

When I went to the receptionist to declare my major, I saw him walking out the door with like 50 Arduinos in his hands. The receptionist was very nice and professional, and was like “Excuse me, those are for the labs, you can’t just take those” At first he pretended to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and just plopped them all on her desk.

When she asked him what he was doing he just kept telling her to check her circuit and debug her inferior brain. Then when she picked them up to put them back, he told her to walk low to the floor so she wouldn’t introduce a parasitic capacitance into her system and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s how that works.

Whenever she would stand up straight again, he would make this obnoxious ringing noise with his mouth, and he kept doing it all the way down the stairs.

Only a bunch of fools would let the students make any sort of meaningful decision (schedule, admin fees, etc.) by fools like the students. It is far too likely that the SA is a scapegoat organization that can be used to push these agendas without any backlash – they can just point back at the student body and say that we elected the SA. 

Even if there was a ""real"" vote on such decisions, there had to have been influence (direct or indirect) from the administration. Most people already are aware of the fishy circumstances regarding elections here, as we can recall candidates in the past being disqualified for reasons that to this day remain ambiguous. If I were a betting person (I'm not), I would place a good deal of cash on designating student elections as bullshit as the student assembly's role in making legitimate decisions. Remember when free printing began in October? Me neither. 

That's because the school realized it *cost money*, so rather than directly saying ""no"" after an approval was prematurely made, the administration launched a succession of committees, meetings, and other bureaucratic requirements designed to do nothing but slow the process down. Just wait until next semester, when it gets delayed again.

There are actually a fair number of probable ulterior reasons for a final exam schedule change (such as higher internship/job ranking, etc). Some bad ones are related to rush week, and reducing (HA!) the stress the final exam period puts the students. In fact, just about every other shit reason like this is listed in the well-known decision report, which is but another sad byproduct of the business-like, bureaucratic-based system that this place has running. Over 100 page report of what? Whoever got paid to write that was probably giggling the whole time at how fucked things were going to turn out. 

If you were as infuriated as I was to get kicked out of the library at 12 the day before an exam, rather than say, ""fuck the SA, fuck gov majors, fuck the frats"" keep in mind who actually has control of such decisions. A truly student-supportive school would have looked a proposal to *take away study time* and prevented such an idiotic concept at all costs. So write a letter to the registrar or somebody like CEO Martha and ask, what in the fuck is going on?

I'm a SA rep here. Saw lots of SA memes regarding study period thing. Feel like I should come out and maybe make some clarification thing. 

So decision regarding study period thing don't fall into Student Assembly. I guess it would come from calendar committee(cause it's about academic calendar) or faculty senate (since it's university wide academic policy). At least this semester, SA never discussed nor passed resolutions regarding study period. The history of SA meetings could be fond on SA website:[https://assembly.cornell.edu/student-assembly](https://assembly.cornell.edu/student-assembly) 

Also I personally wasn't aware of such change until couple of days ago when I was scrolling through reddit. If anyone can share me with decision and news report over the change of study period, I would be really appreciate it.

Again, if you have any question, feel free to comment/respond/dm to me via reddit.

Good luck on finals!"

The calendar committee is made up of mostly faculty/staff with the SA added on. However, if you read the report to the committee comments at the end, you can see that only 2 students (both I presume are SA) commented on the issue. The longest part of **both** students’ comments (pg. 36-37) is about how the new calendar would affect the amount of time IFC and Panhell members have to spend at home over break. Neither comment mentions the increased stress of fewer study days. As an IFC member, I would like to clarify to both members of the SA that commented that **I am here to learn first and socialize second.** I return to school early **by choice**. I study as much as I can because Cornell is a hard school and I am here to learn what I am being taught. The fact that nobody on SA dissented to switching the calendar because of student mental health (nobody on SA voted for the current [as it was] calendar) is horrifying. We elect you guys to represent the interests of the students and it is abundantly clear that you failed to do so. So, yes, the entire calendar committee is to blame for this travesty, but the SA is supposed to have our backs just as we had theirs during SA elections.

I'm looking through the approximately 500 practice problems that Ivan the Terrible posted, and I've come to the realization that I simply don't have the mental effort to work through these, or to even attempt to just interpret the answer keys. 

This entire class really has been a team effort, from piggybacking off of each other's questions in office hours, to the lecture questions, and especially to the CO-OPs. The final for this class is frankly just one big annoyance at this point. So I say, let's keep that same energy going into the final, and let's collectively agree to make the mean really, really abysmally low. Like, I'm talking lower than your chances of getting that internship at Goldman or SpaceX, lower than your GPA, lower than your self esteem. To the tryhards/kids to whom electromagnetism just comes naturally, good for you, guys, but on the final, please just take one for the team and write down ""Jσε"" for every question, and maybe whatever poor unsuspecting TA grades your questions will have the particular misfortune of writing ""joe who?"" on your test. If you're not into that, you could always just do the test to the best of your ability, then do what you do for the Learning Catalytics in lecture and simply raise all your answers to the zero power at the end of the test.

The means for the prelims were both pretty low, the class is curved to a B+, we get 3 problem sets dropped, and it's really just not worth it to study at this point... I think we can all agree that this is the best move for everyone involved.

I understand that this time of the semester can be difficult for most, and I hope the act of destroying our snowman was cathartic for you in some way, if only to know that he did not die in vain. But surely, there are better ways to deal with stress? 

This tragedy has deeply saddened me, but I shall persevere. My regrets are but twofold—that I may never again gaze upon the face of my creation, in all it’s glory, and that I know not the identity of his assailants, that I could express the level of disappointment I have towards you to your face

If this was you, I urge you to take a good, long look at your actions and how they affect others, and consider whether this is the kind of person you strive to be.

Best of luck with finals!"

Granted, I have limited to no knowledge about the system but just from an average college student looking in I would’ve expected these to already be laws, regardless of whether or not they were enforced. I do appreciate Martha’s email but it doesn’t really seem like it says anything… and yes if you are wondering I do have a final at 2 that I am avoiding studying for.

Dear Ithaca Campus Community,

Y’all know what happened last week on frat life drama. 

As I noted in my [November 19 community message](http://t01.list.cornell.edu/t/2925802/62429839/1204042/1044/), the unregistered fraternity party, during which freshmen were served alcohol and participated in drinking games, and all members got shitfaced and violated a number of Cornell’s Greek life policies. I find it particularly fucked up that Phi Kappa Psi had just attended a judicial hearing the day before for additional fuckery. The chapter has been placed on interim suspension pending a full review by the Greek judicial system because they never should’ve fucked with me. 

Regrettably, this is not an isolated incident as Greek life is just a bunch of assholes. We have on this campus, as do many of our peers on their campuses, a persistent culture of fuckery in the Greek-letter system; a pattern that dates back years, if not decades, and one that I have witnessed during my two-and-a-half years as Cornell’s president. Indeed, people tried to fuck with me over hazing back in the winter of 2018 and I announced a set of new Greek policies in May of that year. At that time, naysayers told me that the new policies would not shut this shit down. Unfortunately, those naysayers were fuckin right. In the 19 months since those new policies went into effect, fully six Greek organizations have engaged in behavior so problematic as to merit suspension of their recognition by the university. This number does not include the current interim suspension of the bitches at Phi Kappa Psi.

The full copy is attached for this reform, but I know once y’all see bullet points you stop reading so I won’t go any further. In conclusion, I’m trying and y’all are making this shit super fucking hard. Get your shit together.

Martha E. Pollack

Oh yeah, and it’s two parts, with a 10 minute break in between, and you can’t start the second part early. If you finished the first part early, you have to wait till the second part starts. Some had an HOUR wait in between the parts of the exam.

I was recently accepted ED for CoE and am probably going to end my first semester with a B in Calc BC and a C in AT Physics (our school rolls both AP Physics C courses into this one class). It is rare for a person in our school to jump from PreCalc Honors right into BC and also concurrently take AT Physics, and although this is a poor excuse for someone who is on track to attend in the fall I also got off on the wrong foot at the beginning of the year due to some personal reasons. I am mainly worried because both of these courses are related to engineering. Other than these two classes I have 3 other APs and another reg class, all of which I am confident I will be able to finish with As in. If these grades are maintained until the end of the year, how at risk am I?

tl;dr how much at risk with final grades of 1 B, 1 C, and rest As"

Just now, the nice single-room restrooms along the second-floor alley separating PSB and Clark were both being used, so I had to go to the infamous Clark Hall Restroom where there is a smoking Einstein on the wall. On my way to Einstein, I finally met them again -- they moved up to the god damn Clark 294D, where AEP students breath. I warmly said hi, and asked my former Physics buddies why they migrated. ""Well, it's brick out there."" said the male. He was right so I didn't even doubt his honesty for a second and went on to sit down next to them, which I thought would be perfectly normal. However, they gave embarrassing looks towards me when I did that. 15 minutes later, they said they were going to have lunch together, and just left me alone, again! They just made me feel so uncomfortable. I mean they could at least invite me. It's 2'o clock in the afternoon. Even if they just want to isolate me, they could have invited me to lunch cuz I was very likely to reject it. They are linear dependent matrices, and I am fucking orthogonal to them. I really missed the good old days. Together we spanned the whole fucking vector space. We used to be such a positive definite operator, with a full-rank Jordan canonical form.  Now I look at the empty seats next to me. All of a sudden, I become such a non-diagonalizable, nilpotent, sparse piece of shit. I am so done with them, but it's not my fault. Life will go on.

im just curious why the place where he was retrieved was the only bridge where there were no cameras?

Also there is a parking lot right on the same side were he was retrieved? could have been driven there? are there cameras along this route that could have recorded cars ?

small water flow in area suggests that he wasn't carried to the location? 

if he was so intoxicated how could he have gone in that direction which is completely opposite to freshman dorms/rpcc? likelihood of him making it there is very low especially under the influence?

bridge where he was retrieved is not a large fall/typically not a suicide area?

doesn't even know location?

fraternity contacted student that antonio was not at the event?

All of these facts together make an eerie story that we want answers to, please respond with any information or send an anonymous tip to the police with info."

In May 2020, we will be launching 2 3U CubeSats that will rendezvous and dock with each other autonomously in space, and need help writing software and reliability-testing the satellite.

The position is for 3 credits of research and would be a 10-15 hour weekly time commitment. We're looking for engineers with C/C++ experience and preferably some level of embedded systems knowledge or experience. This is an exciting opportunity to get involved with spaceflight and help develop something that will be going to SPACE!

The lab in general is also a great place to get associated with the aerospace industry--our research advisor, Dr. Mason Peck, is a former CTO of NASA, and five of the 12 team members on the project interned at SpaceX last summer.

On the one hand there are arguments to be made for why one might want to keep those stories quiet. For example, trying to minimize copy cat incidents. However, if I were applying to different graduate programs/professors, **shouldn't I be able to know exactly how many people have fucking killed themselves in the program?** Doesn't that go beyond polite information, and directly into health and safety?

I have done my best to thoroughly clean my room and have everything in order for the break.

Instead of reporting a charge to campus housing, I would like to pay you for the time you took to clean for me.

Sure it was alot of work and some stress, I've made genuine friends here and I absolutely love most parts about the school.

This break, I realized why I love it so much and I honestly feel shitty for it.

I love it more because I'm away from my family. 

Small family, so we really 'rely' on each other. Guess in some way it can be taken as overbearing parents. Not academically, but just really really tight. mostly in a good way, but stressful nonetheless. 

I've never had this much freedom. My parents always gave me alot, but I've never taken advantage of it. being here with them basically stuck in this house is honestly frustrating. I already got into an argument with them earlier tonight. the worst part is that they are honestly wonderful and I know many would love to be part of a family like this.

I just miss the routine I developed there. Sure i have friends home too but honestly after making these cornell friends i dont really want to go back to some of my toxic 'friends'

I feel like an asshole wanting to get away from this family. I am blessed in so many ways and I feel ungrateful. My parents have been nothing but supportive all through my life but I just cant stand the independence I had there.

I was celebrating this fact until the evening of Christmas Eve, when I received my financial aid offer. From what I can discern, my family is expected to pay the full price of $75,868 for one academic year. To be clear, I was expecting to receive minimal aid, but I have been all but blatantly rejected by the financial aid office. I understand that the university awards no merit-based financial aid, but I took my admission under early decision to mean that I was wanted on campus. I take offense to the fact that the university cannot offer me a dime. As far as colleges went, I was not ignorant to the fact that Cornell would be a costlier option, but I imagined a greater cost would be somewhat justified. There is no justification for a direct $300,000 expense over four years.

  I would not usually discuss the following details in a public forum, but, for background, they feel pertinent. I am an only child. My father, (who is looking to retire in the coming years) has an annual income of $90,000. My mother has an income of $10,000 - $30,000 from her investments. The problem lies within my mom’s assets, totaling approximately $1.3 million in said investments. I have never considered my family to be rich nor upper class. We live pretty conservatively, seeing as we could not recoup any major expenses through income. My mom worked hard to attain that level of financial security, and I take even greater offense to the fact that Cornell sees it as theirs for the taking, but I digress.

  Let me consider some hypotheticals for a moment. The cost above is strictly for undergrad. At this time, I am considering (or would at least like the option of) going to med school.  Forgive my rough estimate, but I would predict this to be an additional $300,000 (especially if it is at Cornell). For my mom to raise the combined total in cash, she would likely incur an expense closer to $1 million (accounting for hefty tax penalties and other costs associated with liquidating that quantity of assets). I cannot, in good conscience, ask my mom to spend the bulk of her savings on my education, nor would I be comfortable taking on that kind of debt myself.

  Perhaps I have been naïve in not paying enough attention to costs. I bring this to the subreddit in the hopes that someone can share a similar experience. Is this the expected (adjusted) cost of attending Cornell? Having just gotten this news, I have not been able to contact the office of financial aid due to the holiday. I fully intend on asking for my decision to be reviewed, but do I have any realistic recourse? Perhaps most importantly, is four years at Cornell worth $300,000? I had strong doubts that I would be admitted to the College of Engineering, but I never considered that I would be priced out of a school marketing itself as the most progressive ivy. I am questioning whether my admission was based on merit or merely my ability to pay. I hope to join you guys in the fall, but that may not be a possibility.

By the way, Merry Christmas everyone!"

After running through the last 300 posts on r/Cornell looking at every single comment, checking the flair of the user commenting I determined the following:

Number of unique CS vs AEP majors on r/Cornell:

CS: 44

AEP: 22

This number seemed suspicious to me, as I would argue that there is far more than a 2:1 ratio of CS to AEP majors at Cornell, but WHATEVER. Maybe it was just a coincidence. I decided to explore further. I then ran through those accounts to see what percent of each were created within the last year:

 Percent of the above accounts created in the last year:

CS: (6/44) = .1363636...

AEP: (16/22) = .72727272...

ODD. This seems like a statistically significant result to me. I took it one step further and logged the dates on which all of the AEP accounts were created, they are as follows:

1. It’s been a hot second since I took AP chem (senior year of high school), and my teacher was also shit. I taught all the material to myself and as a result it didn’t really stick in my mind afterwards. So, essentially, I don’t really remember anything.
2. I’ve heard some horror stories about 2070 and am worrying that I’ll be coming into 2080 woefully unprepared.

Harvard and Yale both have them and we can't let them boast their prestige like that, we need to show them we're on equal playing field. I'm thinking the upvote can be the Cornell logo and the downvote can be the okenshield stir fry.

so first!! as some background information , im a freshman at cornell. i didn’t go to the best high school academically, and most of the people at my school either go to community colleges, local colleges, or the military (which isn’t bad or anything!! but it’s a detail that helps with my question!!). im an out of state student , too!

basically, ever since i got into cornell during senior year, a lot of my friends began treating me differently and kind of harshly (comments like “you only got into cornell since your black” or “you think you’re too good for us now”), so even going into cornell left a weird vibe for us before i left. and while there, it kinda sucked to see my friends back home hang out together all the time and even have classes together. buuut, each time i came home, id try to visit them and spend time with them, and they would stillllll only hang out together and/or it would just feel like a much different vibe, which kinda sucked and made me feel bad. this break has been the hardest since a lot of old high school drama was brought up by them and a lot of bitterness /resentment was shown from them.  i now pretty much have dropped a lot of my friends from high school and have been super bored with nothing to do in my hometown :(( it’s been sad because i guess things just feel so lonely and stagnant back home? like there’s never much going on and most people just stick to who they know from high school (since everyone basically stays here), hence leading them to still have high school like habits (a lot of gossip and rumors) :// like there are other friends from high school who i love too, but they mainly just party, smoke, drink, etc (which isn’t bad or anything!! i completely understand!!) when hanging with people and im not into that.  

i just really dislike the environment here. buuut i do love to see and spend time with my family during these breaks!! but i also feel like id be muchhh muchhh happier if i stay at cornell / maybe explore ny during breaks (plus itd probably save money tbh).

so my actual question!! do you guys feel this dilemma of your hometown not really feeling like home anymore? and for out of state students, how have you’ve been navigating being away from home (missing family, hometown friends, etc.)? also, for those who don’t go back to their hometowns or haven’t in the past, what do you do instead?

super sorry that was a lot!! and i hope this didn’t come off the wrong way at all!! things just have been making me kinda sad and stuff, so i just wanted to explore some options !! thank u guys!! 💞"

I am a Computer Science Master's student from Europe and my academic advisor is well connected to some research groups at Cornell Tech. I am considering to pursue my PhD at Cornell tech and I have a few (financial) questions:

1. What salary can I expect? According to [this](https://gradschool.cornell.edu/financial-support/stipend-rates/) site, a standard contract would offer USD 27,218 over a 9 month period. Is this the correct source of information? It seems around 10 % less than the [glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.de/Geh%C3%A4lter/new-york-city-phd-student-gehalt-SRCH_IL.0,13_IM615_KO14,25.htm?countryRedirect=true) NYC PhD student average.
2. According to the same site from Cornell tech, I can also work 12 months instead of the standard 9 a year and I can work 22 hours a week instead of the standard 15, is this correct? So this would push up the salary a little ...
3. As I understand it, most PhD students then have a full tuition waiver, so I don't need to pay tuition fees from my salary - is this correct?
4. Do I have to pay taxes on my salary? If so, what percentage ca.?
5. Does  a university contract come with health insurance, or do I need to buy it extra? How much is this typically a month / year?
6. Can I get additional income, as life in NYC is expensive? I saw that some people in the research groups have a NSF GRFP grant ...
7. How well can one life in NYC with that total package?

Thank you in advance for providing me that information!"

The Cornell subreddit was, apparently, created roughly 10 years ago by u/drboda, who has been inactive for the last 10 years and has fewer posts on his account than I can count on one hand. It is truly remarkable that the spirit of this subreddit's founder has survived intact in its current users. Speaking of which, we have gone from just u/drboda and his alts to 16,674 readers at the time of writing, of which at this time approximately 22 AEP majors are active. We've also grown to a daily subscription rate in the mid double digits, and a monthly view rate of over 2 million for each of the last 2 months, of which, again, about 22 were unique. Through that time, we've seen moderators come and go, including u/laveritecestla (AEP '18) and u/TheD3xus (AEP MS '19), who recently graduated and who you may be familiar with. Some grad student and alumni lurkers may even be familiar with even older mods such as u/ConvexPreferences (unflaired), u/Enyo287 (graduation date unknown), u/TheIndigoSky (AEP '14) and u/SamuelGompers (EP '13), who had to be removed by force by reddit admins some time ago. He was actually so old AEP hadn't yet rebranded and was known as just EP. Some speculate this is due to Cornell's recent trend of grade inflation, before which there were no As given. Let that serve as a reminder: things could always be worse.     
  
If you're currently a Cornell student, you were probably between 7-14 years old at the start of the decade. Some of you probably spoke no English at that time or lived in a totally different country. Many of you probably didn't even know what Cornell was, or had never thought about going to college at all. We're 100% sure you were all fucking nerds tho.     
     
The world has changed a lot since 2010. Back then Two and a Half Men with Charlie Sheen was one of the most popular shows on television. People watched the Office on NBC, not Netflix. Snapchat didn't exist and Uber was a year old. The most popular song of 2010 was TiK ToK. Now it's an app, and owned by China.   
  
Cornell has changed a lot too. In 2010 our President was not Martha Pollack, a CS theorist, but James Skorton, a cardiologist. Imagine hiring someone to run a university who makes financial decisions like majoring in psychology. Martha has an h-index of 51. We didn't make that up, fucking chad she is. David motherfucking Gries has an h-index of 40. Who has more programming experience now, bitch?  
  
Some of the people reading this are probably ED admits or even RD applicants, so it seems appropriate to discuss how the university has changed in this regard, too. For the class of 2023, Cornell had an overall admission rate of 10.6%, and an ED rate of 22.6%. For the class of 2014, the statistics were 18.4% and 32.7%, respectively. By contrast, Harvard's admission stats were 7% for RD and no one knows the EA rate because they apparently didn't have it. Cornell's RD rate in 2018 was 8%, to put that in perspective. Idk about the rest of you, but this was actually more in line with current numbers than I expected. Notably, just 4 years earlier (Class of 2010) the admissions rate was actually 25%, with an ED rate of 40% for Cornell, and 9% and 20% for Harvard. I know this because I accidentally looked up these statistics instead of the relevant ones from a decade ago. Oops.    
    
Speaking of mistakes, let's go over some of the big ones. The 2010s looked so promising coming in, and yet we all ended up at Cornell. We are sincerely disappointed in all of you. More seriously, we made many mistakes this decade as a species, and learned from few of them. I'm going to get political for a moment. In 2010, we finally came together to give healthcare to the American people. 10 years later, we need GoFundMe to cover basic operations. In 2010, we elected the most conservative generation of politicians ever to the US government. Now, in 2019, we are poised to do the same again. Globally, Occupy Wall Street and the Arab Spring signaled a departure from the systemic oppression of earlier eras. Today, people in Hong Kong fight to defend their basic liberties from a dictator, and we deface even meager symbols of support for their people. But hey, at least we got some good memes out of it.           
   
Perhaps the greatest growth in the 2010s has been in the meme sector. One of the most popular memes of 2010 was a picture of Keanu Reeves. People still get massive karma with the same exact picture of Keanu Reeves. In 2010, people got their memes on reddit and cheezburger. Now, people still get their memes on reddit. Truly a transformative decade it has been.    
  
We want to give a shoutout to the r/Cornell community. Y'all are pretty dank. This community is by far the best Ivy shitposting subreddit, not that we really have any competition. But we are also helpful, welcoming, and insightful. Everyone in this subreddit contributes positively to the community, and we all really enjoy helping to keep this community spam-free for all of you.   
    
Here's to the continued perpetual growth of the AEP major, and another decade as the #1 Ivy shitposting sub. Whether you had a great decade or a shitty one, keep in mind: in just 100 more years, you'll finally be allowed to talk about 2110 finals on this sub again, and maybe Gries will even join you himself. Until then, shut the fuck up, and have a happy new year.

I’m looking to apply to some really interesting REUs and internships. Some of the places where I am applying require 2 rec letters, preferably from faculty in physics or math. I have one professor who knows me decently, so I plan to ask him for one letter. However, I am not that close with any other faculty members; I have only spoken maybe once or twice, if at all, with many of my other professors (I know, this ones on me. Should have gone to OH. Won’t be making that mistake again). Should I still try and ask some of the professors I’ve had but barely (if ever) talked to for letters? I would obviously go in and chat for a bit first, but I still feel awkward doing this; however, I’m tempted to still do this because most of the applications I’m looking at say they’d really prefer faculty letters, and most applications also give instructions for how to write/submit rec letters clearly geared toward faculty. 


For context, if I don’t ask another professor for a letter, I will prob ask a grad TA I had for one. I might also ask someone at a local science center where I volunteer (back home) for a letter. 

Also: I realize that if I ask a professor that I’ve never talked to for a letter, the letter won’t be as good as a letter from someone who knows me, and will probably be based on a paragraph or two that they will ask me to write about myself (if they even agree). However, I really want to get into some of these summer internships/REUs, and I can’t do anything about the mistakes I’ve made, so I’m trying to do whatever increases my chances the most. My grades are really good, and I’m starting research this semester, so my big weak spot is just my lack of connections. Another option might be to ask some of my professors from this coming semester for letters, after bombarding their OH for the first few weeks of the semester, but since many applications are due in Early/mid February, I’d again be asking after only a few talks and no real time to demonstrate my abilities in the class (if I ask a previous professor for a letter, at least they can look at my grades and see that I did well in their class).

We do not allow the CASE exam to be a “retake” of those exams.” I have taken only the AP Physics 1 exam and got a 4 on this exam. However, it is my understanding that one needs to take the AP Physics C exam for credit in 1112. I am just thinking that since the 1 exam is a subset of the C exam, and I did not get a 5 on the 1 exam, I might not be allowed?

Does anyone have experience with both of these courses? I am trying to decide which would be better for me to take: to get a sense of how machine learning is done. If I do the ML for Data Sci course this Spring, I'd probably do a 6000-level course in the Fall. If I don't take ML for Data Sci, I'll probably do an ML theory course this Spring and take ML for Intelligent Systems in the  Fall.

Please give your suggestions and comments if you have experience with any of the ML courses!"

As the acting boss of AEP, it is with a heavy heart that I must announce that the AEP major will be discontinued. You will all be receiving emails soon regarding further details, but I thought that it would be best to let all sophomores and freshmen know this as soon as possible, as the current junior class of AEP majors will be the last. It appears that the main reason the university is #cancelling the major is because of the overwhelming demand: over 100 sophomores applied to the major, and since this is over 4 times the usual amount, we cannot please everyone. And so, to avoid negative publicity and to prevent the whole university from being #cancelled, we will be discontinuing the major.

Sorry.

Fast forward I have spent the past 2-3 semesters taking information science classes knowing that at this point I won't be able to graduate anytime soon If I want to be an information science major. Basically my only option, because I can hardly afford to be here 4 years never mind stick around extra years and hope I find something better, is to do an interdisciplinary major that somehow combines the 50 different things I have pursued since coming here. My GPA is mediocre because I've only been a good student for the past 3 semesters, and I basically dig myself deeper into a depression everyday because my parents have no idea that I don't have an actual major. I've been working really hard to improve my GPA to offset my non-major.

I'm doing some genealogy stuff for a friend, and I came across this page: https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/99410828/mildred-buising

It references this woman's husband, who died September 1, 1975. I believe his obituary should be in the Aberdeen American newspaper, but I can't find it anywhere online. I found https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85042842/holdings/ which suggests that there is an archive of that paper at Cornell.

I was wondering if someone might be in the mood for a bit of a scavenger hunt and be able to track down that obituary. It would just be a matter of looking at the papers from that first week of September 1975. If you could send me some kind of scan, I would be super grateful. If nobody responds, I'll pivot to the other resources on that page, but I figured Cornell has a bunch of college students who might be willing to do this, more than the general population might :)

Fall 2019 course medians are up (i.e. visible on your transcript).

Cornell doesn't post the median info anywhere public - you can only see them for classes you've taken. For the democraticness of knowledge, I'd like to continue collecting them! You can add your medians to the same spreadsheet as last semester: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bXrOK-Pvqwc9X5C9cZ\_plYzj02GmI8rGE1AJVpKJm1U/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bXrOK-Pvqwc9X5C9cZ_plYzj02GmI8rGE1AJVpKJm1U/edit?usp=sharing)

And you can use overall information how you please.

&amp;#x200B;

How to get your transcript:

You can order through studentcenter &gt; open the drop-down menu &gt; transcript: request official, which will direct you to ""parchment.com"". There you can arrange to send your transcript to your email (for free). It will take 30-60 minutes for the request to actually go through (in my experience)."

A little information about me that may help in your response:

I am currently studying in a business school in a public university.
I have a college GPA of 4.0.
I have an SAT score that puts me within the top 1%.
My high school’s GPA is absolutely horrendous.
My extra curricular activities are fairly diverse.
I worked as an intern during the summer between my freshman year and sophomore year.

1. What is your favorite/best app to work for?
2. Is it easy to schedule timeslots or are they always full? Do you consistently get back-to-back orders when signed on?
3. Are there enough orders around CTown and campus that I don't have to ride downhill to downtown?

So I was recently reviewed by my college after my freshmen first semester and they are telling me to take a leave of absence. However, I can not do this at all and the issues that led to my first semester grades being so low was due to my parents thinking of divorce as-well as me being really sick with two viruses a week before my 2nd prelim and final which led to my poor grades in my main engineering courses. The divorce problem had a really huge hit on me because my dad is the sole worker and my mom doesn't have any qualifications to work at all, she is an immigrant who only went up to 11th grade in her home country and has trouble speaking english. I had to go home every weekend to take care of my siblings because they heard of the divorce too and were not being taken care of. It came to the point where I neglected my studying because family is very important to me and the anxiety and low key depression that I faced in the fall semester just made everything bad. The semester was not a reflection of my work hard and ethic at all but of the mental health issues and trying to keep my family together. Though it worked and I was able to keep them together as i talked to them, I feel like me being at Cornell was a big part of the decision they made. If I get removed for  a semester, I have no idea on how my family will turn out, my dad calling me a disappointment and him trying to sever his bonds with my mom and my siblings. He is verbally abusive and does not care to take drastic steps, I am a first generation low income student and my stay at Cornell is really important to me. I am sure that now that everything seems good and I have my life together, I am confident in my abilities to do very well this semester and beyond. Now I just need help with explaining this to the committee in an effective way. Any tips please? anything will help!"

A lot of people say AEP prepares you better for “applied physics” but how so? What specifically about AEP does this, assuming the physics major is inside concentrating anyway. From what I’m seeing, you would just take department specific versions of the corresponding physics class. Labs are the same, everything is the same. Correct me if I’m off. And also what’s the difference between applied physics and experimental physics? 

As for the clout of the name, it looks to me like both are neck and neck. Physics is ranked like 7th in the nation, and AEP is under the college of engineering which is pretty good nationally. BA versus BS is one thing I take note of. Amongst the general students, it’s clear that AEP has a lot more clout and I’m not sure why.

I went through the Cornell grind as a Chemistry major, had the ego beat out of me, and graduated with a truly mediocre GPA (3.3/4.0). I had a legitimate reason for why my grades were so bad in the one semester that tanked my overall GPA, but that doesn’t matter now. 

My goal was grad school, specifically a PhD. I had both deans and an advisor tell me that I had little to no chance because my record was so unspectacular. And I definitely felt that was true - in my graduating year, we had several students with 4.0+ GPAs. But I decided, fuck that - I was going to make my dreams happen. So I graduated, worked for two years in a top lab to get more experience, and just applied this cycle. 

I’ve already been accepted to two top-10 PhD programs, including an Ivy, with full funding. One of those schools even said that they usually didn’t accept anyone with a GPA under 3.5. I see a lot of posts here about students worried because they did poorly in one class or one semester.

1. How do you know which type(s) of CS elective (CS, technical, external specialization, major-approved, advisor-approved??) a class will count for? I saw the criteria/examples for technical electives on the website, but are there like lists of specific courses for each elective type or do you just ask your advisor?
2. How do you know whether courses can be counted for both a CS elective and a minor requirement? 
3. I checked through the subreddit history and saw that most people say minors aren't that useful. Is that true for CS too, like would getting a minor in Game Design or Robotics only be helpful-ish if you're certain that you're going into those more specialized fields?
4. Would an info sci minor be useful at all if you're already majoring in CS? For example I'm interested in the Interactive Technologies track, but would it be better to try to meet the requirements for the minor or just take classes in that concentration as my electives/external specialization if that's allowed? 
5. Is an external specialization pretty much half of a minor, and if yes, do a lot of CS majors minor in the field that they do their external specialization in?"

I tried making friends during O week, inviting people places and really going out of my way to talk to people. No luck. Nobody wanted any part of me. Next I tried clubs. But just because you have similar interests as someone, doesn’t mean you “vibe” with them. So next I tried sorority recruitment. Prior to this, I never really considered greek life, but I decided to branch outside of my comfort zone and give it a shot. I talked to a lot of the recruiters, making sure to be myself and I thought I was having some pretty great conversations with some of the houses. I was wrong. I got cut from every single house except the one that  everyone gets into. Don’t get me wrong, there was nothing wrong with the girls in the house I was invited to, it’s just that I know that that house isn’t for me and I didn’t vibe with those girls and the only reason I was invited back was because everyone is. That’s just fact. Anyway, I’m feeling a little hopeless at this point. I feel that there is something wrong with me, and that I can not pinpoint the exact issue that everyone seems so turned off by.

I did a bit of searching on the Cornell subreddit and saw a few comments hinting that the changes made in 2018 made the course easier and a bit less rewarding. Is there anyone with knowledge of both courses that could weigh in on whether there's any merit to that idea?

I'm also interested in any general suggestions or thoughts people have. I've heard the course is rigorous, and I'm hoping I don't get stuck along the way trying to learn the material myself.

That being said, one big incentive for myself is financial aid. To not put too fine a point on it, my family does not make much money.

Hi there,

My daughter is a sophomore at Cornell. She told me that one student coming back from Wuhan is sick and now her roommate is sick as well with the same flu like symptom. The email sent out from the school seems to indicate there is no risk to Cornell campus. But there are about 100 students from Wuhan area. The spread of the virus is at an alarming rate. What specific measures is the school taking to mitigate the risk at this point? Is it possible to mandate all students in the closed public area, like classroom, cafeteria to wear masks? Is it possible to follow up with all the students coming back from China by taking their temperatures and quarantine the ones if any suspect symptoms occur?  Cornell is a school with a large oversea  student body. After the winter break, many of them returned from China. These factors make Cornell a high risk school in my opinion.  As a parent, I am looking for proactive and specific steps to prevent the outbreak.

I noticed that it tasted a bit off, but I don’t like to waste food so I powered through and finished my plate. I then went to the stir-fry station to alert the chef that the stir-fry was not up to par, but when I arrived at the station I could see a mask-wearing dining hall worker shoveling the rest of the stir-fry into an odd looking bin with weird symbols and warnings on its side. Evidently my criticism was unnecessary, so I left. However, from then on I began feeling out of sorts. I developed a nasty cough, my head hurt, and I had trouble sleeping the following night.

Undeterred, I went back to Okenshields the next day. As I was walking out, I noticed that Happy Dave’s bowl of mints was almost empty. I brought this to his attention, and he thanked me. We got to chatting, and I mentioned my weird stir-fry experience from the previous day. Although he kept smiling, I noticed something subtle change in his expression. He began asking questions about how much I’d eaten, what symptoms I was experiencing, my familiarity with the Chinese coronavirus, and my opinions on controlled killings of infected members of society to prevent the start of an epidemic. I thought these questions were a bit unusual, and I couldn’t tell if he was implying something or just making smalltalk. I began feeling uneasy, so said goodbye and quickly walked away. He tried to go after me, but a line had formed so he had to swipe in hungry students. As I walked up the stairs from Okenshields, though, I heard him yell at me that he was sorry.

My symptoms have worsened since then, and in the past few days I’ve noticed Happy Dave following me around campus. Sometimes he’s subtle about it, hiding in bushes or perching in trees that I pass by. Other times he dons a backpack and wig and sits close to me in class, masquerading as a student. I have to bring my own water bottle to dining halls now because I’ve seen him slipping a weird tablet into my glass that makes my drink smell like almonds. The other day I swear I heard a bullet whizzing past my head as I descended Libe Slope, and when I looked up I caught a brief glimpse of Happy Dave scuttling away from a grassy knoll, decked out in a ghillie suit and face paint (his hair gave away his identity). 

I don’t want to die. I never even got the chance to take Formal Verification with Clarkson. Just in case I don't make it: please scatter my ashes in Okenshields. Give all of my possessions to my family, except for my dice collection, which should be given to Michael George. Trust me, he'll know what to do with it."

I understand the hesitations many Cornellians hold when it comes to Greek life. In fact, I used to hold them, too, until I joined a pre-professional frat last year and a social frat last semester, (and technically I'm in an honors frat but let's not count that). 

Last year 1st semester, although I had to work to make friends, like many people here, I wasn't thriving socially, and still ate alone most of the time. And, although I still ate alone at times last semester, I can't begin to express how powerful each brotherhood can be. I'd argue that from a time and effort perspective, there's no greater way to expand your social network. By simply joining one of these orgs, you instantly gain access to 80 or so potential friends (that hopefully share your interests/vibe), as well as the friends they often bring to events. 

&amp;#x200B;

I used to think fraternities were exclusively for ""frat"" types, but that hasn't been my experience. If you choose wisely, and aren't afraid to ignore reputations, then you will almost certainly find one you want to join. 

&amp;#x200B;

Plus, frats offer as much involvement as you want, usually. Want an event every weekend? Go! Want something once or twice a semester? That also works. 

&amp;#x200B;

For those that are lonely, and afraid to try something new, please consider joining a fraternity."

I noticed that it seemed a bit off, but I don’t like to mislead other students, so I flipped through Griffiths and wrote the correct equation on the board. I then went to the quantum professor to alert the department that one of the students was not up to par, but when I arrived at the offices, I could see the department head handing a crying junior a piece of paper that read, in bold red letters, “NOTICE OF DISMISSAL FROM AEP..” Evidently my criticism was unnecessary, so I left. However, from then on I began feeling out of sorts. I developed extreme paranoia and I had trouble following the flipped classroom lecture video for quantum 2 the following night.

Undeterred, I went back to the lounge the next day. As I was walking out, I noticed that the lounge was almost empty. I brought this to the department head’s attention, and he thanked me. We got to chatting, and thinking that as a professor of physics, I figured he could help me with my confusion, so I mentioned my trouble with understanding a concept in quantum 2 from the lecture video I watched from the previous day. Although he kept smiling, I noticed something subtle change in his expression. He began asking questions about how many classical scattering problems I have done, what does n_tar stand for, and my familiarity with scattering fractions. I thought these questions were a bit unusual, and I couldn’t tell if he was implying something or just making smalltalk. I began feeling uneasy, so said goodbye and quickly walked away. He tried to go after me, but he got a phone call he had to answer. As I walked down the stairs from the second level of PSB, though, I heard him yell at me that he was sorry.

My confusion has worsened since then, and in the past few days I’ve noticed AEP professors following me around campus. Sometimes they’re subtle about it, hiding in bushes or perching in trees that I pass by. Other times they don a backpack and wig and sit close to me in class, masquerading as a student that has mysteriously stopped showing up to class. 

The other day a student asked me for help with a homework problem from quantum 2 while I was sitting in the common area outside my dorm room. It was about scattering. I tried to help him the best I could, but I just couldn’t work out the problem. He the reached into his backpack and pulled out a piece of paper with the same bold red lettering that I saw a few weeks ago. But just then, I saw a student, who looked *just* like the student I was talking to, leaving his dorm, crying, while carrying out a ton of suitcases. I turned to talk to the student I was helping, but he was scuttling away. 

I don’t want to be expelled. I never even got the chance to take QFT. Just in case I don't make it: please scatter the ashes of my failed PSETs in PSB against some material with a target number density of 0.823 / angstrom such that the scattering fraction is greater than a third but less than a half."

eufhgq,Evan Lambrou -Lambrou Real Estate at Cornell (OFF CAMPUS APARTMENT HOUSING) -- HORRIBLE REAL ESTATE.

Trust me, YOU DO NOT WANT TO SIGN ANY APARTMENT WITH HIM. He manipulates the fact that students don't know much about real estate. Halfway in my contract, he tried to argue his way with me about raising our monthly rent AFTER signing. He said that we owe it to him because he has paid for wifi and water, which ""other landlords don't provide"". Except... that was part of the offer in signing with him for our original contract...?  Had to fight with him for 3 hours on the phone. Keep in mind, whenever you call him for some simple issue you want him to fix, he will make you stay on the phone with him for an hour to talk about how he provides you with ""amazing benefits,"" and manipulates the topics of the conversation so you feel like it's your responsibility to get your heating system fixed, etc.  

He's lost my checks before and then blamed me on 3 separate occassions. I had to go through the annoying process of contacting my bank those 3 times to confirm that I've sent my checks in and then had to call him to let him know. And somehow he magically finds those checks. Waste of time. He has no administrative skills-- he clearly does not keep track of his documents in a single place. 

It is worse because he lives in texas and has no office in Ithaca. So if you can't get a reach of him on the phone, then you're screwed. His mother lives in Ithaca but she does not answer any calls, ever. you need to call about 10 times for her to answer. It took me 4 months of trying to contact him and his mother after I left ithaca to get my security deposit back. Then, he finally returns only half of it. We never even left a scratch in the apartment (mostly because I barely stayed there for other reasons). I asked all my other friends who lived in 101 Dryden and turns out he took out $400-500 from each person, so he takes $800- $1,000 from the deposit per unit. He didn't even provide a professional, formal breakdown of the deductions. It was scribbled on a piece of paper by his mother ($850 for cleaning, $x for ... (can't even read what it says)). These are only a few instances out of way too many where I have had to deal with the unprofessionalism and manipulation of the Lambrous."

I wanted to get on here to see if anyone had any advice about making friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a second-semester junior who transferred Fall 2018 and just got back from studying abroad. Being that I transferred, I wasn't really a part of any formal O-week where many people meet/make friends as many people do as Freshman. On top of that, I was not offered on-campus housing last year and had to live off-campus further separated me for meeting new people. Even though it is the beginning of the semester, I am feeling very lonely and don't feel like I have friends to support me. I have been looking into joining new clubs and putting my self out there more, but even when I do that I feel like people are closed off towards me and don't really want to hang out. I have tried to meet people in my classes hoping to find people within my major that have the same interests as me, but I have yet to find another Anthropology major since coming here. I am longing for someone that I can hang out with even if it's just working on homework in the library or cooking dinner together. I am always open to experiencing new things and hoping to make some new friends."

How important are project teams for landing a prestigious internship/job? Does a mastery of the Cornell CS core sequence *alone* necessarily entail a bright future? Or is it not enough - to truly stand out, a project team is necessary? To put it differently, are the skills and knowledge I gain from a project team skills I'll gain *eventually* from a typical Cornell class? Because I know tons of kids who essentially only did CS classes at Cornell and not much else and landed jobs at Facebook/Microsoft/etc. Why? I don't know, but I presume that a very good understanding of CS classes alone granted them those jobs. And since they didn't do project teams, project teams aren't *that* important. And yet, I'm skeptical about that line of thought. Doesn't that imply that every 4.0 CS student from Cornell, Stanford, and MIT hog all the spots at prestigious tech companies? Let me know your thoughts. 

To be more specific, I'm thinking about enrolling in AppDev Introduction to Backend Programming. First of all, I don't know if I ""trust"" the course as much as an actual course run by an experienced professor who is an authority on the material. But the more important question is, will I learn the material taught in this course at some point in the future through my actual CS classes? 

I guess my overarching question is: what is the point of joining a project team? The knowledge gained? Or the collaborative experience? Or just for fun? Or a combination?

These questions may sound inane. Bear with me: I'm a freshman."

Or you may think: Its a requirement, and its listed as such. But hear me out:

1. There are no real discussions. There is only one grad TA for 23-32 students to do problems. This may be ok for BIOMG 1350, a concept based class, but 1 TA can't teach every student for a 1 hr session. There are no new concepts taught in discussions. There is also no attendance taken. Doesn't this take up 1 credit for the course? If there are no discussions, is it a 4 credit class?

2. There is no real syllabus. Just a list of topics. There are dates for the prelims and study sessions on the course website, but that's it. There is no syllabus displayed on Class Roster. If it is a real course, there would be a syllabus.

3. You don't know where you are in the course. Group quizzes teach you stuff that is explained after lecture. Learning Catalytics is nice but it is during lecture and the info escapes short term memory very quickly. Chem 2080 Tutors for certain colleges don't even  have materials from the class. How can they tutor a class that does not exist? 

4. The textbook is kinda necessary. The textbook is NEVER necessary for a STEM course. CHEM 2080 is supposedly a STEM course. But is it even a course at all.

CHEM 2080 has labs, yes, but they are not for learning. They are dungeons. You go to labs to suffer at the hands of your peers and TAs. No STEM lab tortures students as well as this one. But why? There are barely any undergraduate TAs for a reason. The course is set up to wear you down to the point that Professor Hines can eat you. She uses this course to draw uninformed freshman into her belly. TAs that had lasted up to that point weren't tasty enough. By the first prelim, some would have been devoured. Why do you think everyone around hasn't went to office hours? Because the ones that did are dead."

Abstract: This study sets out to discover the limitations of specific macro-nutrient-deficient eating modalities and the subsequent effects on gut flora and resulting waste production. Through the modulation of diet-induced GI effects, we intend to discover the threshold of the human body.

Participants will be expected to adhere to a starch only diet for the entirety of the 12 weeks, namely, eating corn. Resulting health effects will be carefully and diligently monitored, as well as waste product. The food waste we intend to study will be carefully examined for thorough digestion (or the lack thereof). Similarly, resultant energy levels and nutrition of the participants will be monitored.

Participants must adhere to the strict 12-week CORN ONLY diet.

Solid waste is not allowed to be flushed. Flush handles will be removed, and filtration devices installed.

Furthermore, video surveillance equipment will be implemented to ensure full compliance with the program.

Thorough anal examinations will be conducted on a bi-weekly basis.

Participants 18-21 preferred.

Edit: Participants will be compensated $0.03 per each intact kernel.

Totally fine, I mean it’s only human to complain, everyone does it right? However, I think it’s unnatural to not have anyone say a positive thing all day. It’s all about “I really hate using {this programming language}” or “{this person} really likes {that music}?”.

Initially, I was shocked Father Bezos expediated my Amazon Prime textbook delivery by a day and mentally applauded him for Amazon's fast delivery times. But instead, to my dismay, the package was a book filled with essays written by upperclassman that every freshman received. And what a waste of paper that is. I'd be shocked if more then 10 people in our class actually read any of that. 

Now here's the problem: the book is 112 pages long and printed in color. So what? you may think. But wait:

112 pages \* \~3200 students = 358,400 pages

358,400 pages \* 0.25 cents/page = $89,600

Environmental issues aside (granted this blatant waste should be addressed), if Cornell had its students pay for these books, we would have spent almost $90,000. And yet, they can't even give us free printing. 

If instead of spending ""$89,600"" (definitely less than this, but let me make my point), that money was given to students, we could have printed 995,556 pages in black and white. They just covered the costs of printing for every student for perhaps several years. Like, WTH Cornell???

Thanks for reading, I'm going to return to applying to project teams.

Side note: Instead of giving money to the institution, the institution should give money to us because we know how to spend it according to our interests. # Yang2020"

Now... what did my advisor, who I was supposed to trust and rely on, tell me to do? Withdraw and drop classes, and consider taking the semester off. She did not once recommend SDS or suggest accommodations. When I told her it was my preference to stay, she pushed me towards leaving the school and didn’t suggest anything to ease my time here. 

Fast forward today. I booked an appointment with SDS, without having an official diagnosis or medical papers. I immediately got a host of helpful accommodations that will help TREMENDOUSLY and help me perform at the level of healthy people. 

I am not suggesting that she should have given me accommodations, because that’s SDS’s job. But not once did she suggest SDS. She only suggest that I throw in the towel. She did not do anything to make my life easier in the short term, and it really fucked me. 

So do not listen to your advisors outright, because they will take the easy way out. Sometimes, there advice can be extremely helpful, but listen to your friends, your conscience, and look for other resources."

I am writing this message in a study room because I can’t hear myself think over the blaring electronic music enveloping my room. 

I’ve told you three times to keep your music down. And you do, for the rest of the day. The thing is, I’m trying to tell you to keep your music down *in general*. 

I don’t really know what’s normal here. A lot of people seem to enjoy blasting their music on my floor and maybe that’s socially acceptable behavior now. I didn’t have this issue when I was a freshman, probably just because the rooms aren’t right next to each other in the same way as west. Anyway, I'm pretty sure our GRF is intent on keeping our floor a barn regardless. 

The music is very disruptive to me. I’m pretty sensitive to sounds, have been my whole life for personal reasons. I can’t block it out. I have noise-cancelling headphones, but it goes right through. I have beeswax earplugs, but the low rumbles will still carry through it. 

I know, this is a pretty passive aggressive way to try to resolve this problem. I don’t think I’ve ever called someone out publicly before. But I’m too non-confrontational  to tell you this again to your face, so instead of planning on doing something that will never happen, I’m ending this here. Besides, the last time I told you to stop, I heard the Minecraft BGM on full blast, sheep baaing and all, so I know you’re the kind of nerd that reads Reddit. 

Look, I get it. I listen to this kind of music too. I like dubstep, in particular drumstep and electrohouse. I listen to these songs using *headphones*. Please, if you want to listen to music, use headphones. Now you don’t have to disturb everyone around you every time you want to listen to a song. If you do play music, play it quieter. Also, I’d be fine if you limited yourself to something like two hours a day. I just lose my mind when it’s a 24-hour rave. If you are not the person I am talking to, it would probably be beneficial to those around you to adhere to these guidelines as well, just to be more pleasant to your neighbors. 

It’s just that there are times where I don’t want to be listening to the sounds of literal demons. It’s kind of unfair. Sometimes I’m very tired and I want to lay down at 8:30, but I can’t because of the noises blasting through. I greatly prefer doing work in my room as opposed to libraries. In particular, I’ve been very sick this past week so maybe I’m more grumpy or aggressive than usual.

I involve in a much more competitive business club on campus, but I definitely hate the idea of being selective. I rushed Theta Tau because I don't like the business frat vibes and I thought TT as an engineering frat would be different. Apparently, I was wrong. For the second round interview, we have to dress up formally. I can't say much about the process, but we need to do a case study??? Ok then what is the difference between TT and other business clubs??? Also in the end, we have a 2-3 min personal interview, you have to stand up while they are sitting on the chair asking you questions like what is your strength and weakness like they actually care about you. 

At least I realized TT is not the place for me during the rush, but the people who rushed with me were really friendly and nice to me. Now the recruitment season is coming, I just hope the organizations on campus could be more embracing and friendly to our community. 

Best luck to everyone."

I’ve been feeling lonely quite often this semester for some reason, even though I’ve been more social and I have more friends than in the past semesters. Like I’m very introverted and spend a lot of time doing stuff by myself, but I do have a solid group of close friends who I can rely on and hang out with. And I have a decent amount of somewhat close friends/acquaintances from my previous semester’s attempt to be more social. As for clubs, I’m in a couple that I’m quite passioniate about. Let me put it this way: when I don’t want to be alone I can always find someone to talk to and study/eat with. 

But for some reason I’ve been feeling bouts of loneliness/isolation so often this semester. Like I feel extremely lonely whenever I’m not socializing/by myself, it’s almost as if I was extroverted and needed to socialize constantly to be happy (but I’m introverted). 

I mean this is good in a way as it forces me too socialize more. But I was just wondering if anyone could shed light on what could be the reasons for my feeling lonely when i do have people to socialize with. Also, what do you guys do on your own when you feel lonely/socially isolated besides talking to people?"

Our site: https://www.perfectmatch2020.com/


Hey Cornell! Valentine’s Day is upon us again and the Perfect Match Team has put together a new and improved matching system! After listening to your guys’ feedback from last year, we’ve spent the last few months devising what we believe will be an effective matching service. We were blown away by the 4000+ participants from last year and hope to be matching for even more people this time around! 


Additionally, we have a brand new feature for Perfect Match 2020: Crush Matching! At the end of our survey we will ask you for the netIDs of anyone you may have a crush on (you can put multiple), if your crush puts you as well then we will deem it a Perfect Match! 


We hope you are all as excited as we are for the upcoming Valentine’s Day and hope that you guys take our survey at the link above! For the sake of transparency, we have come to Reddit to answer any questions you may have about the process."

I know that they probably have a lot of mail to sort through with the number of people living in north, but I’m so tired of the inconsistencies with Appel processing my packages. Sometimes it’s within the same day as delivery, but more often than not I end up waiting an extra two+ days for them to process my package. I’m surprised I haven’t seen more complaints about this. I’m sure I’m just an impatient little shit but it really causes problems when I need something delivered fast, just to have it sit there for however many days. 

On more than one occasion I’ve had an important package delivered, waited three or four days with no email, but upon asking they refuse to check for my package because “you need to get the email”. Eventually someone checks after I contact senior staff and they manage to find it within 30 seconds. I understand the necessity of the email check, but it’s really annoying. Trust me, I don’t want to make problems and sound like Karen who asks for the manager at the slightest inconvenience, but my RA has told me that sometimes they literally just forget about your package and after three days it’s worth contacting staff.

And to those who work at mail services, this isn’t a shot at you, I’m sure the system’s just fucked and I wanna whine about it.

Tl;dr mail on north takes too long to process, does it get any better on west?"

The only info I am willing to tell was written on the last post, which some of you disgracefully doubted and insulted me, you pathetic fools. Karma is a boomerang bitch. And I have deleted pretty much all posts and comments I have made in this sub.

Third, wear mask and wash hands. And dont fcking judge those poor Chinese folks wearing masks. Better be safe than sorry.

Lastly, I personally would assume it is active in this community and be cautious all the time based on my observation.

Deleting this post tonight.

""I hope that zest for living, and for giving yourself to others, will accompany you on the continuing journey. For if you mortgage all your todays for some vague and gossamer tomorrow, you may find, in the end, that life's greatest joys and satisfactions have eluded you. As you continue life's journey, I encourage you to ride more merry-go-rounds and eat more ice cream. That does not mean a life of hedonism, but it does mean a life lived in the present, which is the only time we have.""

This is entirely my fault as I didn't put a lot of effort into making friends and I take full responsibility. Tbh I put all my effort into keeping my grades because Cornell was kicking my butt and now I realize that I am completely friendless and going to graduate extremely sad :(. I had more acquaintances and friends in my first two years, but then I did a co-op and when I came back everyone seemed to have moved on. In general, I find it really hard to socialize with people and am afraid of connecting with them because of social anxiety and such/ hating being the center of attention. This semester the sadness over having no friends is really starting to kick in such that I feel unmotivated to do work even though I literally need to becuz I need to graduate. Like i'm planning to join some open clubs welcome meetings just to see new people but will the people even accept me as Im basically a senior who spent years at Cornell as a hermit? Any help/ ideas is greatly appreciated thanks."

(Also this is my personal experience, take with a grain of salt). Hope this helps someone!

1. People say ""join clubs"" so willy nilly!! I think the key is to find an activity, like a job or club where you have to spend A LOT of time together. I joined a million clubs, but never made true friends in them because we only met for like two hours once a week. Being on a club sport, working job shifts, or something tighter knit (joining frat, becoming an RA, doing a PE that meets everyday, hanging out with people where you live) allows you to see the same people more frequently, which makes it easier to make friends!
2. Date someone! Okay, HEAR ME OUT. I know, how do you date someone when you barely even have friends? This one greatly depends on your comfort levels/relative attractiveness. I had literally never been on a date before, but I made a tinder and matched with someone who invited me to a party (literally my first house party, and they had no idea LMAO) , where I met some amazing people. As long as you're nice and have common interests, its pretty easy to slide into the friend group of someone you're ""dating"". One of my closest friends now is the old roommate of someone I dated. However, this one can also backfire pretty easy, so remain cautious.
3. Don't be too dismissive of people! Being friendless made me veryyyyy bitter. I'd see super loud sorority girls or frat bros in dining halls and lectures and think ""Wow, I'd never be friends with someone like that"". No one wants to be friends with someone who's super bitter (also they had friends and I didn't so who am I even to judge). You shouldn't be friends with people you don't want to, but be willing to give it a shot. I'm friends with athletes and greek life students, even though I'm neither.
4. Utilize your major! You probably spend a decent amount of time studying. I know theres that person you see in a ton of your classes, but you have NO idea what their name is. BITE THE BULLET AND ASK. Study buddies are a great way to bond and get work done. 
5. You're not gonna want to hear this, but if you're like me, you might have a funny lil boii called Social Anxiety. And if so, I'm so sorry but you're gonna have to force yourself to talk. Trust, I can barely order at Nasties without dying inside, but it makes it a lot harder to make friends if you're not able to communicate consistently and openly. This is a lot easier said than done, and took several months of forcing myself to talk in classes to get used to speaking to strangers.
6. Be kind and patient with yourself. Some people make friends for life during O-week. For others, it takes a bit of time. I was always so lonely, and thought I'd never truly find companionship here. There are ups and downs, I've made friends and also lost some, but it all will work out for you :)."

Also if you're not into streetwear, or you wouldn't consider yourself a sneakerhead I also strongly urge you to enter your info in because we wanna include as much of the Cornell community as possible. Great things happen when people from different backgrounds come together.  My idea of a streetwear club, is not to just to come together to talk about sneaks, but also to foster an inclusive, diverse community where everyone's thoughts, ideas, and values are respected. Much love y'all!"

What confuses me the most is that we have 100s of useless ""Deans"" in every college in the university that make hefty salaries and yet the people in charge of monitoring severe weather conditions (which are a typical occurrence in Ithaca) are seemingly non-existent. 

What sort of logic goes into delaying the decision to cancel classes until 10AM, when students have already traveled to campus without bus transportation (which was cancelled as early as 830AM)? Some professors have already taught their Friday morning classes and even after classes were cancelled some discussion sections are being held to the students that remain on campus. One professor stated it took him 1.5 hours to get to the 9AM lecture that he teaches.

This statement is written in profound frustration, as this university fails time and again to adequately and professionally handle days with severe conditions in Ithaca. Cornell could learn from the other universities in the area which seem to get it right when it comes to cancelling classes in advance when forecasts are particularly harsh. Today, every other campus in the area besides Cornell was closed in advance, or at least early in the morning so that students could make accommodations.

I wish Cornell, and every other campus in the world, would be purged of 40% of its yearly revenue so instead of wasting it on meaningless admin/staff positions it would be forced to utilize its resources most effectively and properly align them with the interests of faculty and students, the lifeblood of any learning institution."

As I open the door and exit my dorm, swirls of white powder bite my face and my hands. As hordes of freshmen struggle their way through the Balch Courtyard, I realize that my imagination and prospects of frolicking in the snow had been deeply misguided.  I take a deep breath and, as my face slowly numbs over, reluctantly join this Great North migration.

I may have not known who was walking besides me this morning, but when we trudged downhill side by side together, persisting through the great Ithaca winds, we all became brothers and sisters in arms. I slip down some frozen ice and hurt my knee, but a woman pulls me up and helps me continue on this arduous, perilous, tortuous journey. I can no longer see the horizon. The edges of Rockefeller hall are no longer well defined. Am I fainting? Is this it for me? Am I really willing to put myself through this for a physics lecture?

As I draw closer and closer to my destination, I notice more and more people walking the opposite direction as I. Are they coming back from class or from battle? A holy messenger in the form of a 20-year old student yells, ""Classes are cancelled! Classes are cancelled! Classes are cancelled!"" Do I trust this man and return home to the sweet comforts of my bed and the warm heat of my dorm? Or do I march onwards? How do you know if you are listening to the horn of Gabriel or witnessing the evil tricks of ad-Dajjal?

Then a holy message from above. ""Ithaca campus classes are cancelled 2/7"" There is a noticeable pause in the line of people trudging uphill, a feeling of tension and confusion that permeates the air.

Moments pass, and we turn around and walk back to North campus, not as students struggling to get to class, but as free beings about to enter a day of possibility and liberty."

I want to do something meaningful with my life (ie not classes) where I can improve my technical skills as a CS major. But what can I do??? What opportunities are left for me? I’m in a club but I don't feel like being in it is contributing much to my personal growth. I guess maybe I could try other clubs but idk.
I just feel so unwanted at Cornell - I feel like my friends are all so absorbed in their own life/academics they don’t really care about me as an individual. Or our personalities dont actually mesh that well and they’re only staying around me out of convenience or something. And everything related to academics I’ve tried to do I’ve been rejected from, though I’m not told why, probably because there was a limited number of spots and someone else was a better candidate.

- I’m currently in 26 credits. I’m intending to drop a 4 credit class and replace it with this 3 credit class. I will have to petition to over-enroll again (I assume).

- I have a conflict with another class’s discussion. The professor doesn’t care which discussion you attend though. But I would ideally like to officially switch my current one to another one (I know it’s open). Would this be doable?

How do I even begin this process?

I don't know what it is about Cornell but the gay men here are just so cliquey. Even the woke gays suddenly hug their ankles when they see a guy that's above a 5. In friend groups alone, you are basically either boxed into a very specific image and that's the crowd you're allowed to hang with (very rigid structure) otherwise you have to be hot AND/or popular (usually both). I'm not even a bad looking guy, but the importance that some gay men here place on social media and creating this fake image it gets exhausting being around. I feel like in more than any other group if I'm not getting 500 likes on my instagram i'm not enough to be friends with never mind date certain people. since i'm in a terrible mood, I also want to call out on person on this subreddit. i'm sure other people know who they are irl and yes I want them to read this, they're obviously a physically attractive guy but have made a couple posts/coments here about their experience/'trauma' in the gay community. Bitch you're cute, white, and seem straight, there's like 15 people interested in dating you, but we all know you're superficial as fuck. Not even in the social media realm but you match with everyone on tinder and my friend msged you last year and you gave some sarcastic response because you think he's not on your level. Why match in the first place? Cus u think ur hot n just want to inflate your little ego.Get over yourself. you pretend on here like you're some proud gay with no luck in love when we know you don't associate with most gays and have lead on or ghosted SOO many people. I read one of your now deleted stories on here about a night that I was definitely at where you failed to mention how miserably you treated my friend practically boxing him out of your conversation because he doesn't look like the people you associate with, i wont say more cus i don't want to reveal who i am but you know what you do anyways. You're just the epitome of everything wrong with the gay community here. Kinda cute but entitled as fuck because of it. Your posts are like someone living in an alternate reality. And you seem SOOOOO sweet to everyone else which just makes your two-facery even worse. Ugh you're just one example but yea you disgust me. I'm happy to not have seen you on dating apps in a long time fucking with people because you're insecure,but i'm sure you're somewhere out here being all judgy and two-faced. Oh my friend is one of your perfect matches but i'm sure you won't have any communication with them, they're not white. you dick. stop pretending on here, no1 who knows who you are is falling for it.

The security deposit is only 500$ but it’s still a significant amount to a poor student like me. 

My landlord responded today and is denying liability for my claim because of damages to the property like a dirty stove or bathroom which were incurred by my roommate who had lived there an entire year prior. They didn’t give me a list of the so called damages, and I cleaned the place by myself (since my roommate moved out before I did and refused to help) as best I could before I left but it still wasn’t perfect. 

They never told me to document damages to the place before I moved in which I later learned they are legally required to do. So there’s no proof of when the damages occurred. 

Now they are charging me for ~700$ in so called damages as well as whatever other legal fees they need. Obviously my plan backfired but how fucked am I and is there any free legal consultation on campus I could get?"

A sigh of relief escaped my mouth as I inhaled deeply to loosen my pelvic floor. When the stream dilated my urethra and sent waves of pleasure through the compressed prostate, I knew I had made the right choice in excusing myself from the CS2800 lecture. 

Unsurprising for the heavily abused Uris bathroom, the bowl I found myself in front of was already half full due to the neglect and malice of previous users. It was a suspension of finely aged urine, stratified in accordance to time, consistency and urea concentration. With my lemonade joining the punch, the layers are now disturbed, and the ancient and oppressed urine once more gasps for air. At once, my olfactory nerves were under siege by the odour - a delicate blend of musky earthiness from the stale, and crisp pungency from the fresh. 

Trying to distract myself, I found myself fixated at the frothing man-beer, entranced by the rapidly forming bubbles, merging and annihilating each other as they blinked in and out of existence. The awe had masked the brisk droplets of the unholy mixture, now sent airborne by my stream, settling on my hands and water snake. Realisation came too late, as the uric acid and ketone bodies permeated into my skin. 

But was it all urine? The previous creepy looking dude did take a lot longer than a bona fide piss session. Was he shaking the urine, or were the jerks and shivers a product of something else? As I start to doubt whether it was even his bladder that he emptied, and thinking of the potential STDs that accompanied his phallic gravy, my stream quickly ground to a halt. With my anus now clenched and perineum tight, the pee-valve has been completely crimped shut, and I start to implode from my internal forces as the remaining urine desperately fights to reunite with their departed brethren. 

Ultimately, my pelvic floor, as strong as it has become, yields under the sheer force of amassed kidney nectar. As the stream became squirts, the squirts became droplets, I perform the routine shakes, slaps, and swings despite my already salt-bleached trouser crotch. The bowl was filled to the thanks to my hefty contribution. Being the virtuous individual I am, but perhaps more compelled to cleanse the world of this cursed brew, I smacked the flush lever, shuddering upon contact with the sticky dried urine. I have made a terrible mistake. A massive upwelling caused by the flush sent seismic waves that tipped the fragile balance of surface tension, sending the golden tsunami straight to my still open zipper and wetting my pants. 

Now in a state of shock from the combined feeling of disgust, surprise, and the caustic mixture eating away at my legs, I fumbled to wash my hands and devise an escape plan. It seems fortune was on my side as I greeted my fellow lecturer-goers, all with thoroughly wet crotch. Was it in fear of the impending prelim, or was it in awe of the girthy presence of Prof. George? I did not know, nor did I care. 

As I mingled flawlessly into the crowd, all with wet crotch be it from urine or something else, I thought of Prof. George’s delicate voice as he explained proof trees. Becoming NP-hard, and overcame with emotion, I felt time stop as I convulsed violently and felt the wet patch at my crotch expand in size. The crowd, still enthralled or shell shocked, did not care. Laying as I fade into unconsciousness, suddenly I felt ... clarity. I saw what came before the Big Bang. I derived the proof for division by zero. Even the four loopy questions, once unintuitive and cumbersome, suddenly made sense. I was content. 

Eventually, I was woken up by a CS2800 piazza post that breached my email settings announcing homework one grades. I wandered home, collapsed from pure exhaustion, and dreamt of being led, on one hand by Martha, the other by Happy Dave, to the eternal embrace of David Gries in a land where there is no pain, no disease - where classes are never full, and buses never late."

As for the housing I am looking for, I will be working in Back Bay, so I prefer living either somewhere close to the neighborhood or close to the green line. Budget wise, I am looking for an apartment that is around $1500 a month, but can go up to $2000.

Mainly out of boredom and curiosity, I've done a bit of math to justify this claim, and resulted in a prediction for the Class of 2024's overall acceptance rate to be approximately **9.85%**. 

Although its just an educated guess, I sure hope (and am a believer) that Cornell's overall acceptance rate will finally break the 10% barrier this year. Alas, maybe we'll finally join the sub - 10 college club huh. 

In my calculations, I analyzed a variety of factors known to influence the number of applications Cornell accepts, and the total number of applications received (such as past yield, target enrollment, and the increase in # of applications). Cornell's removal of the mandatory SAT subject test policy for CAS's co2024 probably played a significant contribution to the increase of ED applications this year. 

Feel free to agree with or refute my claim. Hopefully this topic sparks up some interesting discussion/debate."

Let me offer the opposing view — we should be immensely grateful to them for the service they’ve provided. The economy is what gives us life, gives us purpose and employment. What energy source has driven the economy in centuries prior to the last decade? Coal, oil, and every dirty energy source we can find.

That same economy, which has allowed the US to grow into a stage IV country that can refocus on the environment, is now vilifying fossil fuels in favor of green energy. What fuels the trucks carrying solar panels across the country? What fuels the crane that lifts the generator into the wind turbine?

Ultimately fossil fuels are indeed dirty and terrible for the environment, but the oil and gas companies keep the lights on and keep millions of Americans employed across the country. Green energy is part of a luxurious, futuristic world and something we should aspire towards, but fossil fuels have helped us immensely in reaching that world."

If anyone else is as angry as I am, please send Climate Justice Cornell an email at cjc.cornell@gmail.com. As an active environmentalist, I don't give a flying fuck if you used biodegradable streamers. Those streamers had to be cleaned up by low-income workers who had to drive all the way here to deal with your mess. Do you know what happens when biodegradable streamers get thrown in a landfill? They sit there, unable to properly decompose as they release toxic methane gas into our atmosphere.

Way to go destroying this planet you so claim to love. Please reconsider your actions.

Sincerely,
Everyone else who actually cares about the planet and the people who live here"

Yes I'm probably gonna have no friends in the graduation ceremony.

And all i do is just cry in bed. I am done with trying to make friends. Everyone has their group. It's too late. 

I just spent 3 years repeating getting my hopes up high and being frustrated. I'm too emotionally exhausted. 

I am not pessimistic. I just became realistic after experiencing all those frustration.

The bus driver tried to kick her off the bus. She, nor any of her friends, had the $1.50 for the toll. She literally had to go passenger to passenger and beg for money. If my girlfriend didn’t have a bunch of random change in her pocketbook, she would’ve been forced off. 

To me, that should be absolutely unacceptable. 

For one, she’s a Cornell student, it was after 7:00, and just rides were free anyways. 

For two, it was **-7°** outside. 

And lastly, it was midnight. 

I feel like someone should be ashamed of themselves for trying to force young woman at midnight in literally deadly temperatures to walk home because she didn’t have a dollar 50. 

Does anyone know a good person from TCAT to reach out to about the situation? Is the situation even worth reaching out for? Like I get it, she shouldn’t have forgotten her ID. But to try to keep her stranded miles away from home because she didn’t have spare change is downright cruel."

660 has a bit less of a time commitment I think because there are no required cook groups, which I like; but, Watermargin is like half the price, so there are pros and cons to both.

Me: Man, I’m really tired. It’s normal to be tired.

...But I feel like I’m just a bit more tired than is normal. What’s a normal amount? I feel... exhausted. Homesick and cold and unmotivated and mainly just burnt out. But that can’t be. No, no. It’s much too early in the semester for me to feel this burnt out. Should I panic, then? Why do I feel this way? Does anyone else?

Me: Well, of course others feel this way. You may not have heard them say as much, but you’ve felt it. It’s in the way they move; the way they hunch themselves over against the cold but still curl a little ways upwards, outwards, towards the sun, like they’re trying desperately to hold on to their little inklings of hope and keep them trapped for as long as they can bear to. You’re not burnt out quite yet, you’re only a little lost. You will get back on track.

Me: ... But I’m not back on track. I don’t *feel* on track. And even if I was, how could I know? Everyone else seems so successful, so put-together; maybe not content but complacent. I can’t even get comfortable long enough for ambivalence. Instead I feel disappointment, discouragement, general lack of excitement for things that I used to enjoy! Why? 

Me: It’s likely because... because you’re holding yourself up to a standard that doesn’t exist, in and of itself. There is no definite metric by which to measure your success. You must go at your own pace, and take your victories, however small, as they come, or else you have doomed yourself to suffer through problems of your own making and of your projection onto other people. They are not the enemy. And, however much it may seem like, neither are you. Push through just a bit longer. You can. You must.

Me: For how long? How long must I grin and forge ahead without knowing my destination? How could this possibly be the right way of accomplishing anything?

Me: Perhaps it is not the right way. But that is of little consequence, since all that matters is that you preserve your own way. Don’t fall into mindless conformity to invisible milestones; they were set for and by others who could never possibly hope to feel the way you do, to move in the way that you move. In a place so communal, strive for the unique. 

Me: Alright, then. What they say is common, trite, I rebrand as individual. I make my own; I create. I will keep going; despite not knowing where my destination lies, if it lies... IN spite of this. My knowledge will suffice. It must. 

It was never about the missed sleep, but the missed opportunities at greatness; and greatness is not told in size, in impact, or even in boldness... it is told in the quiet times in which we can tell ourselves, with near-perfect conviction, that what we have done, through no merit or device but our very own, is, and forever will be, enough."

* Some of these people are physically incapable of not flexing on each other every other nanosecond
* I'm stupid so it's gonna be hard

I recently got accepted into the M. Eng program for ORIE. I really would like to go into industry and solve cool problems while making some money. However, from googling ""is M. Eng worth it?"" (because it is a shit ton of money), it seems that some people hold the view that the M. Eng program here (or many other places) isn't prestigious, that they accept pretty much anyone, and is just a cash cow for the university. This has me rather bummed that some would hold this view, as I felt as though I had something unique to offer rather than being a walking money bag. I also would not like to be viewed as ""inferior"" to my peers on campus. I do not hold this view, but it is what I have seen some express online.

Anyway, I'm an undergrad in math and stats at another institution, and it appears many companies require a masters for operations research. Would the M. Eng achieve this goal and would it be worthwhile to pay the 50k? I have low debt thanks to scholarships. So it would not be much more to add, especially since it is only a one year program."

Here is a fact for you - livestock causes 15-18% of green house gas emission vs 14% by the transportation sector.  You can survive by not eating meat. Some of you people need a reality check because we cannot survive without the transportation sector. The electric vehicle technology and cost is just not there yet to abandon combustion engine cars.

In my opinion, it would be better use of time to advocate stop eating meat and for Cornell to offer plant based meat substitutes."

It's great, you know? I get to pay attention to all the processor architecture and data hazards without worrying about getting the flu or coronavirus since nobody's there to cough on my back.

Then, literally &gt;20 minutes into lecture, this girl barges into the lecture hall and plops herself down right next to me, letting out a quiet (but still audible) fart. She shot a sideways glance at me to see if I had noticed. I had, but I avoided eye contact. I guess she took that as a cue to continue letting out farts.

So the next one came about 2 minutes later. Still pretty quiet (in fact, all you could hear was the *swoosh* sound since she spread her cheeks on the seat) but **damn** that thing smelled bad. Must've been eating at Okenshields or something. It smelled like a combination of rotten cheese and pineapple juice and fish sauce. The people sitting in front of us started looking around to see what had died, faces scrunched up in disgust. And since I was (comparatively) unruly and of course, male, they suspected *me.*

I think my corner-companion noticed this too, and so she began letting out louder and louder farts. After about 4, she let one rip that I'm pretty sure echoed off of the walls of Olin 155. She even got Hakim Weatherspoon even paused for a second to ponder on what the noise was. Was it the throttle of the first ever Intel processor running? Surely not.

Now, being the germaphobe that I am, I of course carry N-95 respiratory masks around, so to give her the cue to **stop farting**, I put one on. But unfortunately even that wasn't enough to repel the sheer pungency of her flatulence. Eventually, I had no choice to leave the lecture, before I'd even managed to answer the last iClicker question.

My TA also grades really hard on the group quizzes and my group has only three dumbasses (including me). Not only that, they are Environmental Engineering majors so they can get a C while I, the premed dies in their wake. I just saw the answers to this week's GQ and I already know that we are going to fail another one because I am the only one who does their part while they bring nothing.

What kind of shit is this? Either you’re gonna be the one monopolizing the discussion, or your own individual thoughts and experiences are never going to make it to whoever’s reading the course evals (assuming there actually is someone reading this shit, which I doubt). What is this university’s obsession with transforming education, something UNAVOIDABLY PERSONAL and INDIVIDUAL, into something defined solely by your role in a group? 

Cornell students are not the Ising model off the critical temperature. Stop trying to coarse grain us. (And no, the analogy is not in vain—it is a stat phys class.)

Imagine approximating the wheel behavior by assuming that, as soon as power is done being delivered to one bucket while it moves horizontally, another is suddenly perfectly in place to start receiving the same rate of work done, so that this power is continuously being delivered to the wheel and 𝑚 is now the maximum possible value 𝜌𝐴@𝑉@.

d) In practice, it is better to turn the jet 165 degrees in the frame of the bucket (instead of 180), so it barely avoids the incoming jet – a picture of such a wheel appears in problem 3.162 of the 8th edition and below. By conservation of mass, the total velocity of the outward jet in the frame of the bucket has to have the same size as the total velocity of the inward jet in that frame, but now you multiply the bucket frame velocity of the incoming jet by cos(165) to get the horizontal component outgoing jet velocity in the bucket frame.

&amp;#x200B;

So here are my tips to stand-out as an engineer:

1. Introduce yourself: How many people have you seen for two years in all of your classes and you still don't know their name. Just say ""Hi, I'm $name\_var"" and shake their hand. People will always respond with their name.
2. Invest in a full-length mirror: And look at how you are dressed before you leave for the day. Your perception of yourself should match how you appear--and while you DO NOT need to dress-up for Tuesday 8am class, you want to appear clean, prepared, and put-together.
3. Everyone has a strength and it might not be school: Engineers pour themselves into study, but other people focus elsewhere. Respect that school might be number three for someone who prioritizes being a great club president and a socially butterfly. That person is just as smart and talented as you are.

""Dear Parent/Guardian: 

Greetings from the Cornell University Undergraduate Admissions Office! We are delighted that your student has applied for admission for fall 2020. The application process can be both an exciting and challenging time for seniors and their families. I am writing to offer you our assistance and support. Let me share with you some important updates about the admissions and financial application processes. 

We have notified your student regarding our receipt of their admissions application.

By now, your student should have received an email granting them access to their applicant portal online. This secure portal enables us to share general updates with your student and other applicants. Please help us by encouraging your student to access their applicant portal and monitor their admission application. 

We will contact your student several times if they are missing admissions application materials.

Students who are missing required application materials have been receiving emails reminding them to view their materials checklist in their application portal, so they can identify and submit missing documents. If your student’s application is incomplete, they will continue to receive an automated email every few days over the next three weeks with a reminder to complete their application. We hope you will help your student complete the Cornell application process by ensuring all of their application materials are submitted as soon as possible. 

We will work with you and your student to submit your financial aid application materials.

Cornell Financial Aid staff work closely with students and families and are committed to making a Cornell education affordable. To be considered for financial aid, students are required to submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), the College Scholarship Service (CSS) Profile, and 2018 income taxes. Once you and your student have begun the financial aid application process, they will receive an automated email with their applicant ID to access the online financial aid materials completion checklist. For more information about applying for financial assistance at Cornell, please visit finaid.cornell.edu.

Please know that the Diversity Outreach team can assist your student in ensuring their Cornell application is complete and that it is evaluated by the admissions committee.""

I will be enrolling in Cornell's class of 2024 planning to be a biology major on the pre-med track. I am feeling that I made a mistake in choosing Cornell for pre-med though, compared to other institutions like Brown or Duke. I was originally was planning to do medicine in the UK as some of my relatives did, but did not do well enough on the UCAT to be accepted into any BS/MD programs there. I also made the mistake of procrastinating my U.S applications while busy with the UK ones. Now with less than a week before ED deadlines, I made the hasty and shortsighted decision of only looking through a couple pre-med ranking charts and seeing Cornell listed there, and picking it as two of my cousins go there. Only after the initial elation of being accepted did I start browsing this subreddit and the premed subreddit and learned about the grade deflation and larger class sizes at Cornell. I have always struggled with math and physics, but I know I cannot avoid this if I am to be a doctor. The harsh grade medians of some of Cornell's intro courses scare me though, as some very bright students seem to be averaging a B-. Our financial situation is at the spot where we do not make less enough to qualify for a lot of aid and not as much to comfortably pay full tuition. I will end up paying around 250k for my 4 years at Cornell and probably much more if I am to go to medical school after. I really want to be a psychiatrist and I would say that I am around 90% sure that I want to do pre-med. I am really excited to go to Cornell and will definitely work hard but have been irked by the many people saying pre-med at Cornell is not worth it and will be hell. I am afraid that even after putting much effort into courses like Chemistry, I will do worse than my peers even if they have studied less. What is my best course of action here and what should I expect? Sorry for the long post.

Thank you"

-I don’t know what I did wrong.  Everyone either thinks it was my choice to not be in a srat or they assume I’m in a srat. Nobody knows how painful and lonely and sad and embarrassing this is.

I don’t see any way out of this but to transfer to a school where i can start over and hopefully join a srat and find friends.i cry every day and don’t know what else I can do. I never thought this would be my Cornell experience but I can’t sacrifice any happiness I might still be able to have in college + my mental health for an Ivy League degree.  Even if I’m afraid that I’ll always feel like a failure for leaving.

Pls let me know if u have any suggestions for me? I don’t want to throw away Cornell but I can’t spend my college years being an outcast while everyone I know is having the time of their lives. This semester is already depressing enough. I feel like such a failure and fool but I don’t see any way out of this besides a transfer and now I have to wait for months to hear back about that too. I can’t spend my whole college life on hold waiting for things to get better. I can’t believe this is my life. 
Thank you."

I already have the opportunity mostly lined up to do some research with another professor at another university this summer. Since it's not part of an official program, the professor told me currently that it is a little uncertain their his university can provide the stipend for me this summer and I should check with Cornell first.

I've gotten more than a standard deviation below the mean on every assignment so far and on the prelim, and the worst part is that I've been aware of this and trying to correct it, but it doesn't seem to be working. 

I went to 4 different office hours last week. Obviously some of these are better than others. A big problem I'm seeing is that the TAs themselves are not given solutions to the homeworks (in fact, I dont think they exist in any physical form anywhere), and so I get the whole deal with different answers from different TAs and TAs being unsure how to solve a problem. Anyway, despite all this help I managed to get 1.4 stdevs below the mean on the last HW, which means a lot of people are getting it and I'm not. 

It's not even like I look at the HWs and don't know what to do. On the last HW, I was extremely confident that it would do well, and then it flopped. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for how to improve from this point? I've tried doing things like reading the textbook, but the textbook is pretty awful and I don't think I can gain anything from it. Perhaps my only chance is to band with some other people to do assignments together. I'm a junior and I've never had this much trouble before, which is why I'm so concerned."

I don’t have any extra curriculum, I don’t have much stats to prove myself but the only reason why I did so bad my previous years was because I literally sat on my ass and did nothing. If Cornell does interviews I could finesse that as well and yes, I know Cornell doesn’t fuck around and the interviewees probably have a really high bullshit detector but I’m confident in my ability to persuade and sweet talk without seeming like bullshit. 

I can definitely pass all my classes and accumulate all the credits I’m missing which is at least 20 because if I can show improvement to my guidance counselor as I promised, she’ll allow me to take online classes and night school and such. I know, it’s very late and it’s probably too late but I’m confident in myself and not to be arrogant but I know for a fact I’m smarter than most people. I don’t have much to offer besides a good sat grade and a really good college essay but anything helps.

Essentially this is a club that will form groups and work on projects that use technology to delve into the humanities.

I want to keep this club as open as possible (because we've all gotten rejected by project teams and it can wreck your self confidence). So, I am literally opening this up to everyone no matter what your major is (even ILR and History majors are welcome -- we need you in fact).

After receiving an offer,  I'm trying to obtain information about things that I should prepare before going and hope you guys will not mind answering them. (I'm a newbie here)  


\- Through my observation of several apartments at Ithaca, I noticed that most of them do not provide pillow/mattress/blanket. Do you have recommended places to purchase them along with kitchenware? I'm thinking of going there on my first day.  


\- How long is the process of opening a bank account and credit card? and which place is better to do so between Manhattan and Ithaca? as I have heard that Ithaca is lacking ATM machines for particular banks and it is easier to open an account with Bank of America in Manhattan before going there. Is it true?  


\- About the bank account for an international student, besides documents stated in the below link, do I need to bring anything to the bank in order to open an account along with a credit card?

[https://www.compareremit.com/money-transfer-guide/best-bank-accounts-for-international-students-in-the-usa/](https://www.compareremit.com/money-transfer-guide/best-bank-accounts-for-international-students-in-the-usa/)   


\- I read that Cornell bus which departs to Ithaca from Cornell Club at Manhattan is one of the most convenient ways to commute there but its earliest schedule is 13.30 pm while most of the arrival flights at NYC from my country will be in the morning. Therefore, is it possible to temporarily leave my luggage at Cornell Club? Do they charge any fees? or where is the usual place that students will go before getting on the bus?  


\- I don't have a laptop yet, is it ok to buy a new one there? I saw a discount for students in the Cornell store and considering purchasing Dell at Ithaca. Just worrying if students normally need to use it immediately upon arrival. (I'm worried about the warranty if I choose to buy one in my country.)

I busted my ass here in cs because I thought good grades would get me a good job. Dealt with Ithaca, utterly useless distribution requirements, mostly useless cs classes, and just general toxicity.

Now I'm moving to a place I don't wanna live for a job I don't wanna take, and my CORNELL degree had NOTHING to do with it. Nothing.

So all that time and energy spent on getting in here and then maintaining a nice GPA was a just a big fucking waste of time and money.

Lessons:
1) do not come here for cs/eng. You can get a job that's just as good at an easier school in less of a hell hole. It just isn't worth it. I wish someone told me leetcode and experience is really all that matters. 

2) life's too short. Do what makes you happy and if you're unhappy someplace, leave. If I really don't like my new job, I will leave. Time to do things that make me happy instead of sacrificing based on the bad conventional wisdom out there.

Special fuck you to cornell, academia, and to me."

Prelims are kicking my butt, I'm most certainly failing one of my classes with little room for error, and I hate being a CS major and I've just wasted my entire life doing unfulfilling things. I'm at the point where it's like my soul isn't even in my body anymore and I've even told a friend that if I died today, my life wouldn't have been worth living. I've tried CAPS and frankly, I do feel better right after the sessions, but it's always back to the same thing. Struggling to pass classes, difficult relationship with parents, lack of sleep and just feeling subpar as a person. Talking to counselors doesn't change the fact that outside of that bubble of comfort and compassionate, I'm still getting chewed up and spit out by this university. 

Every semester is a struggle to keep a good GPA and none of this comes naturally to me and I just don't feel like I belong. I never have. And CS isn't even fulfilling to me. I never wanted to major in it, my parents wanted me to. Before coming to Cornell I had a mental image of what I thought my life would be like, doing something I'd excel in and now it just feels like I'm always hanging on by the skin of my teeth. And when I graduate (IF I graduate considering my grade in a certain class), I'm just going to be relegated to a programming job I hate, at a company I'll probably hate. I've stopped actively applying to jobs and I can't be bothered to do anymore Leetcode. I'm just existing at this point and even that is starting to wear on me. And it all just makes me wonder, what's the point of it all? 

There's so many things I need to do and I try to get stuff done but it's always around this time where it's like everything ramps up and you think you'll stay ahead but honestly there's never enough hours in the day and schoolwork is my 9 to 11 on good days. This school just breaks you down in ways I didn't even know were possible and it wears on you. And all of your work culminates to tiny blips in time where you have to think under pressure in a timed environment with a multitude of distractions. Obviously a lot of people have no trouble with that. But I'm not one of them.

And I can't afford to fail this one class, both monetarily and career-wise, but this subject just doesn't make sense to me and I thought I understood it but I'm just on the outside of some inside-joke where everyone gets it and I'm just lost. I'm trying to regroup but I can't even study for this class without having a complete breakdown and fearing the possibility of failure. And the worst is approaching the professor and them telling me to drop the class because there's no hope. I just can't \*not\* graduate or I'll be the laughing stock of my family and be reminded, once again, about how much of a failure I am.

If I fail, I'll either just ghost everyone and fall off the grid somehow or kill myself. I can't spend another semester here."

I’m currently taking BIOEE 1610 and I’m...not doing well. I did poorly on the prelim, mostly because I overthought the questions and didn’t study the right stuff. Based on the syllabus, my prelim grade is roughly a C+. I took BIOEE 1780 last semester and got an A, and I was hoping that this would be similar, but it isn’t. After talking with a few friends, I learned that the fall and spring courses are completely different: different number of prelims, different grading policies, different professors, different textbook. They also said that the fall course was relatively easy. My question is, should I drop the class and take it again in the fall? It’s not that I don’t understand the material, it’s that I underestimated how hard the exam would be and misinterpreted some of the questions, so hopefully I can prepare better next time. Plus, apparently one of the prelims is dropped in the fall, so there’s that. Any advice would be very appreciated.

Thank you."

I'm currently a freshman at NYU and I'm LOVING IT! There is a lot of pressure from my parents to take the Cornell offer, since my dad went there and both of my parents care about prestige heavily.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm worried about:

\- I don't like Greek life. I think it's a stupid hierarchy and there's a cult-mentality. There's hardly any Greek life at NYU

\- Ithaca seems boring, and transitioning from living in NYC to nowhere seems like 100 to 0 too fast

\- Is Cornell academic culture toxic? I don't get that vibe at NYU because of its huge emphasis on the arts and inclusivity (which I love)

&amp;#x200B;

Why I'd transfer:

\- Cornell's GPA goes up to a 4.3 max, whereas at NYU it goes up to a 4.0 max. I want to go to law school, so the opportunity to get a higher GPA helps

\- it's the ivy league / greater prestige

\- I'd feel like i'm missing out on some sort of opportunity. WILL I BE!?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Thinking about transferring from NYU (creative, artsy, in the city) to Cornell (prestige and...ithaca....)"
