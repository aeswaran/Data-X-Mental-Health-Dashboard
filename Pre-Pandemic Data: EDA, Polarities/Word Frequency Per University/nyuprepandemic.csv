My roommates and suitemates do though. I don't want to be pushy but when they buy alcohol and drink it you can smell it from outside our room in the hallway. They just keep drinking and telling me that this is what all college students do which I doubt it. I am at my wits end and do not know what to do. They even suggested me to leave the room while they are drinking but I pay just as much as them to be here so I'm not gonna walk out of my room. I thought about going to the RA but he does not seem like he would care. I need help. Do not think I can survive a year with them."

I took a semester of Intermediate French II at my previous university, but I was told I would still have to take a placement test to determine what class to take at NYU. On the online exam I placed into the level after Intermediate II (can't remember the name), but when I took the placement exam I was told I would have to take Intermediate II again. I am currently registered for the class, and received an email from the professor with the class materials and I found that it is the SAME CHAPTERS of the SAME TEXTBOOK, with the SAME ONLINE LEARNING PROGRAM. You may guess, I am quite frustrated with this because I got an A in this class at a comparable university with the same class materials.

SO, my question is this: does anyone have a similar experience they can share? Were you able to petition the university to let a previous class count for the language requirement, or at least take the paper placement test again? Does anyone have any advice for where I could start to address this with administration?

Here are some of my questions:

\- How did the MBA/MSc prepare you for a job in the biotech field? Where were you before the program and where are you after? (or currently)

\- Was there much overlap between the two programs? Did any of your classes cover the intersection of science and business? (such as bioentrepreneurship)

\- What are the advantages/disadvantages of the dual degree program vs. a singular program such as Keck Graduate School's Masters in Business and Science degree?

\- Did the MSc Biology intefere with the MBA events/extracurriculars? (Job fairs, networking events, etc.)

Any other information that you think could be useful would be greatly appreciated!

About a week ago, I was considering taking a leave of absence, and submitted a request on Albert. I did not turn in any of the paperwork that my school (Tisch) requires, and did not even offer a reason as to why I was requesting a leave. In that time, I decided that a leave wasn't truly what I wanted, and I quickly emailed my advisor asking how to proceed in reversing the leave. She responded saying she would correspond with someone else on the next move. This was last Thursday. 

My advisor nor the person she CC'd got back to me, I (regretfully) assumed that since I didn't turn in any actual paperwork the request would likely get denied or simply wouldn't process. Flash forward to today, and my request was approved. 

I'm kind of freaking the fuck out. I'm un-enrolled from all my classes and am not able to even view my past schedule. I emailed my advisor, as well as the Registrar office, and left a voicemail for someone at Tisch to respond to, but obviously it's past 5 and no one will respond until tomorrow. 

So my big question in all of this is - am I completely fucked? Has anyone been in a situation similar to this before? To complicate things further, I am currently in housing and the prospect of getting kicked out is giving me terrible anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

PLEASE HELP!

TLDR: I requested a leave of absence on Albert, changed my mind, told my advisor, assumed we were cool. We are definitely not cool and now I am unenrolled for the Fall semester."

I've recently been looking into transferring to Steinhardt for English Education.  Not sure if my stats fit NYU's criteria but I'm willing to try and see what happens. I've got an open mind. 
  This is my last semester at Hudson County Community College in NJ , meaning I'll have my associate's degree by December.  How is it applying and transferring as a Spring transfer? What are Steinhardt's standards? Hows the program and student body?  What could I expect 

Stats:
3.57 GPA 
Some honors classes ( school doesnt have a honors program but you can graduate with honors of u take 5 honors classes. I only took 3 cause those classes never played well with my schedule but I did pretty well in them)

Extra Curricular Activities:
SKD (an English honors society)
Editor in school lit mag
Content Editor at a student start up Newsletter 
Vice President of Theatre Club

Jobs:
Tutor at writing center
After school teacher 2x a week"

What is the community like?

How would a transfer student transition into this program?

I know I could study English education basically anywhere that offers it but I want to know what makes NYU worth applying to that specific area.

What draws my attention to the school is not its razzle-dazzle of being in the city; its the appreciation for diversity and creativity along with its rigor.   Basically I'm turning the tables by asking NYU, ""why NYU?"""

MIDDLE EASTERN WOMEN 18 YEARS AND OLDER NEEDED FOR ONLINE STUDY

I am a Ph.D. candidate at Long Island University-Brooklyn and I am asking you to be a participant in my research.  This study is designed to help identify protective and risk factors that impact the psychological health of Middle Eastern/Arab American women. 

You will fill out a series of brief questionnaires.  This study will require about 45 minutes of your time.  Because the study focuses on Middle Eastern women, you are eligible to participate if you are a woman who is 18 years or older living in the United States and identify as Middle Eastern (including Arab or Arab-American from the following countries: Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen).

If you participate, you can be entered into a raffle **to win one of twenty Amazon $20 gift cards**.  Additionally, you may find the study interesting!

You will also provide information that may help clinical psychologists learn about factors that impact the psychological health of Middle Eastern women.   Research data in this area would also provide information that would facilitate the administration of culturally informed psychotherapy in this population. 

To participate, go to:

[https://survey.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_d6I6kpboGmfRjCZ](https://survey.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_d6I6kpboGmfRjCZ)

If you have friends who might be interested in participating, please tell them!

If you have questions about this research, please contact Amira Hanna at [MEWPH2019@gmail.com](mailto:MEWPH2019@gmail.com).

You can access the website from your computer at any time.  Participation is completely voluntary.

I am not interested in MS DS or MS CS (Courant) since I know I won't get in. So it is between Tandon's MS ECE and MS CS, I am leaning towards ECE as I believe it is relatively easier to get in. 

However, my coursework, projects as well as work experience are heavily ML oriented. 

So my question is how do I justify applying to ECE when:   
1. My field of interest is ML.  
2. My background is almost completely composed of programming and CS theory? I have taken a few hardware courses such as Computer Architecture, Wireless Technology and Microcontrollers and Embedded Systems as well as a couple projects but that's that. 

Won't the admissions committee think ""Why is he applying for Computer Engineering when his interest is in ML""? 

I have already checked out the program requirements as well as research and it seems like there are plenty of ECE courses (ECE-GY prefix) related to ML that an ECE student can take. Not to mention that the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering has a dedicated research area for Machine Learning while CS doesn't.  


Please note that apart from the 2 core courses, I have absolutely no intention whatsoever of taking hardware courses."

The store has been open since 1958 and has been used as a location in such shows as **“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”.** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Friday 9/20, Midnight Confessions** is a show where we ask the audience to anonymously write down a confession, true or false, and place it into a hat. The performers then take the confessions and act them out. Between confessions, we have sketches, some of the best up-and-coming musicians, and stand up comedians perform. 

I believe this is a great way for students to let off steam. I also believe this show provides a nice catharsis for students to anonymously share a secret, or their feelings about being new to the City, or the anxiety/stress they feel as a student and to have it externalized and acted out comically.

**Saturday 9/21, “Live at the Inn”**: a variety showcase with comedy, music, and live sketches. “Live at the Inn” is a welcoming space for creatives, locals, and people new to New York City to gather and share an experience.

This is a great day to share an experience with a creative community.

***Tickets are only $10 and it's BYOB.***

That ended up being totally wrong, to the point in which most of the jobs I have worked since don't even require a high school degree.

I had an okay GPA, decent internships, and have applied to thousands of jobs in the years since but I can't seem to find anything. I still volunteer regularly in the fields I am interested in to fluff my resume, but have never found work related to anything I studied. I am afraid to go back to grad school and repeat this same mistake with more debt but I am not sure what else I can do. 

Sorry for the rant, these past few years have been very emotionally taxing as I have experienced housing instability because of all this. Wasserman Center and all the ""alumni support"" has pretty much been a complete joke. I don't know what to do."

I'm really surprised and disappointed at how little Wasserman Manhattan does for CS students. Some points I noticed while focusing on getting myself hired in a new-grad position:

* On Campus Recruitment (OCR) has a negligible selection of tech firms. I signed on right at the start of recruitment season and the only big-name tech company I saw was Microsoft. MasterCard is also there but that's about it. The rest of the listings are all consulting firms or law offices. So now we need to deal with exploding offers, vague interviewing timelines, and all the other BS that goes on with recruiting when your school doesn't stand in your corner. 

* The career fair was just as bad. I could count the big name tech companies on one hand, and some of those felt like an afterthought. The Tandon career fair I've heard is much better, which is understandable. If they're not going to let us into that one, which is again understandable, at least don't schedule it for the *same exact date* so tech recruiters have a chance to visit both. 

* Handshake does nothing that public job boards don't already do. Its only purpose is to give desperate teaching nonprofits a platform to beg undergraduate students to consider them.

* The events are also lacklustre. Pretty much the same firms as OCR and the career fair, and not much is focused on tech. 

* I haven't met anybody at Wasserman Manhattan who actually knows something about the tech recruiting scene. Sure, it's nice to get my resume reviewed, but when they don't know what anything on there means it only goes so far. 

How do you all deal with this? I have very few friends graduated and working in tech that I can ask for advice/referrals from. I have no recruiters I'm communicating with because the career fair was a wash. I just feel blind and hopeless because the ""amazing job center"" we have here is utterly failing me during the critical recruitment season."

I found it difficult to find good schools to transfer to in the spring, and so far I’ve only seen NYU, UMich, Bernard, and American. I was accepted to Southern Methodist University (local) with decent aid, but I want to move away from Dallas if I can.

Do you think I have a shot? Do you think I should wait till fall so I can apply to Emory, Rice, Uchicago, Columbia like I planned? (The green card came a little after the deadlines for fall 2019) , especially since I can’t do stern for spring transfer, and I would do CAS.

I was wondering if y'all could help me decide if I should ED to NYU or my dream school--CMU. Before I start, I know my stats aren't super outstanding, but I am getting anxiety of being locked down to NYU in the very extreme case that I do get into CMU. I don't know if my situation is special or not but it is definitely complicated. The circumstance I'm under is that I studied and lived in Vietnam for 14 years (bc I'm Vietnamese), then I moved to Singapore and studied there for 2 years under their public education system. I got an O-Level grade of 10 which isn't spectacular but its good considering where I went to Singapore. I kind of lack extracurriculars in Singapore because all the students are to prioritize their focus into the O-Level Exam. I moved over to the US mid-year Junior year, so my Quarter 1 grades are missing from my GPA. Moreover, my school wouldn't add my grades from Singapore so my GPA isn't the actual GPA until the colleges I'm applying to do the calculations. I am doing the best I can right now at a competitive school and trying to use my senior year to boost my GPA. I hope y'all can help. Thank you! 

Here are my stats:

GPA (unweighted): 3.67 (not my actual GPA since I moved from Singapore to the USA and the school didn't consider my grades from my school in Singapore. 

SAT: 1420 

O-Level Grade: 10 (O-Level is like A-Level but for Sophomore Kids, it's much like a high school diploma over here. It is a national exam that over 80000 kids in Singapore take in order to continue their higher education)

Extracurriculars: 

\- Student council (Freshman and Sophomore Year in Singapore) (Kinda like class council)

\- Person-In-Charge of Robotics Club (Freshman and Sophomore Year)

\- Member of Executive Committee of Student Council (Sophomore Year) (So I was in charge of an aspect of the student council and oversaw the members in that group)

\- Participated in SASMO (Singapore Asian School Mathematics Olympiad) 

\- Participated in Research Competition at a Local Polytechnic (Singapore)

\- Participated in National Robotics Programming Competition (Singapore)

\- Did a summer research program at NYU (researching in fluid dynamics) 

\- Currently working with a professor from NYU working on research for fluid dynamics."

I am currently in my junior year and am majoring in economics. My plan is to follow through with a PhD in said subject.

From what I have heard, one needs good research experience to make a good PhD application. I sort of have had no luck in this aspect. I have a good GPA, and from what I have seen, I can do the work most employers could ask for. The problem is in that I suspect that I haven’t networked much. 

Until now, my idea was that I would look for professors announcing vacancy through some medium in the department. However, I have found literally no such vacancy notices in the economics department. In fact, all other but professors from economics department post on NYU Job Search portal. 

Of course, there can be some very straightforward explanation to this, but I refuse to believe that NYU’s economics department doesn’t open its doors to undergrads for relevant research experience. 

If anyone has any relevant information that may help me out in landing a part time research assistant spot, I would be highly grateful.

Like don’t get me wrong I get it. When you get the email you go pick it up, but it almost seems they wouldn’t have even given me the email if I didn’t go there, and sometimes I NEED what I purchased for my projects.

I have been struggling with some weekend slumps this year, meaning that I have had multiple weekends where I did nothing and never left my dorm.

The people in my building have been pretty uninviting and I haven't spoken or really seen anyone on my floor. I joined some clubs I was interested in but it seems they only meet on weekdays.

I am a CS major and Japanese minor who enjoys both of those things, as well as video games, astronomy, drawing and painting, anime, travel, and photography. I'm trying to use OrgSync but I am having a bit of trouble finding anything and the site itself is a tad annoying to navigate.

I've read the threads and I will not bore/annoy you with the common ""what it takes to transfer"" questions. Though I am looking for some insight on the open mindedness of admission faculty of NYU (NYU Stern specifically). I am a CC student, busting my butt to meet requirements and to create an exceptional resume (for being a 24 year old that is now finally invested in an education) for a chance at transferring to NYU Stern. My situation is a bit unique because I have had quite the... life. When it comes down to life experience and the discussion of such in the application and admissions process, how may the school feel about a potential student that has been working in an ""alternative"" field? Lets call it exotic dancing. 

Thanks!"

I am a senior in high school applying as a film major and NYU is my top choice. I was hoping to get some feedback and tips on my portfolio! I have a 3.7 gpa weighted, 3.5 unweighted, and got a 30 on my act. I am still working on the short story, here is one of them if anyone has feedback:

The Search for Josephine
“Let’s keep looking,” the lieutenant urged. “This could be our biggest bust and you want to just give up?” Florence Valmonte was the only female detective in her department, and because of this she agreed to continue her search, even though she knew it meant risking everything. 
    Four years earlier, when Valmonte was exactly twenty-three years, seven months, and fourteen days old, she had the worst day of her life. It started out just like any other day, a cold shower to wake up, and a stroll to her internship at the local police station. Only on this day, she decided to stop at the coffee shop, lured by the scent of freshly baked chocolate croissants. She was not one to fall victim to the donut stereotype. As she walked through the door, she saw the most beautiful woman. Florence would describe her as captivating, worldy, uncomparable. As a reliable narrator, I will tell you she was average… a brunette, a couple inches taller than most with large grey eyes. Florence had never felt this way about another woman before, and she watched like a lion stalking its prey. The woman rose from her seat when the barista called out, “Josephine! I have your mocha.” Josephine. Florence locked eyes with her, and for a moment time was still. 
    Their first kiss was just hours later. Up until this moment, Florence had never felt nervous in her life. She was relentlessly brave. After her internship, they met in Washington Square Park. A pianist was playing a graceful tune underneath the arch, which lit their hearts simultaneously as they held hands. Josephine, having done this many times before, made the first move. She leaned in, only to be pushed away. 
“I’m sorry. This is just new to me.”
“It’s okay,” Josephine understood. “We can take it slow.”
Florence shook her head at the ground with disapproval, and turned back to Josephine, grabbing her by the face and kissing her in a sudden motion. It felt incredibly reckless to kiss someone she barely knew. Florence was also aware that some moments are worth any consequences they create. And this kiss would certainly create a whirlwind of troubles she could never escape. 
    That night, Florence woke up to the ringing of her work phone. Her boss at the station was requesting her after the news that the dealer they had been tracking, Brancos, was murdered. As an intern, Florence had filed a lot of the paperwork for the Brancos investigation and knew all the ins and outs of the case. As she stumbled into the office at 11:44pm, what she saw had her paralyzed in shock. Pinned to the board was the main suspect of the murder… Josephine. 
“Who is that?” The room turned to face Florence, surprised those were the first words she spoke.
“This is the girl we are after. Her name is Josephine Bauers, also known as Brancos’ wife,” The lieutenant revealed. “We think she killed him.”
Florence was shocked. Hurt. Speechless. None of this made any sense. 
“Why would she do that?” Another officer questioned, skeptical.
“Well, we found these. Two fake ID’s with their photos and the names Sara and Jonathon Cridell printed on them. Before we summoned you, Valmonte, we made a few phone calls to local banks, and surely enough, just fifteen minutes after his stabbing, this ‘Sara Cridell’ deposited ten grand from their savings in cash, and transferred another two million into a seperate account. We’re running the numbers now.”
    Florence felt her heart racing and was certain everyone else in the room could hear it. She excused herself, slammed the door behind her, and ran to grab the nearest trash bin, hurling out her shock and dismay. Even if the theory was false, she had been lied to. Maybe even used as an in to the investigation. How could she have trusted so easily. 
    Four years and three promotions later, Florence Valmonte agreed to return to the Brancos investigation with much hesitation. As she left the lieutenant’s office, she had a sinking feeling this was a terrible idea. But so much was on the line. 
    Her search began the next morning by the waterfront. The dense fog limited her vision to what was just in front of her. She knew if Josephine were in town it would be by boat, as it was the only way she could travel safely overseas. Everyone in the country was looking for this dangerous woman. Florence however, felt this woman was not a threat. In fact, in the four years it had been since they last met, her feelings had not faded. She tried to move on, meet other people, put the stint with the devil behind her. But it was as if Josephine never escaped her. She was always there; a lingering reminder of the sinner Florence truly was. She had lied. Told the lieutenant she had never seen her before, had no idea of her whereabouts. The truth would come out about their relationship, and it would ruin Florence’s life. But we aren’t there yet…
    We are here. 7:15am. Still waiting. As the time passed her hope dissipated. She had no other leads. Just instinct, an almost magnetic draw towards the docks. Naturally, Florence would see it as fate that just an hour and thirty-six minutes after her arrival, as the fog began to clear, she saw her.
    “Josephine!” She called out in desperation, rising from the bench. She sprinted in the direction of the figure, with no proof it was truly her. Just that feeling again. The same feeling from the past one-thousand, four-hundred and sixty-seven days before, every time she had thought of Josephine. As she approached the figure it turned to face her. Now, short black hair, skin pale from a life of hiding, but those same sparkling grey eyes. 
“I was on my way.” Josephine smiled softly.
Confused, Florence asked, “Where?” 
“To Washington Square arch.”
    With a sudden wave of compulsion, Florence dove into a kiss. She knew it was the very last thing she should be doing. But some moments are worth the consequences.
    As the weeks passed, Josephine explained everything. The marriage, the murder, the disappearance. Not all of her reasons were acceptable, in fact, most of us would say they were the opposite. But Florence understood every word. Her husband was abusive, trapped her in a marriage and threatened to take her down with him if she ever revealed his identity. She wanted freedom and saw only one way of achieving it.
      Florence made a promise she wasn’t sure she could keep. She would hide Josephine and find another lead to throw the case. She did exactly this—  bringing forth every associate, employee, and customer of Brancos— most of whom had already been questioned and cleared. To the best of her knowledge, the plan worked, and the search for Josephine was dropped. 
    Then came light. By summer, they were engaged to be married. They spent the month of June by the beach and fell into a deep love. Secrets were revealed. Florence began to take part in criminal activity led by Josephine, who had taken over her dead ex-lover’s business. As the days passed, Florence became numb to the sins of her lover. Distant from her surroundings. During her time with Josephine she had learned to let go and drift where the water carried her. It was true, sometimes the consequences are worth the moments they create. And sometimes they are not. For that night, out on the water, a gun went off. Distant sirens followed. Josephine Bauers was dead. 

There is also a “tell us about yourselfie” aspect now where you record a 1-2 minute video about yourself. There are no other parameters other than to be creative. I am considering doing an Elle Woods Harvard Admissions Video parody, but that idea might be too silly. Please let me know what you think! Any advice would be helpful."

Recently I have received complaints about the frequency of ‘chance me’ posts and suggestions to ban them from this subreddit. I personally agree because

* An application is a wholistic process and we can’t see everything you submit
* We don’t actually know what standards the admissions office uses and what they care about, we just have anecdotal evidence which often isn't the best
* NYU's admission rate drops every year and standards go up, so even the anecdotal evidence we do have may not translate well to this year's applications

For this reason I was seeking community input in regards to the following:

* Should 'chance me' posts be banned from the sub? Application questions, advice and help will still be **allowed**, but posts explicitly asking what someone's chances of getting into NYU are would not.
* If individual 'chance me' posts are banned, should I make a megathread? Should this megathread be stickied?"

I tried in August connecting mine wirelessly to the NYU network. It kept giving me a bunch of different error codes saying it couldn't connect even after I registered it online. I don't remember the exact codes but it said stuff about not being able to connect to the network and something about the DHCP server. I emailed IT and they told me Xboxes couldn't connect wirelessly because of something either with the device or with NYU wifi restrictions - I don't remember their exact wording. 

IT told me I needed an Ethernet cable, which I wasn't able to set up until today. I connected the Ethernet cable and when I go to Xbox network settings it says that I have a wired connection. But it won't let me use the network at all. If I try to login to my account it says ""you need Internet to do this."" When I go to ""test network connection"" it says that I need to authenticate my device or something to join this network (note that this is a different error code than the one I received when trying to connect wirelessly). When I click ""authenticate"" it takes me to the nyu-media device registration site. I go through the entire process of putting the information in and it will say it's registered, but still never connect. It just says at the bottom of the screen ""this page will close once you are connected."" However it never closes, no matter how long I wait. Restarting doesn't help even after I've registered the device and waited several minutes. I am able to connect my wifi to my phone's hotspot so I'm fairly confident the issue is not with my XBOX, and instead is something with the NYU network.

I'm also making this because I am trying to decide whether to apply to Tisch or Steinhardt for musical theatre. I will compare them below. Based on what I've read online, I'd say that: 

***Steinhardt...***

* is singing-based, offering more vocal training and less acting/dancing training than Tisch
* also trains musical theatre majors in classical singing, allowing them to be experienced enough to audition for Broadway or opera companies 
* accepts less people than Tisch, but their applicant pool is much smaller than Tisch's
* usually has better quality productions than Tisch
* more camaraderie between students
* has less alumni on Broadway, but has less alumni in general due to consistently being a smaller program

&amp;#x200B;

***Tisch....***

* is acting-based, offering more acting and slightly more dance training and less vocal training
* has more industry-professionals teaching
* accepts more people than Steinhardt, but has a much larger applicant pool
* has worse productions than Steinhardt, grad students get priority in casting
* students develop a more independent attitude, which can be helpful for transitioning to NYC life and pursuing an acting career after graduation
* has more alumni working on Broadway, but has more alumni in general due to consistently being a larger program

This is essentially all I've been able to find on the topic. If the information I have stated is no longer true or never was true, please forgive and correct me. I want accurate info, obviously. If there is any more info that would be helpful, I'd appreciate it. Would you say one is definitively better over the other, or are they just different?"

Some friends of mine are running a BYOB variety show this Friday and Saturday and would love for you to come!

Both shows are in the heart of Greenwich Village at New York’s oldest still-operating record store: The Music Inn. The store has been open since 1958 and has been used as a location in such shows as “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”.

TONIGHT! Friday 10/18, Midnight Confessions is a show where we ask the audience to anonymously write down a confession, true or false, and place it into a hat. The performers then take the confessions and act them out. Between confessions, we have sketches, some of the best up-and-coming musicians, and stand up comedians perform.

This is a great way for students to let off steam. I also believe this show provides a nice catharsis for students to anonymously share a secret, or their feelings about being new to the city, or the anxiety/stress they feel as a student and to have it externalized and acted out comically.

Saturday 10/19, “Live at the Inn”: a variety showcase with comedy, music, and live sketches. Tomorrow's show will be a classic Who-Dun-It Murder Mystery! 

For each show:

Tickets are only $10 and it's BYOB.

Address: 169 West 4th St, New York, NY

Doors open at 8:30pm Show starts at 9pm. Get there early for a good seat.

Trains: 1 to Christopher St.

A, C, D, F, M to West 4th St. NJ Transit is just a few blocks away.

**Banning of chance me posts**
After a series of complaints, I asked for community input on what to do with chance me threads. Following almost unanimous opinions, posts by applicants asking what their chances of getting into NYU are now *banned*. A new mega thread will be created, and linked to on the side bar. /Note: other kinds of admissions posts, including tips, info and help are still allowed/

**Sidebar refresh**
A user suggested we refresh our sidebar. We want to include university resources and other links which are of frequent use, or will reduce posts with frequently asked questions. *Please leave your suggestions* for things to include in comments to this post!

**Post moderation**
In general, we want to avoid having to remove posts and doing blanket bans. In cases like spam, rule-breaking or chance me posts like now (lol) we will have to step in and remove posts, but we hope that in general all of you will use upvotes and downvotes to regulate what you want to see more and less of! *Use your vote*

We appreciate your interest in NYU! Feel free to ask questions about the school and the application process in this post!

Do take advice about your chances of admission with a grain of salt:
* An application is a wholistic process and we can’t see everything you submit
* We don’t actually know what standards the admissions office uses and what they care about, we just have anecdotal evidence which often isn't the best
* NYU's admission rate drops every year and standards go up, so even the anecdotal evidence we do have may not translate well to this year's applications

Short summary: The woman will confront the man on his actions. He comes home late at night consistently. The man avoids the questions, this leads to the woman raising her voice, which results in one bout of violence. He tries to console her after and leave a ring for her in the morning.

My grades aren’t very good, they’re decent (3.5 gpa average )but compared to most applicants who have a 4.0&lt; gpa and take all these AP classes they’re obviously not that impressive. I am an international applicant so my school doesn’t even offer AP classes obviously lol. But I do have plenty of impressive extracurriculars, awards, etc. and I am good at writing essays. I also am decent at taking standardized tests. From your personal experience, did you feel like NYU cared more about your grades and scores, or did the other parts of your application matter a lot??

when a finite number 1 = a non-finite number 0.999.. then maths ends in contradiction

another way

1 is an integer a whole number

0.888... is a non-integer it is not a whole number

0.999... is a non-integer not a whole number

when a integer 1 =a non-integer 0.999... maths ends in contradiction

2)1)Darwins book is called On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection ....

but

this paper shows natural selection is not the origin of new species Natural selection is not the origin of new species

Natural selection does not generate new genes/species Natural selection adds no new genetic information as it only deals with the passing on of genes/traits already present and it will be pointed out genetics cannot account for

the generation of new species/genes as it is claimed the generation of new genes [via mutation] is a random process due to radiation, viruses, chemicals etc and genetic cannot account for these process happening as they are out side the scope of genetics physics, chaos theory etc may give some explanation but genetics cant

2) Biologist cant tell us what a species is -without contradiction thus evolution theory ie evolving species is nonsense

Biologists agree there is species hybridization

but that contradicts what a species is

3) biologist tell us they investigate life

but

they cant tell us what life is-they can tell us what life does but cant tell us what life is they cant even give a definition of life that is not nonsense"

Would my GPA and ACT score necessarily matter as much as it would with other schools when applying for music comp? My GPA isn’t bad by any means, but I’m just curious how these two things would play out when applying.

I also noticed that one of the audition requirements were “Three or four scores of original works in different instrumentation and style”. What exactly are they looking for? Is different instrumentation required for each score? Being a band kid, I’ve composed mainly wind ensemble compositions and arrangements.

Additionally, what should I look out for in general as someone who wishes to apply to this program?

First let me say that ALL information relating to CS electives is appreciated, even if it's not directly answering one of my questions. Also that I have already read similar posts in the past on this subreddit, but am looking for more opinions.

For context, I study CS and Math and am looking to work in Data Science (so the extent to which each elective pertains to Data Science is a particularly useful piece of information!!). Also helpful is the difficulty of the classes and how interesting they are, and how good the professors are.

&amp;#x200B;

1. What are the primary differences between AI (Ernest Davis) and Machine Learning (Kyunghun Cho)? I am in AI right now and planning on taking ML next semester, but am unsure if there's is enough new material to justify taking ML.
2. What are the primary differences between Numerical Analysis (in math dpt., Charles Puelz) and Numerical Computing (CS, Margaret Wright)? Do people recommend these classes overall?
3. Is Natural Language Processing (Adam Meyers) interesting? I have a sense of its difficulty level but people don't seem to say a lot about how interesting the actual material is. Also, having taken AI (Ernest Davis) and Data Management (Joe Versoza), I am concerned that there might be a lot of repeat here also. Is the natural language side of things emphasised enough to make this course sufficiently novel?
4. Any other info on any electives please!!!!

Thanks so much for reading my long post. All info is appreciated :)

Also if anyone wants to ask me about AI or Data Management, feel free."

So I did the student exchange program in Japan last year, since we dont have an actual campus not many people do it, so theres not a lot of precedent for HOW to do it. More specifically im the first comp sci student to do it as far as I know

So flash back two years ago before I go, and im discussing with my cs advisor on how to make this work, and I ask him about replacing a cs elective with a math class to get ahead before I go, he gives me the A ok.

Now, once I finally get IN to Japan, I start giving him my syllabi for class approvals and its at this point when im ALREADY THERE that he tells me that I can only get credit for two electives. Im annoyed as hell, but it doesnt completely fuck my schedule, so I let it go.

Fast forward to today, and as im emailing him to get my registration clearance he happens to say ""By the way, three of your electives need to be taken in the cs department"" as in, the calc substitution I had taken earlier was getting pushed out by the classes i took in Japan. 

Your initial reaction may be, well duh, cant take too many ourside classes. Thats what i thought at first too, but I went through this with mt advisor, he approved my plan, amd has had SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES to tell me this as ive communicated with him and he only chooses to do so 4 days before I register for my last semester. Now I potentially wont graduate on time, or will at least have a hellish last semester.

I guess what Im asking is, do you think I have grounds to push back on this? I tried my best to plan this with him and hes been wholly unhelpful for years (I have a twenty five email long back and forth with him where I have to keep asking him just to answer basic questions) and I dont think its my fault that Im here now. Do you think I should try and go over his head, and if so who would I talk to? I dont think they even have a real ""exchange program process"" im pretty sure they just made it up as they went. Feels like I just stumbled into something theyre not prepared for and thats not mt fault.

TL;DR I kinda feel like my advisor fucked me over and Im wondering if I should go over his head to fight him on it."

The occasion they cite for the publication of this project is the 400th anniversary of the arrival of 20 African slaves at Port Comfort, Virginia.

The Times project raises the question: Is race the driving force of history, as the Times insists? Or, as Karl Marx analyzed, is it class? Is “anti-black racism … in the very DNA of this country” as the Times writes? Or is the history of the United States fundamentally the history of class struggle? As social inequality reaches record levels, is America heading toward race war or socialist revolution?

The promotion of the 1619 Project takes place under conditions of expanding class struggle internationally and a growing interest in socialism among workers and youth in the United States. Its aim is to block the development of a united movement of workers across all races by cultivating racial divisions.

This meeting will refute the historical falsifications advanced in the 1619 Project, explain their underlying political motivations and present the strategy for socialist revolution in America today.

In the spring, I’m planning on taking econometrics and a 300 level elective as my final courses to finish my Econ program. I’m in the policy track, and the 300 I want to take is Political Economy, which is labeled (T) for theory on Albert.

 It’s not the end of the world to take one of the other electives not labeled (T) but I’m more interested in political economy than any of the other 300 electives. 

Do any former or current Econ majors know whether or not I can use this to satisfy the 300 level requirement or is it reserved solely for those doing the theory track?

Thanks!"

I have a bit of an unusual request related to my own research and Master's thesis. First of all, allow me to quickly introduce myself. I study at Leiden University in the Netherlands and am currently writing my Master's thesis in Public Administration. I research the crowding in - crowding out framework of welfare states regarding civil society behaviour. Essential to my research is the so-called World Giving Index, which is a framework by the British Charity CAF that tries to measure philanthropic efforts all over the world. They utilize data provided by Gallup, stemming from their World Poll. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the issue. We do not have access to the Gallup World Poll and I am pretty much stuck without their microdata - also I was not able to get access via my previous jobs. I know that NYU has campus-wide access to the database (at least that's what it says on Gallup's website). I am looking for someone who could spare an hour to go over the data with me, extract them and send them to me - it should be fairly quick. Please feel free to PM me or answer in this thread. I would really appreciate the help. Why NYU? Well to be honest I have very fond memories of NYC and have always found the people to be very helpful in their own wholesome way when I lived there. I will make sure to show some form of German-Dutch-American appreciation!

Best, Seb"

I'll be going to university in the **UK** (**I'm Bulgarian**) in September of next year. I've already applied and been accepted into 4 of the 5 unis I picked (accepted in **York, Surrey, Sheffield, Leeds,** waiting on response from **Southampton**, but I'm 99% sure I'll get an offer).  


I want to study **CompSci** and since my end goal is working in the US. I want to use a MSc to jumpstart that (Visa, getting 3 years to work in the US post graduation so I've more shots at winning the visa lottery + I imagine a US degree is more desirable to US employers).  


I'll most likely end up working through uni in a pathetic attempt to save up enough to get out without any financial aid (one of the reasons I'm going to the UK, is that while my parents are well off by Bulgarian standards - big house, luxury SUV, they can in no way afford the 9.25K GBP + cost of living in the UK, let alone the 77K + cost of living in NYC, so I'll most likely either work to pay for uni in the UK or get a loan, and they'll provide the accommodation, etc.), or at least a minimal amount of debt, maybe get accepted to NYU and get absolutely obliterated by the monstrosity the living cost + college cost are.

Really hope the UK BSc can land me a decently paying job (even 60K will be a godsend, I'll get 3 roommates and live in Alphabet city to save on rent lol) so I can at least cover cost of living and put away cash for the debt I'm about to pick up thanks to NYU, without being on the verge of homelessness.

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck me the debt will be **crippling** even if I work while studying.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm wondering is, what's the best way to get accepted into NYU? I've got straight As, will do anything in my power to graduate from uni with a BSc w/ Hons, but I'm unsure which university to pick - which one of the five is more highly regarded in the US? From what I've looked up, Southampton, Leeds and Sheffield are the best out the 5 and all rank within the top 100, but I'm hoping to get some input from people who've actually gone/are in NYU - hopefully maybe an international student who took my route?  


Tl;dr: I'm Bulgarian, going to study CompSci in the UK. End goal is working in the US. Out of these 5, which is the most highly regarded in the US/will grant me the best chance of getting into NYU - Southampton, Leeds, Sheffield, Surrey, York?  


Thanks in advance :)"

1) Do these ""prereq classes"" need to be fulfilled by CAS students eventually as well? If so, is the only difference that they have the freedom to choose when they fulfill them?

2) How is the transition between LSP to CAS Econ + CS? Is the program worse off for STEM/Math related majors? Am I still able to do the double degree within CAS or do I have to choose just one?

1.  What are the differences between The Liberal Studies Core Program and Global Liberal Studies Program? How do I know which one I'm in?
2. How flexible is LSP when choosing classes, and is the program especially good for students who still don't know what to major in?
3. I will be spending my first year away at a global site. Is it true that it's harder to find and make friends at the global sites because classes are a lot smaller?
4. Where will I be staying (housing) once I return to NYC during my second year?
5. Does LSP award class credits for AP test exam scores of 4 or higher? 
6. Will all the courses I'm taking for the first two years be very similar to those in other NYU schools (mostly General Education courses)? I've heard people say LSP courses are easier; are the classes not as academically rewarding/rigorous/insightful? 
7. If I know what major I want early on, will I be able to take courses that fulfill the graduation requirements for that major? Will failing to do so prevent me from graduating in 4 years?
8. What's the process of declaring a major at CAS, Steinhardt, Stern, and Tisch after I finish the program? I know there's an application for the latter two schools, and I'm wondering if LSP students get priority acceptance to these schools? I'm undecided about my major and I'm concerned that I won't be able study the major I want once I've made my mind.
9. There seems to be a notion that LSP students are students who barely got in, and are therefore less intelligent/qualified to attend NYU. This statement is disheartening, and I just want to know how prevalent this perspective is held by other students? 
10. in your opinion, Best/worst part about LSP?

However, ECs are heavily geared towards business: started an incorporation with 16,000 sales six fig annual revenue -- 450k followers on ig -- interns @ media company with a snapchat story with over 2 million daily viewers -- production manager at a museum, creates 1,000 products for retail and museum showcase, manages 10+ employees -- intern at a science museum -- leader &amp; founded 2 clubs @ my school -- sports team 

Not sure if I should shoot my shot and apply to stern, although I know the pool for ED2 stern is probably gonna be all ivy rejects with killer stats. Or should I apply to ECON or LSP, work my ass off, then transfer to stern???? I'm aware the transfer process is crazy competitive. Has anyone had any success transferring from econ/LSP to stern?

My ultimate goal is to end up at stern since I want to work in IB or chain supply/logistics management. 

I'm extremely conflicted right now, and I don't know what to choose. Anyone have any advice?

I was directed to the 'Fall and Spring in New York' part of NYU's website, which seems to be the same thing as Visiting student. 
What I'm wondering is if anyone has ever been in this sort of situation where they want to take courses across departments as a visiting student, whether it was difficult to get into classes, and how the experience overall was. Would it be better to apply as a non-degree student and be limited to one department? Any tips or pointers would be appreciated!"

So, I thought it would be a better idea to apply for CAS Mathematics. It’s Stern, so, supposedly, campus experience and quality of education will be better, especially campus life, considering it is the main campus of NYU. 

Yet again, with my SAT(1490) and GPA 3.9 UW I would have a better shot at Tandon. Also, considering how competitive Stern is, I might even get straight up rejection for CAS.


Which major, do you think, would be a better shot for me?

I was waitlisted (yes, waitlisted, not deterred) from LS this past week and have been pondering whether or not to accept the offer.
Just gonna list some various thoughts
- While LS definitely had a bit of what I wanted, I won’t lie by saying part of the reason I applied there was because it was on the easier side of nyu schools (Again, I still liked LS enough to where I would have been fine going there)
- my 2nd choice school (GW) has an EDII option, and in all honesty they offer exactly what I want in terms of major (political communication). I also think I have a better shot of getting in there than with NYU
- I genuinely don’t know if I could stomach waiting 5 months at the minimum to hear back. I have some problems with anxiety and the mere deadline to decision wait this past fall was a lot for me
- I also don’t think I’d have a great shot at getting in off the waitlist, especially considering NYU historically isn’t the kindest with that
Essentially, I’m leaning towards not accepting the waitlist offer. I know anything can happen. I know there’s no real reason not to. But I don’t know if I wanna commit to this place further than I have cause I’m just sort of out of it right now. Is there any strong reason I should or shouldn’t go for it?

I have received about 5k in non loan money. Looking at my credit evaluation, I'm projected to graduate in the spring of 2022. I would be doing 5 semesters at NYU if I were to take a normal courseload and not fuck it up somehow.

I studied a double major in English and art history at my current university, and took a semester off on medical leave. If I went to Gallatin, I would want to study more in STEM fields and integrate that into my major, something that I have wanted to do for a while but couldn't because the rigor of the classes at my current university kind of make it impossible. I have very little debt since I went to a state school. I have worked freelance a bit and gotten a journalism internship, but I wanted Gallatin because I want to explore more of what's out there for me.

The cost is giving me some anxiety about whether or not this would be worth it. I'm already flexible about the idea of working off most of the smaller loans as I go and even being an RA or commuting from my home in LI if needed for a few semesters, but I want to know if any current NYU students think this is feasible. I also want to know if it's possible to graduate from Gallatin a semester early or if I need a reality check and I'm not even graduating in 2022. 

I know this decision is pretty personal and no one can tell me ""yes, go"" or ""no don't"" and decide for me, but I want to be prepared for what comes if I choose to attend. 

Any thoughts?"

Is this really necessary.

Has the school's financial aid policy changed? If so, then since the ED1 applicants have already received so much aid, what are my chances for meet-need financial aid during ED2?  


I'm listing my contribution at 40k.  


Thank you so much for the help."

So I'm obviously using a throwaway account because one of the cheaters is my friend. So yesterday we took our final exam for Macroeconomics and I was sitting next to two women who were cheating. They were whispering the answers to each other. Since they had different papers, they would cheat by asking the each other general questions like what's the formula for price markup/rule of thumb pricing?  It was more like one of them was giving answers and the other one was asking. The one that was giving the answers had the highest grade on the midterm. I don't even know how they didn't get caught. There were multiple TAs walking around to make sure people don't cheat. I only know the names of one of them. 

This class will be curved. 

I searched the NYU subreddit for situations of cheating and I read that an NYU professor was harmed financially for reporting cheating. I also read the academic misconduct policies and apparently professors have to PROVE that a student is cheating.

Should I report this? Is this really worth the struggle? If so, how? I don't want only one to get in trouble while the other gets off."

2. Is 32 GB of RAM overkill or is 16GB more than adequate.
3. Is Bootcamp/Parallels a stable and usable solution for whatever software needs to be run? Particularly something like Solidworks which I'm sure there is no native Mac version.

I am no moderator but I have been pretty active on this subreddit for the last year and a half or so and believe I may be able to vocalize some concerns I have personally experienced and what I see other users complain about. We attend the largest private university in the United States as well as one of the most globally spread and it's quite discouraging that our subreddit is relatively inactive amongst our current students and bombarded by redundant and easily answerable questions by prospective students. Here are some changes I suggest:

1. **New Mods:** The change first needs to come from the people able to make the change – the moderators. Most of the moderators, however, seem to have gone inactive due to having graduated or other reasons. I have only seen u/mrmbuceta be active in recent months and I applaud them for doing what they can, especially during the stressful Tandon semester. With more mods, the sub may not have to always rely on u/mrmbuceta to see the post or other users reporting ChanceMe's and admissions questions for action to be taken.
2. **A new sidebar**: Whether a prospective student or a new redditor, it can always be helpful to have NYU-specific information regarding the rules and function of this subreddit. A new sidebar would hopefully prevent the need for more work to be done by the mods. A sidebar such as the one sported by r/uchicago or r/rutgers may be informative to new and old members, directing prospective students to more relevant subreddits to them, including r/ApplyingToCollege and r/ChanceMe, thus avoiding the need to remove questions that belong there.
3. **Post flairs**: Post flairs would work to organize and categorize posts as news, school-specific inquiries, memes, and more.

Please let me know if I missed anything that you would like to add or remove and I will do my best to do so!"

1330 SAT (710/620) My math score is garbage and its due to some earlier stuff (kinda had to teach myself the 8th + 9th grade while traveling, skipped a lot of simple, yet fundamental pre algebra stuff and some algebra I material that I tried to study for but turns out learning and implementing two years worth of work in 4 months of prep will not result in much improvement). GPA is good, EC's good, not really what I'm here to talk about so moving onto

AP SCORES (Junior Year) 

APUSH - 5  

English Lang - 5 

Physics I - 3 

\+ takin another 5 ap's this year. 

I was suped with my AP Scores. They were the highest in my grade, with 4/30 kids passing the physics exam (all of which took pre-calc at the time, I took Algebra II because human trash ig). There will be other kids from my school applying to NYU, so maybe this comes to my advantage?? Idk man. 

Basically I would like to submit my AP scores instead of the SAT. I know people on here are encouraging applicants NOT to submit a 3, but considering the rigor of the class itself and its pass rate, do you think it might be better than the SAT? 

Intended major is a double, music and physics (heh, ik) in case that clarifies anything."

I was wondering whether my \*planned\* Freshman courses work well, before speaking to my academic advisor later this spring (Stern '24).  

Freshman Fall:

\- Commerce and Culture (4 credit)

\- Microeconomics (4 credit)

\- Statistics for Business Control &amp; Regression/Forecasting Models (6 credit)

\- Pop/Jazz Saxophone (2 or 4 credit)

\- Cohort Leadership Program (Pass/Fail)

&amp;#x200B;

Freshman Spring:

\- Principles of Financial Accounting (4 credit)

\- Business and Society (4 credit)

\- Some class for Texts &amp; Ideas (4 credit) - any recommendations?

\- Some class for Cultures &amp; Contexts or Global Cultures (4 credit) - any recommendations?

&amp;#x200B;

I also have a few questions.  I would be extremely grateful if anyone who has experience with these courses could respond!

1. Is the workload too much for either semesters, and if so, should I switch some of the courses around?  I'm mainly unsure whether Micro + Stats is too much in the fall.  If I do switch Micro or Stats to Spring, then I'll have to do financial accounting with micro OR stats.
2. Any recommendation for Liberal Arts Core courses or electives where it's manageable to get an A?  I'm willing to put in the work for an A to boost my GPA, as the Stern curve might slightly ruin my overall GPA.
3. According to IB Credit, I can place out of the Math Requirement (Calculus I) and Natural Science Elective (Chemistry), so I don't need to take these requirements in liberal arts core and I will receive elective credit instead?
4. Anything else I should be aware of?  Stern classes, professors, elective courses etc?

 

Thanks in advance!"

I’m pretty lucky because my parents are giving me $125k for college, but with just undergrad being at least $320k before student loan interest it still leaves me at around $200k in debt. It’s my dream school and it’s just hard to have to think about letting it go for financial reasons because I’ve worked so hard for it. On the other hand though I’m not sure if possibly being in debt for a good amount of my adult life is worth it. I’m  pretty sure I can get some scholarships but I’m not sure if I can get close to the amount I need in them. So I’m at the point where I’m having to weigh what the benefits of going would be. I’m also considering Northeastern and Boston U but I’m not sure if I’ll even get in and if going there vs NYU will make a huge difference in opportunities. I’m also considering if I should go somewhere else for undergrad and then try for grad school at NYU. 

Sorry for the long post it’s just getting close to the time I have to make my decision and I’m still really unsure what to do. So if anyone has any advice for affording NYU or maybe how I should approach this that would be great!

BA @ CAS: Includes a broader range of classes, more freedom of choice for courses

I had a few questions about the school, and if anyone could please take the time to answer a few of these questions, I would be very grateful. Thanks!!

 1) How challenging would you say classes are?   
2) How do social gatherings occur? The nontraditional ""campus"" has me wondering how and when kids get together in NYC and if there are locations where you are bound to find kids congregated during, before, or after school hours.  
3) I've heard very little about the Stern curve and I was wondering what exactly it was?  
4) How do clubs and activities work - in that - how prevalent are they, and how many people do you know attend clubs after school?  
5) What is the work load like as a Stern undergrad? Does it allow for socializing after school?  
9) Does the vastness of New York City make attending NYU daunting? I know this is subjective and varies depending on prior exposure to urban cities, but I was wondering from your perspective, what you thought.   
10) I understand that NYU in general is rather expensive and with an EFC of around 20k, the 60k I'd be expected to pay at NYU poses a challenge. Is it worth taking on this burden if I get in? Further, are the job opportunities and networking possibilities of Stern comparable to other similar, cheaper schools (UVA, UMich, USC)?

Happy new year everyone! Hope 2020 is a successful and enjoyable year for you all :) The survey I mentioned [in my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/eglhpt/the_state_of_this_subreddit_a_brief_survey/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) was up for just over 4 days and these were the **results**:

* **33** responses → n&gt;30 ∴ survey is statistically significant
* **94%** said there **is** a need to curb the number of applications posts → New rules will be implemented to this end.
* **88%** said applications posts should only be allowed as comments in the pinned megathread. **75%** said we should ban posts that can be easily answered with a FAQ section, **44%** posts that have been previously answered, **75%** posts about specific topics → We will *not* ban posts that have been previously answered, both because of the low support for the idea and because of the challenge that enforcing that rule would implicate. We will implement some form of every other ban listed above.
* **52%** said we should have a sidebar AND a wiki, **33%** just a sidebar, **6%** just a wiki, and **9%** neither → We will make both a sidebar and a wiki over the next few weeks. I will be in touch with people who left their username in the survey, but everyone is welcome to contribute in the comments to this post.
* There were **25** yes vs **4** no to create post flairs for the sub, and there were **12** yes vs **17** no to make them mandatory for every new post  → Post flairs will be added soon, but they will not be required. We *might* consider making them mandatory only for applications posts in the future.
* Several people expressed they would like to see new mods being added, so we will look into that soon.
* For style, a few people agreed we could use a banner picture. Feel free to make submissions in the comments to this post.
* Some people also suggested we make weekly pinned posts to encourage participation in the sub, so we will look into that too.
* 5 people left responses to the feedback question and I'm glad to see they were all positive (my favorite ""'twas good! ur doing gr8 sweaty""). I think this survey was successful overall, so we may continue to make them  whenever we need community input.

Thank you again to everyone who participated!"

Looking for some input from fellow students here. I’m an MA student in the GSAS and one of my classes for the spring semester was overenrolled due to a mistake on the program’s end. To rectify this situation, they decided to pull names out of a hat to determine who would need to drop the class.

This really does not sit well with me, and I feel as though a school with the supposed meritocracy of NYU should be able to find a more suitable solution. (Abiding by a traditional “first-come, first-served” system, allowing for extra students for the semester, etc.) We aren’t going into debt for our names to be pulled out of a sorting hat like this is fucking Hogwarts, ya know?

I’m just wondering if anyone has had similar experiences with their programs making mistakes like this in the past. I’ve already reached out to the program to express these concerns (no reply), but am wondering if I should report it higher up? Or am I just being a dramatic bitch?

Meanwhile, I was just talking to my buddy at U Chicago who got a few of his buddies + found some people on here and they rented out a whole ass penthouse, and each only paid about 850$/mo. (This seems great at first but thirty people to a penthouse is actually quite overwhelming.) I still think his idea sounds pretty great... with about 10 people. The rent would come out to 950-1300$/mo, depending on how many people we decide on!

Thats the ""apartment"" we are looking at right now. It stretches our price range a bit, but the total price looks like 12000/mo. The house also comes with a backyard, a Terrance and 3 separate floors of housing for some more privacy. As you can see this is a super worthy score! However, we are not sure this is THE one we are choosing. We are open to suggestions! 

SO who is this random girl you may hypothetically be moving in with? I should probably introduce myself! 

Hey! Im Gray... I know it's a strange name. If you need to know I grew up in a super religious family, my dad is actually a priest, and my parents named me Grace. Ew. So if you can't tell by that I'm Agnostic, but am open to all people from all religious standpoints. I'm going to be. freshman in Bio this year as I am starting my long journey to be a doctor. (Pre-med crew HMU) However, again open to all people of all majors. The housing is going to be co-ed as my two friends will be coming to live here. (one is a male, his name is Nathon and he is very gay, and one is Liza) So we are open to literally anyone. We have one dog. Her name is Maggie. She is a shelter dog so we are not sure about the breed, she is medium sized about 30 pounds. We enjoy occasional parties but not anything HUGE. No one in our house smokes, and we plan to keep it that way, at least inside the house, smoking outside is fine. One of my friends drinks socially so we are okay with that. Please contact us with any questions. Thank you!!! Hope to hear from you"

I just received the offer letter in my email couple minutes ago. I will receive hourly pay &amp; health, dental, vision benefits and 401k. 

However, I feel like I must tell the recruiter that I'm a F-1 student, but I was scared to mention it during the offer call since they might rescind my offer. I know I can do paid internships with CPT. However, I feel like I'm still being deceitful to the company by kinda ""don't ask don't tell""-ing this process. I'm very afraid that they might rescind the offer down the line for this exact reason. This offer is very valuable to me, and a rescind will destroy me.

All my friends are telling me to NOT mention it to the recruiter, and start the CPT process with OGS immediately. But I'm not sure if this is the smart way to go about this process.

For F-1 students who had internships in the past, what should I do?

Thank you."

I know there are a lot of posts about the Health insurance, but I think my case is a bit different. I am a PhD student who will be at NYU as Visiting Student (J-1 Visa) in the spring semester ( Janaury 27, 2020  - May 19, 2020) and I am struggling on the topic. I am reading that NYU's insurance is really good and it is the best option for most of the students, but for me it seems a bit oversized: I will be at NYU only four months and I don't even attend classes but just do research. I will pay about 2000$ for plan that covers from January 9, 2020 through August 20, 2020, but I will be back to my country the 20th of May. 

So, I was wondering if there is any other Visiting Student that opted for another solution and can suggest another insurance plan.

Thank you!"

I’m a freshman living in Lipton right now and looking for someone (male) in Founders to do a bed to bed with at the beginning of Spring Semester. If you are interested pls dm me so we can discuss more details.

Reasons I want to do this bed to bed:
1. 90% of my friends live in Founders, and its easier for me to hang out &amp; maintain friendship with them.
2. My job’s location is also close to founders so it’s a much more easy commute.

What you can get if you are willing to do this bed to bed:
1. Nice location. Lipton is super close to Bobst &amp; most of the classrooms near WSP. Also i currently live in a lower floor which makes it unnecessary to wait 5 mins for the elevator when u are heading to class. Just a short walk down the stairs.
2. Roommates are super nice. Great to hang out with and usually pretty quiet &amp; respect your personal space.
3. Dining hall inside the hall. No need to go out to get food on a snowy day."

I live near Manhattan in a nice neighborhood and because I am instate, I would be getting some possible aid from NYU and Fordham. I would most likely get my own place like apartment near the schools and would want to major in computer science or information science. The reason I also applied to Maryland was only because of the ranking of its computer science program. I didn't like the campus, I am not the typical college student and don't really care about the traditional experience all I want to do is make friends and go to a good school to earn some money. I actually feel very uncomfortable going to Maryland and am attending it and it just seems weird for me. I didn't make any friends, most kids here are from maryland so its hard to actually find something common with them. Its like a culture shock like im in a different country. I am currently a sophomore and will be attending UMD for this spring to but as a junior I feel like I should go somewhere else. Since I transferred to UMD from a CC. I would be graduating about a year and a semester late so I feel like id rather go somewhere I feel comfortable and just keep working hard. I have heard the tandon at NYU for CS is not good and the main campus CS is part of the arts college at NYU. I was also thinking about information systems and dont know how that is ranked at NYU. Fordham I would go to the lincoln center campus not the bronx and I have heard its really bad for computer science so I would have to go into information science business. Now, I feel comfortable at NYU or Fordham due to it being close to home and I can connect better with the people. At maryland, I just don't like it at all and if it wasn't for the computer science program, I would have never applied. Now the cost is also changing my mind. I did not get aid at all and am paying 37k a year for tuition without room and board. I think I can lower my Fordham tuition or NYU. Is NYU as bad as they say for comp sci? Is Fordham as bad as they say? Should I suck it up and suffer and just graduate from Maryland? Being isolated here I barely talk to anyone and can't even get connections with people due to it being hard just to live here. I just don't know what to do? Any suggestions?"

I’m a graduating high school senior who applied Early Decision II this last fall and should know whether or not I’m going in a few weeks (Feb 15). I applied to NYU EDII because when I visited the campus, it seemed really nice and also like it had a lot of what I was looking for. Their study abroad programs were really cool, New York is an awesome place, I like being independent and learning to manage my own life, and I feel pretty interested in the majors, or at the very least like I’ll have the freedom to explore a bunch of different things and hone in on what I want to commit to. 

That said, I’m a bit concerned about feeling isolated while I’m there, if I end up getting in. While I’m not terribly interested in the “typical college experience”, as I don’t think going to huge house parties frequently or big football games is really my thing, I do get the impression that there are quite a few students here that feel lonely and have difficulty making friends. 

The common thread I see is that the students who are more proactive and explore their hobbies and really make the effort to make friends will end up making friends. This sort of makes me feel better, since I do have a lot of hobbies and I do like being around people and I try to be as friendly as possible. It is hard though since I have a fair bit of social anxiety and I went to a small high school where I felt disconnected from people I knew who went to larger high schools. 

At any rate, if I’m accepted, I’m compelled to go. I am ultimately hopeful about the school and it seems really awesome all in all, but I’m concerned about some stuff because people do really like shitting on NYU online. 

Is there anything else I should be cognizant of, especially when it comes to settling in my freshman year, doing well in classes, and making friends? 

I know this question has been asked a lot, but I think it would be insightful to include some details about my life in this iteration of it.

Thanks in advance :)"

I do not know why this mouse decided to come in here as I do eat in here but throw all food related garbage directly in the trash chute and check for crumbs. The first night I stayed here I swore I heard strange noises coming from the heater which I never turn on but thought I was just wylin tbh. Now I am thinking that my heater is where they are coming from possibly.I emailed housing and put in another request but I know they do not care at all and at this point I I have been up all night as the mouse has come back and dissapeared behind my dresser which Im not understanding as there is truly no food there or by my shoes when it first came in.

I did ED 2 to NYU and they require you to send the midyear report. However, my grades dropped significantly from my last 3 years of highschool. I had a cumulative avg of 97.77 from freshmen to junior year but recently I got my midyear report back and got a 92.29 avg for senior year. The reason my grades dropped so much was because I wasn't able to come to school for two weeks due to an emergency medical procedure. As a result, I got left back in all my classes, and had a difficult time catching up. I'm currently taking three AP Courses: Comp sci, Chemistry, and Calc AB, so all the workload I had to catch up on was difficult to manage. Mainly AP COMP sci - I took that class, not knowing a single thing about coding, and it's not my intended major at all.

My current Midyear report:

The study of drama(elective) - 80

AP Computer Science - 75

AP Chemistry - 97

English - 100

AP Calc AB - 80

American Government - 96

I applied for pre-med, and I'm hoping my high grades in science classes like AP Chem will back that up, but I'm worried about them seeing my low grades on Comp sci, Calc, and drama. I am getting back on track though, and improving a lot in Comp sci, got a 92 on the midterm, but since I failed the last two tests before that, my avg came out pretty low.

Should I contact the admissions office and explain to them why my grades dropped dramatically? Please give me some advice on what I should do. Thank you"

That said, the more research I do on SPS as a whole, the less convinced I am — I'm seeing a lot of mixed reviews online about how SPS has a lower reputation than the rest of NYU's schools. One post I saw on here even said that it was like the ""Devry arm of NYU"" (lol). For what it's worth, most of this info is 5+ years old and it seems like most of the negative attention was geared more toward the school's bachelor's degrees. I also haven't really found much negative about the actual program I was accepted into — that said, I haven't found a lot about the publishing degree other than what's posted on the school's site.

While SPS's reputation obviously shouldn't be a deciding factor in whether I choose to attend, seeing posts like this do make me a little bit hesitant, so I'm wondering if anybody enrolled in the program (or any students/ alumni of SPS!) might be able to share their thoughts on the pros and cons of SPS/ the Center for Publishing?

So, I am thinking of applying to NYU's Game Center, but I'd like to hear an opinion from actual students there. Do you like it? If no, why not? How are the professors? 

Is there actually any cons to mot apply for it? I myself am studying in BMCC for graphic design, but I always was interested in games (mostly videogames) consider myself a gamer. And the opportunity of studying by playing the games, or/and creating them seems to be very intriguing. 

On another hand, I've read that it is not so easy, one has to take a lot of motes, remembers a lot of things (names, dates, mechanics, etc) to pass. Is that true?

&amp;#x200B;

Now, if not Tisch, but games, how about Tandon? Is it the same teaching they have, or more of a technical approach - programming, PC architectures, etc? 

Thank you."

It costs $1K and you can do it over 30 hours online at your own pace. While the actual info of these videos probably isn't worth the money, I'm wondering if having this certificate would be a smart move towards gaining creditability and/or connections in the NYC music industry or would it just be looked at as meaningless? Although this is an online course, would there be any way to leverage this into something that builds relationships at NYU or with other companies? 

&amp;#x200B;

Background (Sorry it's long):  


I'm in my late 20s and, although  I've always wanted to work in the music industry but I currently work in tech sales which I hate. A few years back I was living in Denver and I did a couple of unpaid internships with very small, somewhat random places (A super tiny, upstart record label that failed, a small music PR firm in a genre I was unfamiliar with). None fo this panned out to anything meaningful. I should've clearly known more about the difference between a good and bad internship and done my research and I  should've also understood that Denver isn't a place to be if you're truly looking for opportunities in the music world. But instead I wasted a lot  year and money. Off the tail end of those let downs, I randomly met someone who was working at a  tech start up who offered me an entry level sales job on the spot and I took it because I needed an option at that point or I would have to move home. I worked that job for about a year and then ended up very unexpectedly moving to the NYC for family reasons (long story). So now I'm finally here but I've been working in Tech because it's the only thing on my resume that has any substance. Tt's frustrating because I know I'm finally in a place with opportunities in the music industry but I don't really have the connections or resume or even the awareness of how to move in that direction. Also I'm older. 

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone who's familiar with Tisch or Clive Davis has opinions lmk please!"

NYU SH was my second choice, but I do see all the benefits and cool resources/opportunities students get while studying in Shanghai. I want to go into Business and Finance, and I know that NYU SH could potentially help guide me along the right path for careers in that field. But for anyone that goes to NYU SH now.. it it worth all the money? I got a bit of aid, but it'll still be $40k/year, and I'd basically have to pay all of it with loans. I am very willing to invest in my education at NYU SH if I'll get opportunities there that I won't get anywhere else, but I'm just wondering if I'm better off saving my money and going to CC or a state uni instead.

Honestly, I'm pretty convinced of going already (even though I'll be hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt), but I'm curious to hear other peoples' viewpoints of the school!"

So I applied ED2 into CAS (Comparative Literature) for Fall ‘20 and was accepted into LS with the requirement of studying in Paris first year. I’m super, super lost and in need of a lot of guidance to know if I should enroll (the enroll deadline is super soon, March 1) and if anyone with experience with CLS could help me out it’d be greatly appreciated!!

To be honest I’d been caught between applying into CAS for Lit or Tandon for Mech-E, as I have a passion for both. Somewhere along the way I told myself I’d just try and double major, as hard as that is (at least it’s Comp Lit and not English - so it should be lighter). I know that’s not possible if I were to be at CAS (I think?) since CAS generally doesn’t allow double majoring in something outside the school, but it would be possible if I were at Tandon and decided to get a double major in Comp Lit from CAS. 

My only question then is - is internally transferring from CLS to Tandon common? Could I do it prior to the 2 year completion of CLS? And supposing I did successfully transfer, would I still be able to declare and complete a double major within four years, let alone complete the Mech E major within four years since CLS tends not to have too many STEM classes (in Paris at least)?

Another question - is studying away from NYC freshman year that bad of an idea? Is it possible to ask to switch campuses?

I’m a transfer student from a small college town, grew up in the suburbs. I also have anxiety &amp; ADHD so you could imagine how much those two things heightened upon moving to NYC.

I’ve been crying in my room after classes every day, dropping by the wellness center every 2-3 days. They’ve referred me to outside psychiatrists recently, haven’t met any of them yet though. Being in class makes me feel so on-edge. I don’t like two of my classes here in CAS. One of them has a subject I can’t stand (need it for Core requirements though) with an incredibly dull teacher, and the other one has a TA who refuses to help me understand material.

 It’s not even the difficulty of the classes, rather it’s my lack of friends in said classes and lack of interest in the subjects. I tried to join clubs to make friends. The only club I found engaging and fun meets 9:30-11:30pm so going there is difficult for me after crying all afternoon. My lack of friends to eat with is making my past eating disorder slowly return.

It’s also the environment here. During a Welcome Week tour, a student worker literally grabbed me by my clothes when we were crossing the street because she thought I was walking too slow. All the friends I tried to make, I don’t see them again on campus. It’s so cold here, I don’t feel motivated to go anywhere (I’m from California). 

Lastly, if I stayed in my public school, my parents would’ve been able to save the equivalent of an extra car in terms of cost each semester. Is it really worth the money when I’m so miserable and anxious every day?

I dropped by the academic advising office a few days ago in tears and the counselor pulled out a withdrawal form from the top drawer of her desk AS IF THAT WERE A NORMAL THING to have in the top drawer of a desk here. She said I’d get 50% of my money back for tuition and all the money back for housing (minus the month I stayed). It was a really tempting offer, but the image of my parents’ disappointment entered my head and I told her I’ll think about it.

Have you felt this way your first semester? Is this normal?"

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Could you help us understand how emotions buffer people against stress experienced by immigrants?  


To participate in this study, you need to be 

1.       International students or second-generation immigrant and

2.       In college or graduate school

You will only take some short online surveys (25 minutes long). We don't collect any information on immigration status or physical address. 1 in 5 participants will win a $25 Amazon gift card. We also got IRB approval. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**This research can help identify more protective factors for immigrants with fewer resources.**  **Further , this study hopes to contribute to reducing health disparities in immigrant families.**  If you are willing to help, please reach me by direct message.

Thank you!"

I was to get in touch with students about actions which may have been taken by the university to protect students from the coronavirus, as well as measures that may have been taken anticipating future study by students.

If you were in China through a study program when the virus broke out- what were your experiences like? Did the school or program help you get home? If you're planning on leaving for China soon, what now?  thought I'd post here to get an idea of whether NYU students have had an issue with this.

        A couple of days ago NYU released their EDII decisions and I was accepted to NYU Shanghai.  I was very shocked because at this point I had kind of forgotten that I even clicked that box.  I was also under the impression that NYU Shanghai was more prestigious than the NYC NYU so I didn’t understand how I could be rejected from from and accepted to NYU Shanghai.  The more I think about the prospect of going to NYU Shanghai the more I open up to the idea.  So I have some questions and am seeking some guidance from people with more knowledge than me.

I was offered 30k in financial aid per year bringing my cost to 41k.  My portal says the 30k comes from the NYU Shanghai Scholarship UG.  So my first question is what is this scholarship that they’ve given me?  Is it need bass or merit based?  Is 30k a competitive offer for NYU Shanghai, I it possible to get more and if so do you think I could get more?

My second question is how selective is NYU Shanghai compared to the other campuses, specifically the College of Arts and Sciences in NYC?  Are the acceptance rate and the average act/sat scores available online for NYU Shanghai misleading?  Is NYU Shanghai as prestigious as NYC NYU?

From the research that I’ve done it seems like I have to spend 2 semesters abroad. I would like to know if you can spend more than 2 semesters abroad and if so can it be at the same campus?  For instance would I be able to spend more than 2 semesters at NYC NYU.  

I am definitely not a STEM oriented person and from what I’ve read it seems like a STEM oriented program.  How is the academic life for student not looking to pursue something in the STEM?

I currently speak zero Mandarin.  How big of an disadvantage does this put me at in terms of learning it from complete scratch and life in Shanghai?  How much does the school encourage and help with exploring the city?

Do I have to live in University housing for my first two years or can I live off-campus?

My last question is how difficult is it to transfer to the College of Arts and Sciences from NYU Shanghai either freshmen or sophomore year?

If you’ve made it this far thank you reading and I appreciate any comments."

Soooo the EDII decisions are out, and I was... accepted to NYU in Shanghai!!!!!!!

I applied for NYU in Abu Dhabi for the full grant opportunity and did not make it unfortunately, but still I got accepted at NYUSH since I set it as a second choice, and now honestly I have no idea what to do. NYU was my dream college,especially Abu Dhabi with its financial aid opportunities, and I really could not believe that I can get in with my stats and everything, but now when Im accepted to Shanghai there are more complications regarding the coronavirus situation ( which my parents are really afraid of) , and of course, the financing. I got about 35K in aid, but its still not enough because our family will be able to contribute 25K at maximum, so here is the thing:

1. Is there any opportunity to get more financial aid now after the decisions are out??
2. Am I able to request for the transfer to another Campus?
3. Since this is not my prior choice of campus, do I really have [to](https://to.do) make my final decision until march 1st? ( Cuz many other colleges have deadlines much later, and I might get better offers\_
4. Will the NYUSH experience be worth the money that I am expected to pay in terms of further opportunities with career/networking? 
5. What would the coronavirus situation be in Fall 2020??? This is a main concern for my parents ( other than money lol) 

I am really clueless about what to do now, since this is obviously going to be a financial burden and the Shanghai campus was not really what I was aiming for, but still I feel that I could miss such a wonderful opportunity.... So any advice/tip on what I could do in situation might help :)

Anyways, another important thing to consider is that I am an international applicant from a ""third world country"" so I really did not think that I could get SUCH an opportunity in my life with US colleges..."

I was hoping someone might have some experience with it or heard anything about it. The two main things that dissuade me from the program are Studying Away for two semesters and the curriculum. 


I would be perfectly fine with Studying Abroad for a semester, and I'm sure that there are great experiences to be had, but by leaving for an entire year my sophomore year, I feel like I would be missing out a lot on different connections/opportunities/experiences/friends back in NYC. As someone who has traveled almost their entire life, I honestly am not a huge fan of it anymore, and would rather spend my time on 'campus.'



Also, I'm genuinely *not sure* if the curriculum is something I would enjoy. Its very broad, with cores into things like Social Impact and Politics, and I don't know if a typical Stern business major is something I would enjoy more.

Today I got my acceptance letter for the Wagner MPA program and I'm so so so happy!NYU was my #1 school and I'm just elated to have been admitted. I will be visiting for the admitted students' reception in a few weeks, but before then I wanted to see if anybody on here is/was a Wagner MPA student, and if so, you'd be willing to answer a couple questions I have.

Long story short, I'm basically deciding between NYU and Syracuse. Both are really great programs with Int'l Development concentrations that are structured, yet flexible enough to be tailored exactly to my interests. My long-term goal is to work in the Int'l Development/Governance realm (i.e. UN, USAID, etc) and obviously because it's in NYC, NYU is the perfect place to do that. I see that Wagner offers several ""study abroad"" courses over summer and winter breaks, which intrigues me a lot. In fact, I haven't seen a single MPA program other than Wagner that offers as many abroad opportunities that don't needlessly extend the time taken to get the degree. Has anyone done any of those and if so, did you find that studying abroad helped you career-wise? Additionally, I'm wondering if anyone could shed a little light on whether most students attend full time or part time; i.e. is Wagner flexible enough that if I wanted to work while going to school I'd be able to?

....which leads me main concern...money. Specifically the cost of living; how did you manage paying for rent on top of school (i.e. is it even doable to work at least part time while attending Wagner)? If I didn't have a job and attended as a full time student, I'd probably be looking at six figures in loans. Ouch.

I should hear about potential merit aid in the next couple days, but money aside, I am so thrilled at the prospect of going to NYU and can't wait to learn more in a few weeks while I visit. Cheers and thanks for taking the time to read/respond to this!"

Just wanted to get some feedback regarding my profile. I actually didn't know about NYU Courant until I tracked down a professor that I wanted to do research with, and I'll admit that seeing the faculty (machine learning) scares me a bit. There's quite a few well-known names and it seems that I'm nowhere near the caliber of the students that may get admitted.

Anyway, I'll just post the stats right away and add any background info at the bottom for anyone's who's interested.

- GPA: 3.84/4.0 (master's - 1/4 semesters so far), 3.2ish/4.0 (undergrad)
- GRE: 163V/169Q/5.5AW
- Research: one publication in a domestic conference (Korea), submitted one paper to an int'l conference in January (second author - awaiting results), involved in three research projects right now but not sure if those will actually culminate into publications.

Any feedback is appreciated!

For some background info, I'm currently a master's student pursuing a CS degree at a school in Korea (Korea University in case anyone's curious) and just finished my first semester. I'm looking to apply this year so that if all goes as planned then I'll be starting my program right after graduation.

I've been trying to take as many math courses as I can (despite my peer's ridicule) because I felt that my mathematical background is way too weak to conduct meaningful research in my field of interest (geometric deep learning) and I know that Courant is a mathematics or theory-focused school."
