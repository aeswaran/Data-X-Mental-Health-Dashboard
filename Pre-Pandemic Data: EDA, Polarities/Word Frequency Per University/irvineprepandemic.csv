Looking for advice for my classes and how to get that thicc 4.0. Any tips would be very much appreciated. 

&amp;#x200B;

[CLASSES](https://imgur.com/a/vaKux5W)

BIOSCI 2A, 2 units P/NP, Fung/Metherate

BIOSCI 93, 4 units, Metherate/Stephens

CHEM 1A, 4 units, Charette

SOCIOL 1, 4 units, Avery

ANTHRO 2A, 4 units, Douglas, 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*MY REASONING\*\*

For context, I went to a super, super competitive, rigorous, and high ranking high school. Passed 18 AP courses with 4s and 5s, including multiple self-studied tests, and like to believe I have pretty good study skills, time management, etc. Academically I also like to believe I'm very prepared for college, but I just want to be ready for the worst case scenario. I know it's entirely diff at UCI, but most of the high achievers from my high school say college is way easier than our high school academics. 

 

Basically I'm taking 16 units, since Bio2a and Bio194s are P/PN. I've been told those two classes don't even really qualify as classes because apparently they're that easy? Thoughts? 

&amp;#x200B;

For Bio93, I've taken AP Bio, regular bio, and also did Biology Olympiad, which is the entirety of the Campbell book. I'm fairly confident for this one, as bio has never been hard for me. I'm currently watching the lectures online, and the material seems pretty straightforward. Basically...memorization? I plan to use Anki, Quizlet, basically all resources I can find. 

&amp;#x200B;

For Chem 1a, I've taken AP Chemistry and honors chem. Also watching the lectures currently. Is the entire chem series just review of AP chem? I would love to get ahead for this class, cause I rely on doing problems to get a solid grasp of materials.  This is the class I am least confident in, but I still feel pretty confident in my ability to pull an A. Any tips for chem 1a, or chem in general?

&amp;#x200B;

For Sociol 1 and Anthro 2a, I've heard these are basically the easiest classes at UCI. If they're just memorization/note taking, then I think I'd be set for this class.

&amp;#x200B;

This turned out a lot longer than I thought it'd be. Anyways, I really appreciate any words of advice, even if they're brutally honest. I'm willing to work my ass off, so please help if you have any insightful guidance! ty!"

For those who don’t know, Teresa neighbors is currently the co-director of the Summer Academic Enrichment Program. I was a part of one of the cohorts over the summer, when she confessed to ALL OF US that she was arrested for being part of a prostitution/drug ring while living in Minnesota. She swore us all to secrecy, which I already thought was suspicious that a grown ass woman would tell a group of - essentially - children to trust with her fire secret. She confessed that she had not disclosed this fact with UCI, and made us swear to secrecy.
The reason that I share this is that I’m tired of being part of this fucked up secret. She should not be working there, and even made it clear that other faculty wanted her out (for obvious reasons). She is a dangerous and manipulative woman who should not have any authority, especially over young students who are fighting for social justice. She is a toxic individual who is only looking out for herself.  If there is anyone else who is part of the cohort in question- you know who you are - I open the door for you to share your experiences. I’m done staying silent.

Just based on Handshake I can't answer about half the questions.

Getting extracurriculars is going to be tough for me to do because of my mom's paranoia. I couldn't do any during high school ECs (couldn't stay after school) and currently she'd rather I take the bus home than stay in school 1-2 hours for her to pick me up after work. Personally I'd skip fall ECs anyway so that I can adjust, but, at least for this year, I know there's slim to none I'll be able to do any.

Was hoping to get an summer internship, but seems far fetched atm. For future internships/research/whatever though, what can I do to try to build some experience/skills to put forth? Any advice would be great.

I'm sorry if this isn't the best place to ask/has been asked before (admittedly didn't search too hard here but didn't find much). If so, I'd appreciate it if y'all could direct me to where I can find this info."

I am currently enrolled at a CCC and am planning on transferring into a UC with Comp Sci. I am currently taking Calc 3, Phys M20B and Linear Algebra. At the start of this semester I have a 3.74 GPA and if I (hopefully) get all A's I will have around a 3.81 GPA. I can see the transfers for UCLA are from (3.8 - 3.9) GPA range, and for Irvine somehow its lower to (3.6-3.79). Does this mean most likely am guaranteed to transfer into UCI if I get my GPA above last transfers average?

Also I am planning on filling out my TAG, and see that you can't TAG UCI for Comp Sci, do you guys have any recommendations on other majors that are related that I should tag or preferably another UC that is good to tag Comp Sci too?

I'm currently Unaffiliated and have looked into many majors that are offered, and PoliSci is one of the only majors I can see myself studying for and doing something with in the future. The wave of STEM majors and their respective job prospects have definitely made me doubt myself and have lowered my confidence in the field, but I truly want to pursue political science. The possibilities for a career in political science seem limited, however, and I was wondering if anyone else is pursuing PoliSci as a major and if they could provide much needed insight for me. I can see myself double majoring or even minoring if it'll make my job prospects more favorable. Sorry for the long post but I guess I need a little guidance. Cheers!"

Context
I live around 30-45 minutes from UCI (depending on traffic times), but since it’s my first year here I had my heart set on dorming. 

Since then, I found out one of my roommates is getting up at 6Am daily because of sports; and the other roommates seem to be okay with that, being all 3 of them will wake up at the same time.

To be clear I am definitely NOT a morning person, especially one that will wake up at 6 when I have 11AM classes.
I’m reluctant of putting down $15k, and waking up that early and sleeping (at who knows what time, and I think the other 3 are just like “whatever” we can each sleep whenever we want) - thinking that itll negatively affect my studying and health

What should I do??? I’m considering just commuting because dorming is around $15k, and I think I could get more sleep and just the same amount of studying done. Would my social life be that heavily diminished if I choose to stay home???"

Currently incoming third year MAE major and hopeful Informatics minor. 

I've been waiting on my minor class (In4Matx161) as i'll be able to enroll once the fees get processed, but upon looking at my schedule I see that I can easily fit in the GE (AsianAM 50)  I have as a placeholder alongside my minor. While I know having something fit doesn't mean it's optimal, I've dealt with an 18 Unit workload twice before and have been able to endure it.

The main classes I'm concerned about are AsianAm50 and EngrMAE130A. I've not really found much information on either, but if the workloads on those are tolerable then this might save me from taking Summer School.

Attached below is a photo link to my schedule including my extra curriculars. I honestly might be over my head on this, but the reward of helping myself in the long run makes it so enticing. Let me know and every opinion I can get is welcomed.

I’m back for a graduate program as well. However, I can’t help but feel a little jealous of the newer students and how much better UCI seems than back when I started. Like the housing seems better with the Mesa Towers, the new Middle Earth Towers, and the new Plaza Verde. The dining halls also seem newer and better than when I was a freshmen. Even the new classroom buildings seem kind of lit. UTC also has developed a lot now that there’s target, some clothing stores, and dunkin donuts. Back as a freshmen, it was just a bunch of dance and yoga studios. Hell, I’m also jealous that the new incoming freshmen get to come in knowing that they had a low acceptance rate and that UCI is a “top college” -the acceptance rate back when I was a freshman was nearly 50% and UCI wasn’t even in the top 5 UCs. I feel like a lot of freshmen had UCI as one of their top choices, rather than the “I only came here because I was rejected by UCLA and UC Berekely” conversations I’d always hear. 

I love that I got to see UCI progress to what it is now, and will continue to see it progress as a grad student. However, I can’t help but feel a little jealous of incoming freshmen knowing they’ll probably have a better experience than I had as a freshmen. Does anybody else feel the same way?"

Is it possible to get more than a third of your subsidized loan at a time? I'm realizing the next financial aid disbursement will happen January 2nd, but I will have to pay for the rent for January with the disbursement that I receive on the 23rd of this month. That's 5 months of rent because I differed September since I CANNOT AFFORD IT UNTIL THEY DISBURSE THE MONEY TO US. :'( I could technically pay for that month if I didn't buy groceries or textbooks, or literally anything other than my rent from october till that date.

For those of you who don't know, 143B is the Project in Operating Systems course. There's 2 projects during the quarter. We finally got access to the course materials on canvas last week. It's here that the professor announces that he will be teaching this class as an ""online-hybrid"" course. 


So since he stuck this label on it, it pretty much means that he's allowed to not lecture and post all of his slides and lectures online as videos. Fine, whatever, let's check out the lectures, I thought. Joke's on me. These aren't lectures. They're 5 minute long videos which provide a BRIEF explanation of each part of the project. There's not even a project assignment sheet. Just these videos to reference for requirements. Somewhere in this godforsaken pit of little to no information, he mentioned that you could also refer to the textbook for some clarification. 


So let's check out the textbook which, by the way, is a required online textbook that Lubomir *wrote himself*. He claims this makes it cheaper for us, but really it means he makes even more pocket money off of all of us student's. Especially since it's an online textbook which means he doesn't even have to pay the printing costs. On top of all of this, he says there are essential quizzes in the book which are required for our grade. So he's forcing us to buy it. Fine, shady tactics, but whatever, let's check out the book. I buy it today and this thing has literally no extra material besides the slides he already posted on canvas. IT'S LITERALLY THE SAME THING. The book has 4 ""pages"". Each page is literally just his slides copy and pasted in. And these quizzes in the book could have totally been posted to canvas instead. 


TL;DR: Lubomir Bic has successfully figured out a way to not only lecture less, teach less, and be less available to his students. He is also swindling extra money from each of his students by forcing them to buy a completely unnecessary online textbook which provides no extra material than what he posts on canvas. All under the guise of teaching a project course."

It isn't like I did nothing wrong and got screwed over anyway (I only finished Writing 39C winter quarter last year), but a lot of bio majors have felt that the difficulty of getting into required classes is unfair for years now.

I am an incoming freshman and I have recently seen that two of courses that I enrolled in during SPOP do not appear and one of them has been replaced with a different class. I enrolled in ICS 31, ICS 90, Math 2B, and Psychology 9A for the Fall Quarter, but in the My Courses section of the ZotPortal (which i recently discovered by myself as no one said where to look to see your schedule) I see that there are only the ICS 31, Math 2B, and ICS 60 which I never signed up for. 

Is there a way to check if WebReg sent me a confirmation when I enrolled during SPOP because I checked multiple times with the counselors there to see if everything was right and they said it was all good. I shouldve taken a picture of the confirmation page because I forgot if it even asked to send a reciept to a preferred email address and I dont see a confirmation receipt in any of my email addresses. I dont want to call the office yet because they will just give me depressing news about all the courses being full etc. 

Someone please help and tell me the best way to proceed."

If I do transfer, how long will it take for my to get my Bachelors? Is being in a dorm required? I live in Corona, and I don't mind waking up at 3am to drive over there

I am pretty poor, I don't have any money, if that has any thing to do with it

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks"

After spending freshman year trying to figure out what I want as a career, I've come to the decision that I want to be a seismologist. This whole summer I've been researching degree requirements (which is mainly geophysics) and I am wondering what to do as a major at UCI, since it doesn't offer geophysics.

Currently I'm in the Psychological Science major. This year I'd be working to switch to my preferred major. I've been studying physics on Khan Academy to refresh my skills, but I'm not sure if it's physics, earth science, or something else at UCI I should do.

Considering the main field of study is geophysics, I wondered about switching to physics. However, earth science is also an option. I may talk to my academic counselor about these thoughts, but I'm wondering if any of you have input? My end goal is to be a seismologist, no matter what I do.

My cumulative weighted GPA is a 4.9945 and unweighted 4.4444 on a 5.0 scale. I got my first 3 C's all in one year, as a sophmore. Turned it all around junior year thankfully and I hope to keep it up. My GPA converted to the UC scale (thanks to rogerhub) is *around* a 3.62 weighted and 3.34 unweighted.

As for AP's, I have taken human geography and government/economics. Scored a 4 on hg, a 2 on government (not reporting that one), and did not take economics for some reason. This year I am taking psychology, environmental science, computer science principles, and 2 dual credit college courses: rhetoric and math for gen ed. I plan on taking 3 AP exams.

DECA is the main club I was really invested in and that was in my junior year. I participated but did not place at state competition. Other smaller school clubs: Cougar club and most recently Gaia (environmental club). I work as a sales associate in American Eagle.

I'm going to graduate by the end of this year, but I remember the feeling of being new and not having any friends for the first couple of months. It sucked, honestly. I tried joining a lot of math clubs, but many were overly formalized and no one could get past the thicc layer of awkwardness. I even tried starting one and it failed because I'm a dumb nut and made it overly formal and ruined everything. If you're a math major, then you like math, but when the day has come to an end, everyone just wants to chill and not use up anymore energy on trying to solve problems. Maybe you just want to chill and play video games, trade math memes, or eat food. We are enthusiastic and talk about math! but just want to emphasize the primary function of our club is socializing and chilling.

As in the title, we aren't officially recognized by the school because you have to pay like $30. Although there are benefits to applying, such as being able to reserve a room for our club usage, we don't really mind. We also have no club leader, president, vice president, secretary, or whatever. The club is alive because of all of the awesome people that joined it, and so, I really mean it when I say that everyone who has joined the club are very important people. They really give the club so much dynamism and character.

There are currently about 5 or 6 of us. We meet every Friday, chill at the school for an hour or two, and dine out together. If you're interested, message me on Reddit and we'll add you to the group chat."

l[Summary of Features](https://i.imgur.com/yRZmB9u.png)

Hope you are all having a great time away the Anteater Involvement Fair. We wanted to announce a new release of ZotTrail iOS.

# Features
**Grade Distributions**

Open some course (*Course Info Page*), and you’ll [find a colored bar chart that shows you the % of people who got A’s, B’s, and so on.](https://imgur.com/a/JVwarJ4) A large green bar means many A’s!

* ***Displaying by Time***: We’re not stopping there though. You can filter by past year, past 2 years, and past 5 years. This allows you to see if the professor has been changing the way they grade.
* ***Compare with Other Professors***: But wait, there’s more: for a given class, [you can also compare the current professor with as many professors as you want, within the same graph! This allows you to compare curves.](https://imgur.com/a/uagyQWq)

**Built-in RateMyProfessor Integration**

You can now view RateMyProfessor scores for a professor directly within the app by holding on a course item (same place where you can subscribe to notifications). We do plan to move this to the *Course Info Page*.

**Course Search Page: Average Grades**

We revamped the search page a little. [On the right side of every course, you will now find the all-time average grade (past 5 years) that the professor has given for that class.](https://imgur.com/a/Pdzuj0Z)

[You’ll also find this in the *Class List* page](https://imgur.com/a/pMLdFUf), if you ever need a quick reminder on the average grades for your schedule.

**Improved Design and Navigation**

Previously, we had a tab and menu hybrid navigation view. We found that this was confusing, and designed to use the good old universal app menu. We hope these changes improve navigation experience.

Furthermore, we also changed the font, colors, etc of the entire app as a whole.

# What Next?
Within the next week and a half, we’ll be releasing a major feature, UCI navigation, which will be highly integrated with all of our other features. Furthermore, we’ll be releasing *Export to Google Calendar*, which you can use to export your current schedule seamlessly (works for the courses as well as your finals) to your UCI email.
And finally, we’ll be setting up some of the core Android components as well, which I’ll be talking about now.

# Android
We know ZotTrail for Android is a meme at this point, but fear not! We’ve already started work on it, and set up quite a few pages (Search, Libraries). We’re just trying our best to find the best architecture for the app right now. Hit up this reddit account if you'd like to join the team!"

I'm taking Anthro 41A with Douglas, and I read through the syllabus which states ""Laptops, net-books and the use of any other wireless devices are NOT permitted in either the lecture or discussion section."" Exceptions are only accommodated if authorized by the student disabilities office.

I do think this is unfair to people like me who are trying to conserve. I don't want to go out and buy paper and other tools to accompany this one class that I really want to keep when I already have these tools on my iPad.

I got an email saying I had to pass the series (including the labs) during both summer sessions or else I had to be forced to switch my major by Sept. 16th or else my Fall 2019 courses will be dropped. Either that or I had to withdraw from UCI, which is fucking stupid. 

Anyway, I worked my ass off during the summer and passed 51B, 51C, and 51LC. (Definitely don't recommend anyone to do it because learning two o.chem courses in five weeks each isn't fun lmao)

My official, passing grades were up on Sept. 19th but by then my classes dropped, including BIO100, a prerequisite to literally all of my upper divs. Basically, I can't finish my degree unless I get the class. The class has no waitlist and it is IMPOSSIBLE to find an open spot. I went to the BioSci counselors yesterday and they were SO HELPFUL when they basically told me to fuck off and keep checking WebReg. 

I get that they can't help every student and that they can't do anything with the WebReg system, but that's literally the last thing I wanted to hear and I'm so fucking tired of dealing with their shit I'm sorry. I made it this far into my upcoming senior year and I've jumped through their hoops with dealing with two back-to-back o.chem courses (and lab) during both summer sessions and I really can't deal with having 0 units right now.   


My plan rn to to see the BIO100 professor on the first day of class to see what they can do, but aside from that I'm really at a loss of what I can do. If anyone has any insight at all I'd really appreciate it :("

Over two and a half years ago we created the Official r/UCI Discord Server. As the years have gone by many active users have come and gone, but we are always accepting new Anteaters. If you are interested in discussing classes, new, games, anime, or anything else, don't hesitate to join the server!

---

We are currently looking to start having activity nights. Whether that be games, group watching shows, and potentially meetups! All these events should generally be planned by our Community Organizers.

&amp;nbsp;

Going into each quarter we will post a survey to gauge interest for class channels. Classes with the most interest will get dedicated channels for people to discuss the class. We currently have a form in our #announcements channel if you would like to request a class.

&amp;nbsp;

We are also looking for people who might be interested in helping to organize potential activity nights and a role for potential new moderators (preferably new freshman or sophomores).

UCI ICS is a Discord community that provides a casual and responsive environment for all ICS students to connect with their fellow classmates in the same courses.

.

Invite Link: [https://discord.gg/JUE28vP](https://discord.gg/JUE28vP)

.

In contrast to other discussion platforms like Piazza, which provide formal, thread-based communication, the UCI ICS Discord fosters instantaneous and casual discourses. Be it 3 AM last-minutes study session, missed lecture notes, real-time lecture clarification from your peers, or collaborative study guides, you'll find them all here. 

The server is also a place for the questions that seem too trivial for a whole piazza post, the off-topic rants, the self-deprecating memes, and post-exam support groups.

We started off as an academic server for ICS 6N, 51, and 53. The resounding success we saw prompted us to expand the potential of the community by including other ICS courses.

We are also on good terms with the developer of [Stensal Cloud IDE](https://stensal.com/), one of the finest tool in active development for students who are learning C/C++, or are simply sick and tired of segfault frustration. The developer are extremely responsive to student feedback and feature requests, and can be reached within the Discord server.

Good lucks with the upcoming quarter, and we hope to see y'all there."

d9nrf5,Everything an average student needs to know about parking at UCI.,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/d9nrf5/everything_an_average_student_needs_to_know_about/,TheTravelingSee,134,2019-09-26 11:33:30,71,/r/UCI/comments/d9nrf5/everything_an_average_student_needs_to_know_about/,NaN,"Hello. I work for UCI Transportation. I've been seeing an influx of questions regarding parking at UCI from incoming freshman and transfers so I thought that I'd just make a post to put some of those questions to rest. 

First and foremost, the student Zone permit system is fairly simple, but also comes with some caveats that you should know to maximize your parking experience. 

Firstly, to pick up your student permit (S or P permit) from a UCI Transportation kiosk YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED YOUR STUDENT ID. We need the magnetic strip from your ID card in order to process the permit. We also need your face to be visible on your student ID so that we can make sure that the correct person is picking up the correct permit. We've had issues with look-a-likes stealing other peoples' permits in the past. So if your ID card does not have a distinguishable image of you on it, please bring some other form of ID so that we may cross reference them.

If you do not have your student ID yet, you can also pick up your permit from the second floor of the police department. That is where the UCI Transportation main office is located. Just provide your proof of purchase.

Secondly, over the weekdays, Zone permit holders can only park in unmarked stalls within their designated Zone from the times of 6:00 AM - 3:00 PM. After 3:00 PM you will be able to park in any unmarked stall in any of the Zones. After 5:00 PM, Zone permit holders will be able to park in any AR non-24 hour enforced (AR Reserved), preferred (P Stalls), or unmarked stall (or Compact Stalls) in any Zone.

These restrictions lift during the weekend. During the weekend you can park in any AR non-24 hour enforced, preferred, or unmarked stall in any Zone all day (6:00 AM - 11:59 PM).

Mind you, the Zone permit is not a 24 hour permit. They are only good for 6:00 AM - 11:59 PM but realistically we don't staff any enforcement attendants after 11:59 PM or before 6:00 AM but be wary, there are always exceptions. 

Preferred Zone permit holders cannot park in AR stalls before 5:00 PM either. Preferred can only park in preferred and unmarked stalls before 5:00 PM. Otherwise, the same rules apply as a regular S permit.

Should you lose or forget your Zone permit somewhere, you can pick up a ""Lost/Forgotten Permit"" as a replacement at any UCI Transportation kiosk. You can do this up to 4 times PER YEAR. Not per permit or quarter, but per year. The year resets June 30th. 

Otherwise, if you do not have a Zone permit, we offer a $13 daily general rate (yes the rates went up) for parking that's good from 6:00 AM - 11:59 PM. Hourly parking is $2/hr. If you're in a rush and want to find a parking stall quickly, you can buy an $18 VIP/AR pass that will allow you to park in AR Reserved stalls. If you don't want to pay the full rate, we have Pay-By-Space dispensers in most of the structures that offer $4/hr parking for those who want to park in any numbered stall.

If you don't want to pay $4/hr for parking, DO NOT PARK IN A NUMBERED STALL. Try to find another dispenser that offers $2/hr or one of our kiosks. They'll be able to help you. 

Dispensers take EXACT CHANGE and DO NOT give refunds (the kiosks do not require exact change but also do not give refunds). If you plan on paying with cash, make sure you have the correct amount. It is UCI Transportation policy in general that we do not provide any sort of refund. So if you try asking, we will more than likely deny you one.

General and hourly permits bought from dispensers and kiosks are good for any unmarked stalls across campus. They are not limited to a zone system. After 5:00 PM, they can also park in any AR non-24 hour enforced, preferred or unmarked stall.

Parking in EV stalls at UCI also requires a valid permit. Your car must be charging in those stalls in order to be able to park there and you have a 3 hour limit. After three hours, you must move your vehicle.

ALL PARKING ON THE UCI CAMPUS MUST BE PAID FOR. There are very few days in which there will be complementary parking. If you aren't sure, ask or buy a permit. If you really want to risk your vehicle getting towed, you can park at UTC (University Town Center). They're pretty good with towing though so I don't recomment that.

If you do decide to park overnight, you can buy an $18 overnight pass from a dispenser which will be good for 24 hours from the time of purchase.

Enforcement patrols are constant and random. Do not try to test the system and get away with it. They actually check permits and permit numbers so forging a permit is pretty bad idea (your car WILL get booted if a forged or stolen permit is found). 

Lastly, no, we DO NOT DRIVE THE BUSES. The Anteater Express is a program run by ASUCI, NOT UCI Transportation. If you'd like more information on that, contact the ASUCI help center or visit them at their main office by the Hill. 

I feel like that's most of it. If I left anything out, then please let me know. If you have any questions, please leave them down below. We're also hiring at UCI Transportation as well, so for anyone who wishes to work for a chill job on campus, go ahead and PM me for the details."

He told me that I could only get lucky in getting this class in the fall and that it was very very unlikely that people would drop it and that I shouldn’t be optimistic. He said I would be fine to get it spring quarter. 
However, 10 minutes ago, a spot randomly appeared. I immediately snatched up the discussion, but I had to drop writing 39b to do it. Webreg rejected me, saying I needed an authorization code from the 39 b instructor. At that point, someone had already taken the lecture. All that had to happen is to get timed out of web reg and that discussion spot would be taken. So I gave up and dropped the discussion. I was so happy when I saw that green open, I could have had a chance. But I’m so dumb to have added writing 39b as a placeholder back in the summer, not knowing I needed a code to drop it. If I didn’t add it, all I had to have done was add mae 10 right now and I could have been on my way to declaring my major by the end of winter. I’m legit crying so hard in my room right now. Now all these thoughts are running through my head that I’ll never be able to enroll in mae 10.

Basically it was closed and they have signs up for the business and clubhouse hours which aren’t open until 8am. And because they were on the door of the fitness center, I guess those are now the operating hours of the gym. So long story short, why isn’t the fitness center 24-hours like said online? No one needs to check ID’s or anything because you have to use the key fob to get access. I guess I just wanted to rant about this because there’s no reason, in my eyes at least, that it’s should be locked from 8am-10pm when no staff operates anything in it.

TL;DR: VDCN fitness center is NOT open 24hrs like advertised on the website."

Ride in the road, not on the sidewalk.

[Biking on the sidewalks is more dangerous than biking on roads.](https://mobikefed.org/2016/08/bicycling-sidewalks-not-safe-not-recommended) UCI is fairly well set up with bike lanes and similar options so you do not need to and should not be biking on the sidewalk. [So please bike in the road.](http://www.bike.cornell.edu/pdfs/Sidewalk_biking_FAQ.pdf)

I know Irvine drivers are not great, [especially on Campus](https://www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/news/tn-dpt-me-uci-bicyclist-20190116-story.html), but if you are smart about when to use crosswalks from the bike lane and you keep an eye on cars, especially ones turning right out of streets, you are safer there than on a sidewalk.

I love biking around UCI and once you bike in the road you will start feeling more comfortable with it. But when I'm driving around and I see a biker in the bike lane cross traffic at a stop sign like a pedestrian, it peeves me. This is how you get hit. Be predictable, act like a vehicle, which you are.

Also quick shout out to everyone: bikers, skateboarders, walkers. Just keep an eye out for each other and you'll avoid accidents. If you're walking with your headphones on and your head down looking at your phone, you're not aware of your surroundings. 

Everyone stay alert, be in the place you belong, and we can keep UCI safe and fun to get around. Have a good year!"

However, if I transfer to UC schools, I think I can pay reasonable cost while I'm studying what I want it. However, I heard CS is generally tough in any college, for instance if UW CS department make student weed out early, other colleges give admission relatively easily(just by fulfilling minimum requirement) but hard to graduate with the CS major.

My friend applied and got the position. It has only been his first week, but all he has been doing is shredding paper, driving the company car to deliver medicine, storing medicine in inventory, and making tea for customers.

I know unpaid internships are generally a bad idea. They’re usually illegal and just a way for the company to get free labor. They also cheapen the market for that field. Why pay to hire a real worker when you can just get unpaid interns? Unpaid internships are only beneficial if you are really learning something. You should have a mentor that is teaching you relevant information that will be useful in your career.

With that being said, my friend says he isn’t learning anything, but he is hoping that if he stays there long enough, they will eventually teach him stuff. He spoke to another ex-intern who worked for a month, and quit because they weren’t learning anything.

My friend has been working 2-4 times a week, 5hr each shift. Not only is he not learning stuff (maybe yet) and not being paid, his grades might suffer at UCI as well.

Has anyone here interned at Newport Coast Pharmacy? I would like to hear your experiences and thoughts.

Prior to one of my lectures I noticed that there is a massive agglomeration of student bum rushing like its black Friday into the lecture halls all whilst the prior class is leaving. This creates a huge mess of pushing and shoving that I'm sure no one wants to be a part of. Let's be courteous to one another and establish some common mannerisms.  

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Wait for the last class to most leave prior to entering the class.**  I know this is a really simple detail but patience truly is a virtue and I'm sure if you were that student just trying to leave you would not have like to be met with hundreds of students trying to go the opposite direction at the same time you are trying to exit. 
2. **Form a line.** Ok this one is trivial but it makes sense. If you really want a seat in a specific spot, start lining up next to but not in front of the door so can get that seat that you desperately need. If you really need a seating accommodation, I'm sure your professor can accommodate.
3. **Say Excuse Me.** If you bump into someone, you know the drill. Pardon yourself and apologize. We're not brutes fighting for food in the jungle.

&amp;#x200B;

I get it, I'm a student too and I'm trying to get the best seat possible but I also allocate enough time to get to class so I can try and get a good seat. I don't push and shove to get to the front. Let's make an effort to be better.

Like if anybody knows if that parking structure near LA Fitness allows overnight parking? (I do have a membership!) 

This whole thing is really starting to stress me out. The only solution I can come up with is buying that R-OC permit and parking my car at the ARC, and just taking the bus to class but thats really a last resort thing.

I already posted this in r/orangecounty but if anybody can suggest something, I’d really appreciate it! Thanks!!"

Hey Anteaters, I’m starting a Yang Gang at UCI in collaboration with the Orange County Yang Gang and we’re looking for motivated students who want to spread the Yang 2020 campaign on campus. Our primary activities will include: tabling, canvassing, fundraising, registering voters, and posting flyers. If you’re in the Yang Gang already I shouldn’t need to convince you any further, so sign up now and we’ll send you more details shortly. DM me if you want to be extra-involved and help run the club, because we definitely need people like you! (also don’t forget to join /r/YangforPresidentHQ)

Never heard of Andrew Yang? Put simply, he’s the Asian man running for president who wants to give every American adult $1000 a month. It sounds almost too good to be true, but it’s surprisingly the best solution to eliminate poverty and prepare Americans for the future as automation &amp; globalization ramp up. He is competing for the Democratic nomination in a highly-contested primary race, and is currently between 4th-6th place depending on what metrics you look at. His 21st-century platform consists of over 100 policies, including:

* The “Freedom Dividend”: universal basic income of $1000/month for every American adult
* Medicare-for-All
* Student loan debt forgiveness
* Federal legalization of marijuana https://twitter.com/AndrewYang/status/1170048318686318593
* Combating climate change
* Giving people property rights over their data
* Reducing cost of higher education
* Eliminating private prisons and reducing mass incarceration
* Much, much more at [https://www.yang2020.com/policies/](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/)

If that piqued your interest, sign up today or stop by the Yang 2020 booth on Ring Road on Thursday, October 17 to find out more. In the meantime, no one can convince you better than Andrew Yang himself, so listen to the first few minutes of his [Joe Rogan appearance](https://youtu.be/cTsEzmFamZ8) and hear why you deserve $1000 a month. Feel free to ask any questions below and I’ll be happy to answer them, whether it’s about the club or Yang’s policies ;)

We're the Undergraduate Business Association, a general business club open to all majors. Lately we've received a lot of questions about business econ, and seen quite a few on this sub too. We decided to compile some of the most frequently asked questions for future reference, since it can be surprisingly difficult to get a thorough answer for some of these. Let's get into it:

**What is the difference between business admin and business econ?**

Business econ (BE) has a much higher emphasis on economics than business admin (BA), and can generally be described as straight economics with a couple business topics mixed in. The BE coursework is about 75% econ and 25% business, while obviously the BA requirements are pretty much exclusively business courses. BE is slightly more math heavy and the general consensus is that it can be a little bit harder than BA, but it's still not too bad for most people. Also, BE is **not** technically part of the business school, and actually falls under the school of social sciences (important for major restrictions and academic advising).

**Should I transfer into business econ or business admin?**

BA is usually everyone's first choice, while BE is the backup. However, less than 10 people per *year* successfully transfer into BA, while BE is relatively easy to get. It is worth noting though that yes, **BE is a valid alternative for BA**, even if it is significantly different. We'll get into that in the next question.

**Does being a business econ major instead of a business admin major affect my career choices?**

For the most part, no. Job outcomes are about the same, most employers don't know the difference between the two majors or don't really care either way. You might get asked why you didn't ""choose"" business admin (even though that's usually everyone's first choice), but as long as you give a good answer about how you really enjoy the econ side of the business world you'll do fine. Either way though, internships are really important as both BA and BE majors in order to start a successful career after college.

**Will I still be able to network as a business econ major?**

Yes. You'll still be welcome in most if not all of the business organizations on campus, which is a great way to network and experience more about what the business world is. 

**Should I get a Merage school minor as a business econ major? I.e. management, accounting, or entrepreneurship**

It's a good idea. What most people don't know is that you don't actually have to apply for the minor in order to graduate with it; if you took the required classes then you get it regardless. Most of the time there are still some spots open when major restrictions lift on a business school class (also, upper div management courses that are online do not have major restrictions to begin with), so it's entirely possible to do. There's a lot of overlap in BE and BA minor classes as well, just make sure to take the business versions of courses whenever you can since often they fill requirements for both BE and the business minors (for example, MGMT 30A fills the accounting requirement for both while the econ version does not)

""The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government is now under the influence of The Chinese Communist Party. The Hong Kong SAR Government has continually failed to listen to its people’s demands and has stripped its people of their rights. The Chief Executive, Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, enacted the “Anti-mask law” by use of the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, in order to bypass all regular legislative procedures. There is no doubt that there is no longer any Separation of Powers nor rule of law in Hong Kong.

We the Hong Kongers no longer have any faith in the SAR Government, and we do not recognise it as the governing body of Hong Kong. We hereby announce the Chief Executive and all her Secretaries, Chief Secretaries for Administration, and heads of all departments unseated and dismissed, in effect immediately."""

The first-ever edition of UCI Test Kitchen starts with the Handmade Banana Split Milkshake, an easy way to curb any cold cravings that the ice cream station might not!

**Ingredients:**

1 slcied banana (in baskets next to the Farm Stand station)

1 scoop of vanilla ice cream (Honeycakes station)

1 scoop of strawberry ice cream (Honeycakes station)

1/2 cup chocolate milk (Second Breakfast station)\*

1/2 cup milk (various; Second Breakfast station)

Granola, M&amp;M's, berries, crushed Oreo's, peanut butter, etc. (optional)

&amp;#x200B;

Combine all these ingredients into a glass, then stir with a knife to help chop up the ice cream and banana. Mix and match with your favorite ice cream flavors, preferred types of milk, toppings, and ratios, then enjoy!

*\*Note: Some ingredients depend on what options the dining hall puts out for the day, so some parts of the recipes may not be readily available for every time of day. Most recipes/locations are based off of Brandywine's stations.*

When I was getting my childhood vaccines I had a moderate to severe allergic reaction which led my pediatrician to stop administering anymore vaccines. 

As a result, I have had ZERO of the required vaccines that UCI is asking for. At first I thought I would be able to submit an exemption request because of my legitimate medical history, but after reading UCI’s exemption policy it even says that if the allergic reaction happened in childhood, it is not a valid reason!!!

The deadline is October 25th and I’m honestly freaking out I will not be able to register for Winter quarter.

Does anyone have previous experience with this? Is it even possible to get ALL the vaccines by the deadline? What do I do.... I know I should have dealt with this earlier but I always thought I would be able to get an exemption.

Here are my main concerns:

Should I still submit an exemption request even though my allergic reactions happened 10+ years ago?

If I begin the process of getting vaccinated before the deadline, will I still be put on an academic hold?

Thanks..."

I do plan to eat dinner on or near campus since I commute and traffic doesn't die down until closer to 7 or 8pm, so the need to eat is there, but I'm trying to debate whether the costs of getting a meal plan is worth it or not.

UCI Test Kitchen serves to help that problem,  creating new food ideas with ingredients found throughout the dining  hall stations.

For this edition of UCI Test Kitchen, we'll be recreating In-N-Out's famous animal fries using Brandywine food!

Credits to u/valorzard for coming up with the idea!

**Ingredients:**

1 patty melt (ask for a cheeseburger without buns at the Ember station)

1 bowl of fries (Ember station)

2-3 pumps relish (condiment table near Ember station)

3-4 pumps ketchup (condiment table near Ember station)

3-4 pumps mayo (condiment table near Ember station)

&amp;#x200B;

**Steps:**

1.) Switch the places of the patty melt and the fries, so now the fries are arranged on the burger plate and the patty melt is now in the fries bowl

2.) Chop up the patty melt into very small pieces using a fork and knife, that way the amount of cheese and meat gets evenly distributed over the fries instead of one big patty

3.) Pour the chopped patty melt over the fries

4.) With the fries bowl now empty, add in the condiments to the bowl and stir well to make imitation ""spread""

5.) Pour the ""spread"" over the meat and fries

&amp;#x200B;

The only missing ingredient is chopped grilled onions, but the meat from the patty melt (outside of being a way to get melted cheese) acts as a tasty substitute. Adjust the ratio of ""spread"" ingredients to your liking, and enjoy!

UCI Test Kitchen serves to help that problem,  creating new food ideas with ingredients found throughout the dining  hall stations.

For this edition of UCI Test Kitchen, we'll be showing off one of the fancier (and more complex) sides of what Brandywine has to offer with bruschetta, an Italian *antipasto* traditionally made with marinated tomatoes on grilled bread.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

2-4 slices of tomato (Ember station)

4 tablespoons olive oil (enough to get the tomatoes well coated; Farm Stand station)

2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar (about half the amount of olive oil you used; Farm Stand station)

1 teaspoon salt (just a pinch, various)

1-2 slices of bread (Second Breakfast station)

Cheese (optional topping; Farm Stand station)

&amp;#x200B;

**Steps:**

1.) Set your bread slice(s) to toast at the Second Breakfast station

2.) While the bread is toasting, pour the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and salt on top of the tomatoes in a bowl

3.) Slices up the tomatoes into very small cubes (this can be tricky, you can instead slices the tomatoes on a plate and then pour them into the oil-vinegar marinade, or just use already diced tomatoes if another station is serving them)

4.) Grab your toast, then pour a \*very\* small amount of olive oil on the toast and spread it

5.) Cut the toast in half, then ladle the marinated tomatoes onto the toast with a fork (this is to prevent too much marinade getting onto the toast and making it soggy)

6.) Top with shredded cheese if desired (white cheeses like parmesan works best\*)

&amp;#x200B;

While not being a true representation of bruschetta, with the lack of garlic and basil, the taste is amazing. This food may be new or unusual to some, but the cooking process is worth it for its deliciously acidic, salty, and summery flavor. Enjoy!

Want to make some good money over weekends and evenings while supporting a great cause? There is an effort to make sure a proper veterans cemetery is built at the former El Toro Marine base at/near the Great Park. They are paying $15/hour or $2 per signature for the signature gathering, which is starting up this weekend. If you would like to help and make some money at the same time, sign up at the link below and say you saw this on reddit and would like to join the payed volunteer effort:

UCI Test Kitchen serves to help that problem,  creating new food ideas with ingredients found throughout the dining  hall stations.

For this edition of UCI Test Kitchen, we'll be making affogato, a delicious Italian dessert consisting of coffee poured over ice cream!

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

2-3 scoops of vanilla ice cream (Honeycakes station)

Any type of coffee (various)

Any type of milk (various)

Chocolate milk (optional for mocha affogato, various)

Whipped cream (optional, Second Breakfast station)

&amp;#x200B;

**Steps:**

1.) Mix your coffee to your liking, potentially keeping it on the darker side as the ice cream acts as milk and a sweetener

2.) Ladle the coffee onto the ice cream with a spoon to your desired amount (test results showed that pouring coffee over the ice cream directly from the mug can result in spills)

3.) Add toppings, like whipped cream, to your liking

&amp;#x200B;

This dessert is perfect for lovers of coffee and/or ice cream, creating a unique twist on the two foods that coffee-flavored ice cream can't achieve, while also leaving a LOT of room for creativity and personal liking. Experiment with ice cream flavors, types of coffee, levels of coffee darkness, coffee-to-ice cream ratio, and toppings, then enjoy!

*\*Note: Some ingredients depend on what options the dining hall puts out for the day, so some parts of the recipes may not be readily available for  every time of day. Most recipes/locations are based off of Brandywine's stations.*

So I'm the type that has always struggled with math, and with severe social anxiety its hard for me to make it to lecture. When I do make it to lecture, I often get distracted or cannot keep up with the pace at which Pluta is moving at, and before long, I've already lost as to what's happening. To compensate for that, I've been developing a playlist of Youtube tutorials for Math 2B which has helped me greatly. It has allowed me to digest topics at my pace and able to rewind and see what I got right and wrong has allowed me to process what is needed for me.  Hopefully someone can find my playlist useful, much of the videos are from the Organic Chemistry Tutor. In the future, I will probably make more playlists to help with other classes as well, such as MGMT courses.   


Anyways, here is the link, and if anyone's part of Pluta's class notices any  any gaps in topic coverage, please let me know!

For this edition of UCI Test Kitchen, we'll be kicking off the weekend with ice cream sodas, including the beloved root beer float!

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

2-3 scoops of vanilla ice cream (use chocolate for the ice cream soda variant; Honeycakes station)

1/2 glass of root beer (root beer float; any soda fountain with a touchscreen)

1/4 glass sparkling water (ice cream soda; any soda fountain with a touchscreen)

1/4 glass milk (ice cream soda; various)

1/4 glass chocolate milk (ice cream soda; various)

Whipped cream (optional; Second Breakfast station)

&amp;#x200B;

**Steps:**

1a.) If making an ice cream soda, fill the glass about halfway with a mixture of sparkling water, milk, and chocolate milk, then mix until foamy

1b.) If making a root beer float, simply fill a glass halfway with root beer (with an optional added flavor of vanilla)

2.) Carefully transfer the ice cream from the bowl into the glass

3.) Top with whipped cream and any other toppings

&amp;#x200B;

Most everyone has had (and loves) root beer floats, but not as many people know of its lesser tasted version, the chocolate ice cream soda (pictured here). Both have their own signature flavor profile, so try out both with different toppings and soda-to-ice cream ratios and see which one you like best! Enjoy!

I work Thursdays through Sundays until 2 in the morning. Then I have to wake up at 5  to make it to my 9am because I take the bus. 

So everything goes smoothly for the beginning of the week, and once Thursday hits, I don’t have time to do anything, which leaves me lost in class, and I get behind on all my work. The weekend is hell because I have to play catch up.

UCI Test Kitchen serves to help that problem,  creating new food ideas with ingredients found throughout the dining  hall stations.

For this edition of UCI Test Kitchen, we'll be upgrading a banana with a lot more flavor, and making a version that includes a waffle!

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

1 sliced banana (basket next to the Farm Stand station)

1 waffle (optional; Second Breakfast station)

1-2 containers peanut butter (Second Breakfast station)

1 cup Cheerios (or other cereal of your choosing; Second Breakfast station)

1 cup granola (Farm Stand station)

1 cup yogurt (optional; Farm Stand station)

&amp;#x200B;

**Steps:**

a.) If making the standalone loaded banana, simply combine all ingredients in a bowl and mix lightly

b.) If making the loaded banana waffle, layer all ingredients on top of the waffle, starting with peanut butter to stick the ingredients better (it's also recommended to put yogurt on this, as without it the waffle can be somewhat dry)

&amp;#x200B;

What's great with this recipe is that even if the line to make a waffle is packed (which it normally is in the morning), this will still be a great tasting and filling breakfast without it, so experiment with toppings and enjoy!

*\*Note: Some ingredients depend on what options the dining hall puts out for the day, so some parts of the recipes may not be readily available for  every time of day. Most recipes/locations are based off of Brandywine's stations.*

I'm aware that I will have to pay the 50 dollar fee for the missed appointment due to my stupidity, but I'm kind of confused on the exact way payment is done for vaccines. I have UC SHIP, so do I need to pay for the vaccine despite having medical insurance under the school, or is it covered by SHIP? I know it might seem stupid to ask, but I am genuinely at a loss at what I need to pay. In addition to that, if the bill is on my record before or during the winter quarter enrollment, will I have an academic hold for not paying the medical fees?

So what could be a few things I can address in the PHS?  How different should the PHS and SOP be and what matters for the ECE department?

Thanks."

It's been awhile since our last post, so here is another invite to join the official r/UCI Discord server! The server is about 3 years old at this point and still going strong! Whether you want to talk about classes, rant about your personal life, discuss anime, post memes, or find people to game with, there's an open place for you here! We welcome Anteaters from all walks of life and encourage every member to participate and be active in the community by going to our monthly real-life meetups or simply take part in the various server conversations. While the majority of the server is ICS/Engineering, we highly encourage majors outside those schools to join. We have members from many different schools who would love to have more people in their major around!

&amp;nbsp;

We know it can be difficult to find like-minded peers to connect with, especially for transfers and commuters, so our Community Organizers work hard to set up server events every month. Our first-ever meetup was a great success, with over 40 people making it out to our poolside BBQ last month! 

Following that, we are actually holding a second event, a beach bonfire at the Corona del Mar fire pits. We encourage everyone, even if you feel like you won't know anyone, to come out, as these meetups are a great way to make some new friends! For more info, please check our #event-announcements chat in the 'Events' category of the Discord server. As a side note, we are a bit thin on drivers to transport people, so if you can give rides that would be great!

&amp;nbsp;

If you would like to help plan future events we still have a form to [apply for Community Organizer](https://forms.gle/ea5CtAvaE4iKFnJJ9).

&amp;nbsp;

In addition, an esteemed member of the UCI community ([@petr_the_planteatr](https://www.instagram.com/petr_the_planteatr/)) is planning on doing a Q&amp;A through the server around week 4/5 along with the possibility for drop announcements through the server in the future! Future developments will be announced on the server.

Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/kM6GnvW

&amp;nbsp;

*As a security measure the server has enabled discord phone verification to ensure the quality of the server, prevent raids, and deal with previous issues of ban evasion. If this poses a problem for you, or you have any questions please feel free to contact Simorin#4229 on discord. Note: Most channels are not shown until a role is assigned.*"

You are basically forced into doing things in order to officially become a member, REMIND me is friendship the thing where you do what you’re told and you obey or where you are allowed to do what you choose, HMM

Friends in frats only stay friends if you choose to stay in the frat, once you leave it’s like over, WOW brotherhood this brotherhood that, oh you don’t like the price of friendship, OK BYEEE

Aren’t the frat friends just glorified drinking buddies, like do y’all actually know how to have fun beyond just alchohol and drugs, or is that not within your capacity

Your self worth is JUDGED, like friends don’t choose each other, friendship happens naturally, but somehow frat friends y’all are chosen based on your self worth and if they don’t like you, it’s kind of like they don’t think you have any worth, like after everything in the end you don’t get chosen, but you had fun with people in the frat, do y’all actually stay friends after the decision I don’t think so

Frats are essentially a gathering of toxic masculinity, OH BRO DUDE, do you see that Alpha Pi gurl, ID DO HER SO HARD, or basically just a bunch of shirtless douche guys laying out thinking they’re so hot

In the end of the day, frat people are not your friends, it’s basically a glorified version of paying for friends, I have no experience but like if you don’t have the rufht look, frats WILL not look your way, I tried approaching a guy from Kappa Sogma and he dead ass turned away cause apparently I’m not FIT enough to be a part of your elitist fake group

“Community Service”: do you honestly think of you DIDNT have to do community service as a Greek organization, Frats would, UMM no they don’t care squat about helping the world, just partying, and I honestly hate the fake love for it by them, do it sincerely or don’t do it at all

Additionally, the “friends” chose you to be their friend, one quick decision change and those buddies of yours, would never exist. I HATE HATE HATE friendships that were created out of decisions rather than the natural, this isn’t a job where your qualifications and experience is looked at, it’s literally a social elitist group.

Frats CREATE problems, because “brotherhood” trumps all rule, even when one of the brothers does something terrible, all the bro’s have to stand by him or else bye bye BEST FRIENDS.

Never join a frat, if you wanna party, do it yourself, if a bunch of glorified douche guys can do it, so can you, it’s just basically drinking and music and good friends those things are easy to get and TRULY you can have a better time around your good friends rather than a bunch of egotistical losers.

I am freaking out because I don’t know what days my classes will be  (most likely MWF but I’m not 100% as the schedule has not come out) or of my professors will be chill with me missing 3-4 classes, which I’m assuming they will not be.

It’s only my first semester at UCI (transfer) so i haven’t gotten a good grasp on how this might play out yet, so i guess I’m wondering if anyone has some insight on this?

By the time I had to apply, this is what I had the most courses done for so I couldn’t apply for BIM. 
My second year of CC I took all courses that transferred to BIM and now, after this quarter I will be only one class away from finishing all the pre major requirements(already finished so many other requirements for BIM other than the pre)

I literally had to fight to get into my upper div management classes this quarter since the major restriction and I did. I’ve checked every detail to make this major change possible. 

Yesterday I had the most disheartening convo with the least empathetic counselor I’ve ever met. She was from ICS and I know it’s her job to give me the info but a little sensitivity would not hurt. Nonetheless, she mentioned the unit cap, the one detail I missed that changed everything. She said if I apply at the end of this quarter I will get denied since I have one more class but if I apply next quarter I’ll still get denied because I’ll be over the unit cap and that I’ll need to appeal. 

I’m so scared. All the classes I took this quarter and the last year will go where?what did I pay for? I can’t be stuck in this major I LITERALLY haven’t taken courses towards it for two years!! So many of those units aren’t even applicable for BIM!
  I’m so worried all my work was for nothing. I don’t even have a Uci GPA idek When I should even apply to change my major?  When do I appeal when I get rejected? What do I say? Do I leave the educational goal ive been working towards and go for a differnt major instead of BIM but what if it’s still the same situation? What if I get rejected there too? I’m so scared and feel like there’s nothing for me here and I just freaking got here. I’ve been fighting for everything here and I’m so tired and lost.

However, I have one C from 2 years ago (first semester), and it particularly stings because it's a math class: multi-variable calculus (not first year calc). This already screws me over for alot of UCs, no matter how well I did after that. I was even giving up for UCI for the most part, since they require a ""B in all major prerequisite courses"" ([assist.org](https://assist.org)). 

But what I didn't realize until now, is that they don't even require multivariable calc for CS. They do for CSE and other majors, but not for CS. I've checked on the official UCI website.  I'm so far missing data structures and machine organization/assembly. In the other courses on assist.org, I have all A's, including linear algebra (have a 5 on the AP calc BC exam for math 2A and 2B). So I'm guessing I have a tiny chance. GPA is a 3.7 (though inflated by GEs). GPA counting all math/physics/cs is 3.51. Math/cs is 3.67. 

Then again, CS is insanely impacted/competitive, so my main concern is how that C makes me look bad, required course or not. Chance me? Anyone got in with a C in a math class?"

ron lived in the same middle earth building as me during our freshman year. he was a smart guy, helping people on his floor with physics homework every week. ron was quite a character though:

 - ron hand-fed and pet the raccoons in middle earth at least once.

 - ron helped start the fight club of our building. we moved the couches off of the carpet in the first-floor common area, and people then wreslted and did sparring whatnot. this went on for a time (the ta/ca were fine with it) until someone got middle earth adminstration involved.


for halloween,  ron the legend walked to utc in his costume: a bathrobe over nothing but [those candy underwear that're nothing but looped candy and string](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/VkkAAOSwYBpdkh6v/s-l300.jpg). apparently, he began to flash people around utc to show off his candy underwear. people thought he was so cool, they called the uci pd so they could see the legend himself. when officers asked what he had underneath his bathrobe, he had already lost his candy underwear somehow, so he had to show the cops his glorious nude body. he could've ended up as a sex offender, but he just ended up only having to talk with the dean of students instead.


ron had to leave uci in the middle of our freshman school year, so he's no longer around :("

I'm looking for 1-3 passionate folks who are interested in being part of a startup. Non-UCI students welcome.

I recently got accepted into the EvoNexus FinTech incubator (on the Applied Innovation campus) for my startup, RoboCash. 

RoboCash is a free mobile application that uses cutting-edge financial technology to enhance phone calls with monetary incentives and destroy the profit motive for spam calls. A free, ad-free, mobile application is given to everyday users, whilst high-volume callers may pay for a premium version.

We're in the app development phase, so we're mostly in need of good front-end mobile developers. We're outsourcing the majority of the work, but I need someone who can understand that codebase and add features as requested. We are starting off with Android (JavaScript) and moving on to iOS (Objective C, Swift) in the later future. 

We're also applying for the Big Ideas competition at UCI. I'd love to have one of you help lead the charge there. We've already got tons of paperwork/application materials from our past competitions.

Perks:Get office space/desk at the EvoNexus office on the Applied Innovation campus. 300 Mbps ethernet speed. 

Get in touch with the folks behind the startup scene here.

Time commitment: \~20-40 hours a week. 

Pay: interns wanted, no pay for 3-6 months. Pay negotiable after our seed round. Equity negotiable. 

Site: [https://www.myrobocash.com](https://www.myrobocash.com)

Team:  [https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-e-garcia-49857232/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-e-garcia-49857232/) and 5 other folks working part time. 

Let me know if you've got any questions."

All of my classes are fine and I'm doing quite well in all of them... except ICS 46 with Pattis. I understand the concepts just fine; his written work is stuff I handle to at least a B range. My problem is I have no idea how to write the programs for the class (I've gotten a 0 on Programming Assignment 1 and I'm likely to get pretty close to a 0 on Programming Assignment 2). I'm not sure if it's me being not very good at coding (it's probably that) or if it's something else, but I'm consistently having trouble even starting on these programming assignments.

Why didn't I figure this out and drop it before the end of week 2? I'd say it was an issue of pride, all things considered. Regardless of what exactly prevented me from dropping ICS-46 earlier, I can't drop it any more and replace it with a different relevant class for my major, so here's my predicament:

I'm thinking about dropping ICS-46 with a W. However, in doing so, I will be going from 13 units (full time) to 9 units (not full time) if I were to do this. I have a few questions about this:

-Would dropping ICS-46 end up with me dropping out of my major? Keep in mind that I am a junior transfer on the first quarter here at UCI.

-If I can drop it and stay in my major, how will this affect the next quarter registration-wise? 

-If I cannot keep my major if my first quarter is not full time, are there any late-admission classes relevant to ICS that I can pick up mid-quarter to compensate for lost credits?

-If I cannot keep my major if my first quarter is not full time, how likely am I to get dropped from my major if I get a D or F in the class? I acknowledge that I have the opportunity to re-take the class again to improve the grade but that's only if I stay in the major.

-To the people who are successful in this class, how do you go about understanding and completing Pattis programming assignments? Do you just know how to start from sheer coding experience without relation to his coursework/lecture notes? If not, what resources do you guys regularly utilize to keep up (TA assistance, tutors, etc.)? 

-Not a question related to courses directly, but where should I go or what resources can I utilize if I feel like I'm not up to snuff with programming and want to ""brush up""?"

Has anyone tried this, and any good advice for a new project?",https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/domrvm/leaving_and_joining_mae_projects_in_the_middle_of/,PlasticSystem,1,2019-10-29 01:12:27,4,/r/UCI/comments/domrvm/leaving_and_joining_mae_projects_in_the_middle_of/,NaN,"So pretty much I joined a new project this school year, it didn't pan out to anything I expected it to be, there's no design work available so not only is it boring but I'm getting grilled every check in for not having any actual design work completed.                    

The nail in the coffin right now is that my 2 design team groupmates pretty much never correspond to any of my messages and its getting kind of old after 4 weeks of barely being able to plan anything. I ask for available times and they obviously put only hours they'd like, and then even do a switcharoo on those times.  Take days to answer messages, asking if they can put files on the drive takes  way too long.... etc.                  

**So my first question is what luck have you guys had with getting the Dean's approval to drop MAE 189**                 

**The second is, what projects do you recommend, that :**

I can join in the middle of the year (maybe start rolling in integrating into the team this quarter). 

Give you more opportunities to be part of the design decisions of the team (rather than just a few people making decisions about design, concepts, and specifications) and giving you busy tasks may or may not be of any use and that would get you grilled every single check in by Walter  (kind of a huge plus). Anything with lots of open dialogue

 It would also be nice if there was more freedom to fail, (benefit)

You don't have to sign up for MAE 189 (optional) 

 I know that was contradictory with getting work that doesn't get you fucked in check ins, but I like the idea of actually being part of the decision making process and having more freedom to fail on something and maybe be able to explore new fields of study more (ME/AE but interested in some embedded/computer architecture stuff for example). I'm not saying this as an exact need, but an offchance benefit                

I'm interested in a lot of topics within ME/AE. This list is kind of based on my experiences on a few projects I've been on....."

Did I fuck myself taking 2B when it was technically optional for COM? Or is it possible that they won’t count the C- for my Math 2B? I planned on retaking it next quarter, but I’m not sure how long it takes grades to come out, and I have to change majors by spring quarter I believe. I’m afraid I won’t be able to change majors by then because I either fuck up Math 2B again or the grade won’t appear until later on.

I was wondering about the rent cost since most apartment leases say $700-800/person but that it’s shared. I initially thought that it was $700 a room and that my friend and I could split the room or whatnot, but I’m guessing $700 is the price for you living with a roommate?? What are the specifics to this? Is there a way to split the cost with several parties (like with my friends) so that we can pay a little less than $700? 

Also, how does financial aid work? Because I’m living on campus this year in a double (it’s like $16k/year) but with my financial aid, I only have to pay $3k. If I rent a place with my friends (in theory, even $700/month would equate to less than $16k/year), will financial aid still be provided to me?

I’m still doing my research but I know the housing application is opening soon, so I wanted to make sure I got everything sorted out."

The Commuter Success Commission is going to be presenting an advocacy project of sorts soon. UCI has a reputation of being a ""commuter school"" yet it lacks the appropriate resources and community for commuters to thrive. We're hoping to get input and support from our fellow commuters on the idea of a Commuter Lounge. Our focus this year will be on curating this space and serving the commuter community.  We see a need for a resource like this for commuters to be able to store their belongs (commuter locker system), store their food (refrigerator check-in system-- cause no one wants to eat out multiple meals a day), bond with other commuters in a common area, etc.

UCSD already has a similar system of 7 commuter lounges with various amenities. We're trying to emulate this system in hopes that we can better support the Anteater community. 

If y'all could fill out this short survey, it'd really help us. 

I, myself, am a shy and quiet anteater just trying to get by and would have really loved having more commuter resources as a freshman. So, to all of you fellow shy anteaters, this is an opportunity for your voice to be heard. Also feel free to let us know what other things you think we can do to help improve your experience here at UCI. And if this is something you think UCI really needs, please share it with all of your commuter buddies &lt;3  Thank you so much for reading this far and good luck for the reminder of your midterms season!

**SURVEY LINK:** [**https://forms.gle/4onpvQyZHwmBhgjd7**](https://forms.gle/4onpvQyZHwmBhgjd7?fbclid=IwAR06dg8JR0ttywU-M5J1yxKiVLwJuIWjj_pn2cXb0fm5pqlF_oq6Nkt05dA) 

\[Note: The cutoff date for this survey will be Nov. 8th at 11:59PM as will be presenting our proposal Nov. 9th\]"

Im a freshman living on campus right now and I need to do housing application in less than 2 weeks for next school year.

I was told I have a guaranteed housing since I’m a full time student living in a residence hall rn for my first year, but does that mean I can live in like Middle Earth tower for my second year? Coz my parents not letting me go anywhere else, and cook and just waste time- they rather just want me to get the meal plan and be closer to campus.

Also, if living on-campus works, would it be weird since there’s gonna be bunch of freshmen with me being second year alone??


What are some of the housing options that people usually choose for the second year?

I was thinking about CV or AV as my second choice since it’s closer to campus, and I don’t know how the monthly payments work. 
Will all of the monthly payments happen through the zotaccount? Or do I separately just pay to the CV/AV housing office 

Also, I have a financial aid that covers some of my housing quarterly payments right now through zot account, will I still get the same amount of financial aid if I live OFF the campus? 


Lastly, I live relatively close so I won’t live here for summer. So my another question is, how to sublease people for summer only? Will the payments also go through Zotaccount page?

As far as I know, Computer Game Science is a mostly-computer science major with a side of game theory, unlike many universities that offer ""video game majors"", which are just game design classes.

It is somewhat strange that I haven't been able to find any public university that offers a video game major emphasising the technical side of game development. It is by sheer luck that I found UC Irvine's Computer Game Science (I was planning to apply for normal CS, but noticed this degree).

However, I am very sure that UC Irvine is not the only university in the entire US that has such a program.

(TL;DR The questions:)

**And so i'd like to ask anyone here who is studying/studied in UCI's CGS Major:**

1. **Were there any other (public) universities you knew that has a mostly-computer science game development major beside the one in UC Irvine?**
2. **If so, what made you decide on UCI over that university?**

... and please don't give me bad examples! (unless they're the only ones). I want to have a variety of options that I can think over. And, best case scenario, if I do stick with UC Irvine over the other choices, I'll be more satisfied studying there since it was a choice I made rather than the only choice I had.

In any case, thanks for your time to read this! Any response would help a lot!

P.S. I do know that a private college called Digipen exists, but I can't really study there because I'm planning to be a transfer student."

I am currently a high school senior who's dream school is to go to UCI since the school specializes in my major for undergraduates and not just graduates. The issue is that I am a dual-enrollement student, which means I have college units already (around 50 something ish) along with my A-G requirements. Currently, I am taking Calculus 1 at the college I am attending and plan not to take Calculus II next semester since I need to take one more class for my IGETC in case I got a CSU. Plus, I'm one class away from getting an AA in Spanish so why not. 

One of my friends told me that if I don't take Calculus II next semester (which is my last), then my Calculus I grade won't transfer and I might have to retake it. This of course worries me cause Calc is a pain in the butt and I've worked really hard.

So, if anyone knows if what my friend said is true or not, I would like to know. Also, I'm directly applying to UCI, not transferring. So though my units will transfer, I won't be using the TAG program. If that makes sense."

something about me. 

-Second degree burn on right hand(blistered all fingers.and hand) And left foot. All my hairs are burned too.

-i explained the poilice officer and firework officer 5times about the cause of fire. Seems they are still investigating on what causes the fire.

-The apartment is a studio
 -Heres what happened: i was spending weekend after midterm.i went to cosco to get a whole pizza.
Ate half of it while watching youtubes. Then went to the kicthen to save my left pizza in the refrigator.

After that i went back to the living room to play ff14. 

Suddenly werid bell started rining from the kicthen. I went then and one of the gas stove had small fire. The problem was that i put too many papers, documents, paper bags on the stove and kitchen because i dont use stove for cooking(had used like only 2times since 2years living). 
I told the officer that the last time i used stove was more than a year ago. He asked me if i used microwave(its on the stoves). I didnt use it at all.

So with bunch of paper bags, small fire became too big in 10-20secs. I panicked and yelled and hit all my neighbors doors because of emergency.

Finally firefighter came up very fastly, worked done. Though i got second degree burned.

The fire fighter offcier came to the hospital to investigate.about the cause of fire. He showed a pic of the kitchen, all destroyed. I asked what about.living room such as sofa, bed, desk, desktop, etc. He said he doesnt think living room got burned but only smoke dmg.
A weird thing is that he said the stove was pluged off.



What now im worrying about is:

1.i have rental insurance, but i have no idea how this sitiation works like this.

2.I have no idea so far about my properties.

Probably my wallet(have license, car insurance, health insurance, debit card, $80 cash, etc) got burned too because i alwasy put my wallet in the kichen (kitchen is placed in front of the door).

Probably my keys(apartment keys and my car keys) got burned too because i always pair it up with.wallet(or is a car key strong and rigid enough against fire?)

my desktop and laptop, passport, citizenship document etc, i couldnt check so far. These are
In my living room but probably burned all broken through firefighters water

 3. About when my 2nd degree burned will be cured. The hospital said probably a few weeks, but i need to work on hw with my right hand.

4.About back to school. i already sent emails with hospital prescriptions to all my professors, and i acknowledged them i wont try to dropout class. 

But in real talk, im at my brothers home(in burbank) rn. Going oc takes 2hrs. probably desktop laptop and wallet in my home got burned or broken(firefighters water).  All my right fingers are still hurt(but pain became better than last night).  
But I still need to do hw and group assignments. 

I plan go back to the school from tmmw or this Wednesday (unfortunately one of my class has participation grade as 15% for overall grade. So each participation grade is as 1.5% of overall grade).

I think school and professors only can offer me class uncompleted or exceptional dropout during quarter. But I wont do that because I'm trynna graduating at 2020 spring. Cant change plan


If anyone had experienced  like this, I will appreciate any of tip. Thanks and sorry for my writing is dirty. Havent slept since last night and still in panic"

I didn't live on campus freshman year and as a result missed out on a lot of the resources I probably would've known about if I did - I don't even know if I have an academic counselor I can ask about this or not.

The whole building is blocked. I was taken to ambulance, I lost all my properties(desktop, laptop, desk, sofa, bed, all outfits, shoes, car keys, license, passport, social security card, us citizenship certification, health insurance, student card, debit and credit card).

Only my car and my life are safe. But I needa go request my car key, license from dmv, social security card, debit card. 
I got second degree burn and smoke inhalation,  but body is getting better.

I'm trying to find a laptop to borrow or buy for school works and working.

Also trynna reach out Red Cross community and Uci emergency shelter to stay until I can go back to the apartment(the whole building is blocked, so
 I and all other residents from 10 different units cant even enter,
 because the fire fighters and insurance companies are still investigating the cause of fire and its potential risk).

I'm staying at my brother's home in los angeles rn. But will go back to OC in this weekend or next week for school.

Already sent emails professors to explain all details. 

I'm worrying about if the OC global hospital requires me to pay cost for the emergency ambulance and treatment at sunday night(my health insurance is La care, so the OC global hospital said me to go see my doctor at monday). Or does my La care insurance cover the emergency ambulance cost in OC?

More shitty situation: I need to take treatment for my injured... the OC global hospital said me today I should go see my doctor because La care doesnt cover of county. So my brother took me my la care hospital today, they said they cant cover me because I have another health insurance(named Blue cross) though its inactive. La care told me I have to get a letter of termination of Blue cross even its inactive... I was confused because I never applied it. 

Yikes, I found reason. It was because uci gets you the school health insurance through blue cross when you get admitted with taking ur $500 from financial aid budget.

So I called the blue cross to request the termination document to send my brothers home... they said its gonna take 5-10days.

Which means I cant take any treatment in nextde10days... shitty thing is the body parts I got 2nd degree burned are my foot and whole right  hands and fingers.
It makes me super hard to walk, and almost cant drive or use laptop yet...


Thanks."

I know this is is a weird community to put it in but being a current student makes me think I have a bit of leverage to do what I'm thinking I may have to do next month:
So at my current pt job the work environment has started to become too toxic and demoralizing at some points and my good team members are all leaving or have left. And the physical labor is becoming too much. I have the least xp at my job but my Supervisors want to groom me into a leader because of my attitude and ethics (not skills imo). 
Here's my idea to jump off what is looking like a ship that's going to sink: I want to find a replacement pt job and start working hours that dont conflict with my current pt job or school but also let the new employer know that I MAY be interested in adding more hours soon after hiring and then cutoff the old pt job after sometime with the new one. I dont want my current employer to think I'm abandoning them but I also want to make sure I get another job as a safety net if things gets worse at my current job.

 And I haven't brought up that I'm still looking for a career pertaining to my degree as a graduating senior.  I just want to leave my current job quietly and successfully without pissing off the guy who gave me my first ever job.

What you guys think?"

According to various online stats, the majority ethnicity at each campus differs. The list below cites the majority ethnicity at each campus:

[**UC Riverside: Hispanic**](https://www.ucr.edu/about/facts.html)  
[**UC Merced: Hispanic**](http://www.ucmerced.edu/fast-facts)  
[**UC Santa Cruz: White**](http://diversity.ucsc.edu/diversity/images/student_demo_2014.pdf)

[**UCLA: Asian**](https://www.admission.ucla.edu/campusprofile.htm)  
[**UC San Diego: Asian**](http://studentresearch.ucsd.edu/_files/stats-data/enroll/ugethnic.pdf)  
[**UC Davis: Asian**](https://www.ucdavis.edu/sites/default/files/upload/files/uc-davis-student-profile.pdf)  
[**UC Berkeley: Asian**](http://opa.berkeley.edu/uc-berkeley-fall-enrollment-data)  
[**UC Irvine: Asian**](http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-ln-ucsb-latino-20150127-story.html)

UC Merced publicly prides itself on having a diverse student body and claims it “proudly serves the most ethnically and culturally diverse student body among all University of California campuses,” its website [**states**](http://www.ucmerced.edu/diversity).

UC Merced’s student ethnic demographics [**show**](http://www.ucmerced.edu/fast-facts) Hispanics make up the lion’s share of the student body at 3,022 students – or 48.5 percent.

Asians and Pacific Islanders come in second at 1,485 students, or 23.8 percent (Middle Eastern students are included in the Asian category if they are U.S. residents). White students place third at 795 students, or 12.7 percent.

📷Next up? “Nonresident aliens,” defined as students who are not U.S. citizens — either undocumented students or international students. There are 333 such students enrolled, or 5.3 percent of the student population.

After that comes 299 African-American students, which makes up 4.8 percent of the student body. The rest are listed as either “two or more races” or Native American, and 1 percent “declined to state.”

About 99 percent of the student body is from California, with only 24 students [**listed**](http://www.ucmerced.edu/fast-facts) as coming from out of state or a foreign country. That would leave 309 as undocumented students – more than the African American student population.

“UC Merced welcomes students of all ethnicities and backgrounds, and we are proud of the support that we provide to the highly qualified, UC-eligible first-generation students from our region and elsewhere who often aren’t exposed to higher education opportunities early on,” campus spokesperson James Leonard said in an email to *The College Fix*.

He added “undocumented students represent all ethnicities and nationalities. We often don’t know how they identify, which makes it difficult to compare that category to others.”

[**RELATED: Tired of Racism Claims, UCLA Student Sets Record Straight**](http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/16312/)

UC Merced also has a “Hispanic-serving institution” designation, handed down by the U.S. Department of Education in 2010. That makes the university eligible for a host of funding and grants from the U.S. departments of Education, Agriculture, and Housing and Urban Development. Interestingly, UC Merced does not offer a major in ethnic studies or Chicano/Latino studies.

[**RELATED: Hispanic High School Grads Outpace White Peers in College Enrollment Rates**](http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/13488/)

In some ways, the student population at UC Merced mirrors California’s demographic trends. Gov. Jerry Brown’s office [**reported**](http://www.ebudget.ca.gov/2014-15/pdf/BudgetSummary/FullBudgetSummary.pdf) in 2014 that statewide Hispanic residents surpassed whites, coming in at 39 percent compared to 38.8 percent, respectively. Asian residents come in at 13 percent, followed by Black residents at 5.8 percent. Multi-race was 2.6 percent, then came Pacific Islander and American Indian at 1 percent apiece.

“As the Hispanic population in California continues to grow, the proportions of the other race groups will decline slightly, except for Asian, which through immigration should sustain its proportion of the population over the next five years,” the governor’s office stated.

When asked whether or not certain ethnic groups at UC Merced appear to be underrepresented, Leonard says “it really depends on the context” and that “our distribution of ethnicities is much more similar to that of the San Joaquin Valley than of California as a whole.”

According to the most recent stats available online, white students are not the most represented demographic at at least six other UC campuses as well, but none of the campuses have such a small percentage of Caucasian students as UC Merced except for UC Riverside, which has a white student population of 15.6 percent, according to its [**website**](https://www.ucr.edu/about/facts.html).

**I found a lost item. How should I report it and how much information am I allowed to give?**

State the item that was lost, where and approximately what time you found it, and whether or not it was returned to a lost and found location (e.g. UCIPD). Avoid mentioning specific details of the lost item so the person who lost it can state identifying details to confirm their ownership of the item.

**Is my schedule doable?**

We can't exactly say what's best for you, but you can consider a couple things: Generally speaking, GEs will be easier than Math/Science/CS courses. 8 am classes are going to be tougher on you than late 5pm+ classes, while approximately noontime is generally the sweet spot. Taking around 3-4 classes (12-18 units) is a good amount and while taking more classes is manageable, it will very likely be tough. If you are very used to studying and high workloads and want to get your credits ASAP, then go for it. Remember that since we're on a quarter systems, classes go by very quickly.

I’ve called and complained this morning because it has finally become too much. They are looking in to whether or not the child is approved to be there, based on that information we will make a decision on what to do. I told them for now there is no need to come out. I figure I can try and go upstairs and reason with them first, before getting anyone else involved. My question is, what do you all think? Am I in the wrong? Am I being too intolerant of others?

She has been in the kitchen all day today, watching her YouTube videos and cooking, which has made it very difficult for me to cook food. She has also had her best friend over for 3 consecutive days now, and they generally just eat and yell at the television characters they are watching. 

Whenever I do laundry, which is usually once a week, she would begin doing hers as well. She would throw her clothes in the washer the instant I put my clothes in the dryer. What is even more ridiculous is that she would then proceed to wash one or two articles of clothing or a kitchen towel and do laundry for nearly everyday after, which I feel is her way of barring me from using it. 

I am not sure why she is behaving like this since she has lived with roommates before. Maybe it's because I'm younger? We're both undergrads, but I am 19 and she is 24.

Also, does anyone have experience with withdrawing and being readmitted to the school of social sciences? I know some departments will auto readmit you as long as you're in good standing and apply within a year but social science has no info online.

Finally, this is a bit specific, but if I'm not currently enrolled, can I still apply for study abroad for next year. I'd like to go next winter/spring but the application is due when I will be withdrawn. Would they make an exception?

Thanks for the help!"

i'm trying to choose which upper div writing to take and since i have a minor in asianam already, i thought it would be good to just continue and take it. i was wondering: 

what the workload is like, how much time is spent doing outside research/interviewing, and if you had fun with the course overall? 

i'm a senior, double major, one of which is under social ecology. i plan on just focusing on my required field work hours for that during spring qrt + 2 other classes i needed and then i can graduate (hopefully) accordingly. 

i wanted to get the upper div writing out of the way before spring so i'm not juggling bet. writing a long paper while i have hours for the field work site. 

and i do know that as a social ecology major, you can both sign up for 195 and 195w - i personally don't want to (i also work part-time so idk how much this will affect the balance of my stuff) but if you think this is the right path to take pls enlighten me too? haha can't you tell i'm lowkey struggling still u_u

Courses are 4 units each. Unless some combination of the easier ones would allow me to take 16 units in a quarter?

Winter 2020:

**CS 206 -** Principles of Scientific Computing - **Xiaohui Xie** (actually available in Spring with **Wayne Hayes** but I'm not sure which prof. is better, having read the opinions)

**CS 230 -** Distributed Computer Systems - **Nalini Venkatasubramanian**

**CS 233 -** Networking Laboratory - **Magda Zarki**

**CS 250A -** Computer Systems Architecture - **Alexander Veidenbaum** 

**CS 260 -** Fundamentals of the Design and Analysis of Algorithms - **Michael Dillencourt**

 **CS 241 -** Advanced Compiler Construction - **Michael Franz**  
  

Winter 2021:

 **CS 263 -** Analysis of Algorithms - **Milena Mihail**

**CS 265 -** Graph Algorithms - **David Eppstein**

 **CS 272 -** Statistical Natural Language Processing - **Sameer Singh**

 **CS 274A -** Probabilistic Learning: Theory and Algorithms - **Padhraic Smyth**

**CS 202 -** Applied Cryptography - **Stanislaw Jarecki**

**The Consortium for Integrative Health Studies at the Department of Psychological Science at the University of California, Irvine** is recruiting participants for a research study about stress, health, and recreational substance use. Participate in research designed to study the links between stress and health behaviors such as marijuana use, exercise, and alcohol consumption. The purpose of this research study is to examine the influence of health behaviors on social situations and the information learned from this study will further our understanding of how the immediate experiences of individuals influence health behaviors. The experiment will consist of **two parts**: a screening survey and an in-lab experiment that will be scheduled after determining qualification. This experiment investigates stress by assessing physiological stress levels, including heart rate measured by ECG and stress-hormone levels in saliva.

You are eligible to participate in this study if you are a United States resident, at least 18 years of age or older, proficient in English, if you do not use nicotine or tobacco, and if you are a **frequent cannabis user (more than once per week) or non-cannabis user.** 

The study will last approximately **two hours**, with an in-person laboratory session and an online 5-minute prescreening survey before enrollment. "

I have been really interested in film for as long as I can remember but I let my family talk me out of it as when I was a senior in high school. In the end I couldn't decide on what to study and went to a community college where I settled on computer science and transferred. However, I hate it so much at cal poly that I have been looking for a way out. I started looking into other schools and found that UCI has a major in film and media studies open to senior transfer applicants for fall 2020. So I went to [assist.org](https://assist.org) and looked up the requirements for the major from the college that I went to and found out that I was only missing one class and my grades in the required classes that I have done are all As and one B. My GPA in college was a 3.4  and I the major doesn't seem impacted so I was thinking of applying for fall 2020 and going back and finishing the class I was missing in community college. I also already have IGETC completed.

So, I guess my question is how hard is it to transfer to UCI for film studies? Do I have any chance at all? Any information is appreciated, thanks."

An example of something (imo) that takes a lot of time but not a lot of work/difficulty is a history class. Lots of memorization and assignments, but it's not thaaaat hard. Depends on the professor and types of papers of course.

So I'm a 4th year at UCI, and I've thought long and hard about my degree in chemistry, and if I should continue all together. I appreciate chemistry and love the work, but after a car accident that I was involved in a year ago, I developed cognitive deficiencies in my concentration and memory. And because of my major's heavy use of difficult chemistry lectures during the 3rd and 4th years, I've noticed that my grades have decreased.   
Like, from solid A, A- range to C+ if I'm lucky.

  
And this just sucks. I used to be at the top of my game academically, but because of the car accident, which wasn't my fault, I've been permanently scarred mentally from being able to achieve the level of academic excellence that I was capable of previously.  And what's more, I thought that if I had just stuck the course, I'd make it out alright. But that simply isn't the case. 

  
Yet, there is a silver lining in all of this because the lawsuit against the person that had hit me had been won. And I shall be receiving a substantial monetary award. Like, potentially life-changing over the coming weeks.  


  
And so now I'm at a crossroads. Should I continue through a degree that is exceedingly challenging for me currently, or should I find a new path to follow? Initially, I wanted to complete my degree in chemistry and then pursue graduate school and finally do medical research. I always wanted to be in the healthcare sector one way or another. But if I change my life path, then I think it would be awesome to go into massage therapy or perhaps to become a chiropractor. Anyhow, even though y'all are strangers that I'll most likely never meet IRL, please give me your thoughts as I continue to mull over my choices.  
Thanks for reading my concerns."

So I have a good friend who's a 3rd year at UCI, and she's thought long and hard about her degree in biology, and if she should continue all together. She appreciates biology and loves the work, but after a car accident she was involved in a year ago, I think she developed some cognitive deficiencies.

Yet, there is a silver lining in all of this because she filed a lawsuit against the person that had hit her and won. Now, she tells me that she shall be receiving a substantial monetary award. Like, potentially life-changing over the coming weeks.

  
And so now I'm at a crossroads. As her best friend, I don't know what kind of advice I should give her. Should I tell her to continue through a degree that is exceedingly challenging for her currently, or should I ask her to find a new path to follow? Initially, I know she wants to complete her degree in bio and then pursue graduate school and finally do medical research. She always wanted to be in the healthcare sector one way or another. But if she decides to change her life path, then I think it would be awesome for her to go into massage therapy or perhaps to become a chiropractor. She's always saying that she wanted to get a hobby with her hands or something. 

Anyhow, even though y'all are strangers that I'll most likely never meet IRL, please give me your thoughts as I continue to mull over what I should tell her. I'm her best friend, and she loves me like a brother. And I only want what's best for her.

I’m new to reddit, currently a 2nd year community college student possibly looking to transfer Fall 2020. I want to apply as a biological sciences major (neurobiology), but the requirements are to complete 1 year of organic chemistry, 1 year chemistry and 1 year biology. I will have the chemistry and biology but I won’t have the complete year of organic chemistry done by the end of spring quarter. This is because I started off as a psychology major and became really interested in neuroscience after a few classes. I do have the psychology major requirements for UCI complete—I could apply for psychology and pursue psych BS as I believe it’s somewhat comparable to neurobiology, but not sure if they would accept a change of major if i changed my mind later on. Is UCI lenient at all about this or would I have to stay another year to complete biology requirements? and if I were to apply as a biology major and put my alternate major as psychology, does that give me less priority for psychology?
Thanks for any advice and sorry for the lengthy post!"

- the time frame of 3 months to learn the front/back end programming
- have knowledge for the future as I believe this will be required by most businesses. 
- will be/currently assembling an “A-Team” to develop a business. I want to be able to more effectively communicate, and spot help with the “A-Team.” :)

So I know for a FACT that I will fail Bio 93 this quarter. I just had a hard time adjusting to college as a freshman. I’ve worked on my mental health and quit my job recently which has made things much easier, but it’s too late in the quarter to make a difference.

I’ve been doing the bare minimum for this class, and I take full responsibility if I don’t pass. But it’s discouraging to say the least. Im a Bio major, and I’m failing my first Bio class. I love Bio, but I feel like switching majors now. 

I’m definitely going to retake this class next quarter, but that will put me a step back, so I don’t even know anymore. 

Mostly I’m afraid that I’m never going to bounce back from this and my GPA will be in shambles. I know that the first quarter is rough for everyone, but I never thought I’d straight up fail a class. 

Do you guys have any advice as to how I can recover from this, or do y’all think I should consider changing my major?"

(They were not left handed either.) 

The midterm was open book and open notes. A little less than halfway into the exam, I noticed how this person was spending a great amount of their time flipping through their notebook filled with their class notes and looking at their notes. They would write only when I began writing. At one point I looked directly at their direction, and they stopped flipping and looking through their notebook and began writing. 

After I had answered every question and checked my answers, I closed my test booklet and turned my exam in; the person next to me also closed theirs at the same time and did the same.

He told me his name was Adam, and when asking for my number I saw that there were less than 5 contacts in his phone, one of them being named 'Chicken'.

I know this may not seem like a big deal but oftentimes, sex traffickers will approach women and ask seemingly innocent questions in order to make them less afraid of them.

The project says that a HashMap should be initialized to use a default hash function. Why is that the case ? I understand he wants all HashMap objects built with the default constructor to use a default hash function that we write. He also wants another constructor that makes a HashMap that uses a particular hash function. How are keys supposed to be hashed by a member variable function if the HashMap is initialized with no keys/values. HashMaps are initialized with some HashFunction and also 10 Node pointers that each point to nullptr. Shouldn't a hash function be used when you add keys to the HashMap so it should be a part of the add function? How/when do you access the HashFunction that is part of the HashMap object? I'm just confused about how we are supposed to use a HashFunction that is part of an initialized object rather than just a member function part of the class. I feel dumb idk.

Then I remembered my place in life when it seemed like everyone's gazes were directed slightly above me... So I snapped back to reality and decided to look behind me. What I saw: Undoubtedly the most beautiful man I've ever seen BY FAR in person or on TV. This Chinese international student probably would've been better off as a celebrity... Looks way better than most of the guys in BTS, and this guy was wearing no makeup/hair dye/professional styling/etc. Honestly, I was so shocked that I was almost hyperventilating (ok maybe a little bit)...

I took out a good amount of loans so any extra scholarship/grant money would be great but I'm just unsure if I'd get any since it says I'm ineligible on CSAC.

Also online it states that MCS can help cover up to 40% of fees, so would this include housing fees?

Any help is much appreciated,

I will probably end up with 2 Bs this semster (took 19 credits) which does shake my confidence in my ability to get a good GPA at UofM. So which school should I attend?

Umich

Pros

More prestigious school

2.5 years at a real uni

Change of pace

Cons

Harder to maintain GPA

Will use up most of my housing allowance

UCI

Pros

I can pocket a lot of my housing allowance money

Easier to maintain GPA

Cons

Less prestigous

Will have to do an extra semster at CC"

I am taking INF43 and ICS32 in the Fall 2019 quarter.

INF43 Prerequisite is [I&amp;C SCI 32](http://catalogue.uci.edu/search/?P=I%26C%20SCI%2032) or [I&amp;C SCI 32A](http://catalogue.uci.edu/search/?P=I%26C%20SCI%2032A), but what's gonna happen if I fail or wanted to retake ICS32 in Winter 2020? Does it affect to INF43 class since ICS32 is a prerequisite of INF43?

I'm a transfer and took ICS31 credit by exam before the first quarter starts.

Thank you!"

I attended a Parking townhall meeting a few weeks ago and the Transportation/Parking representatives told us that during every Week 10 &amp; Finals week people with commuter parking permits (S and P) can park overnight. The only caveat is that if you move your car to a different zone over night, remember to move it back into your proper zone by regular operation hours.

*  (ie if you have a Zone 6 permit but move your car to Zone 4 overnight, make sure you move your car back to Zone 6 by 7 AM)

The regular rules still apply, from between 7 AM and 3 PM, you still have to park in your own zones. After 3 PM you can still move your vehicle to a different zone. After 5 PM you can still park in AR spots.

# Library Info:

* Also remember that Langson &amp; Gateway are open 24 hrs starting this Thursday (12/5). 
* Science Library will be open until midnight this Friday (12/6). 
* Science Library will be open until 2 AM everyday from Saturday (12/7) to Wednesday (12/11).

Hope all of you have a successful Finals Week, but also remember to take care of yourselves and sleep!"

Only 14 legislations have passed this quarter, 11 of which just appointment people to bureaucracy. The remaining 3 are still nothing. One steals funding meant to promote sustainability for random engineering projects. The next is a pet project in Social Ecology. Another makes insignificant changes to the judicial branch. 

Nothing about parking has passed - despite being a campaign priority. They couldn't even get a committee together for mental health. But they do have the time to drop 20g on new furniture.

But let's go back to their obsession with the judiciary. The judicial branch has ruled senate actions unconstitutional 4 times in one quarter. Think about that. The senate has tried to violate the constitution 4 times, and the quarter isn't even done.

The senate thinks it's the Chief Justice's fault. Tonight, they released impeachment documents. [https://www.asuci.uci.edu/senate/legislation/print/?legislation\_number=R55-24](https://www.asuci.uci.edu/senate/legislation/print/?legislation_number=R55-24)

Hi! Does anyone know whether I'd be able to take a class listed such as this (IN4MATX 141) in place of my requirement for COMPSCI 121? I thought of looking to see if Math 3A and ICS 6N was listed the same, since they both count for the sasme credit, but they are clearly listed with an OR.   
Would taking IN4MATX 141 satisfy my requirement to take COMPSCI 121 as a CS major?

Project 4 is only worth 10 points which I already finished, and if I get a 10/10 my grade will be around a 65.

I’m so stressed because I would need at least a 42/50 on the final in order to pass class, given if there is no curve at all.

What do you guys think about my situation? Will there even be a curve for this class, because right now without a curve I would need to pull out a miracle on the final just to pass and it hurts because project 3 made me go from contending for a B/B+ to fight for survival and passing :(

It’s 1am in the morning as I am writing post because I’ve been so stressed out and sad ever since I turned in my UC applications. I am a third year CC student and I applied to UCI, majoring in Biomedical Engineering so I just want to ask for advices/tips as well as the chance of me getting accepted. I currently have a UC transferable GPA of 3.49 so I think Im qualified for TAG? I also was an engineering intern at a medical company so i don’t know if that will increase my chance of getting accepted or not. The main reason why I’m stressed out is because I heard BME is quite competitive and Im fear for my life that my GPA will drop below a 3.4 (bc of physics and calc) by spring quarter. Another thing is that I have like 125 quarter units so I don’t know if that will ruin my chance or not. I don’t know if this might increase my chance of getting accepted but I wrote a pretty solid UC essay. If you know any CC applicants who got accepted into BME OR any stories about BME, feel free to share! Thank you so much you guys!"

I wanted to give an update to how the class is now for anyone thinking of taking it next quarter or at any future offerings.

​
# Updates
​
### Homework
**Last Quarter:** The homework documentation went through a large amount of changes after they were assigned. On top of this some homework assignments gave too many tasks.
​
**Fix:** We updated all the homework documentation, removing contradictions and errors, and have since remove some of the tasks to make them more simple and manageable.
​
### Test Cases
**Last Quarter:** The test cases where either given right before the assignments were due or not at all. Usually when the test cases came out there where still problems with the test cases themselves. This also came with the tests being run on Postman making them very difficult to read or create new tests.
​
**Fix:** We created a Test Suite that contains all the tests. All the test cases are JUnit tests and can be run against the homework assignments easily. It also JUnit so its much easier to read and work with than Postman.
This quarter the tests were not provided at the very start, but the current plan is to release all the complete Test Suite at the start of the class.
​
### Grading
**Last Quarter:** The grading changed during the quarter in order to help students, this included increasing deadlines, and added additional regrades. During the regular grading schedule we had to request for regrades when problems where coming up with fail compilations or simple mistakes in our code.
​
**Fix:** Besides the creation of the Test Suite to ensure better scores we are also creating a Testing Service that you can call to grade your current assignment at any time before the deadline and will give you your score and you can request as many grade requests as you want before the deadline. This change is tentative at the moment as it is still being proceed and should be ready by next quarter. We also added a fixed date for all homeworks to be regraded so students don't need to worry about requesting them.
​
### FrontEnd
**Last Quarter:** The FrontEnd last quarter was made in JavaScript, and was a lot to work in in the week we had to complete the FrontEnd.
​
**Change:** More of a change that an actual fix is now the FrontEnd is done in React, and comes with starter code to help the start of the assignment."

I know that Pluta is well recommended by many students for math 2b but the class have a common final which sucks for all. Qing Nie has bad ratings on rate my professor for math 2D, it is his first time teaching 5B I believe. Both classes fit my schedule and I am only taking 12 units next quarter so I'll have plenty of time to study for either class but I would really want to take a class that is easier like I still don't understand limits/derivatives/integrals lol. My GPA cannot afford another C or D :("

Nobody is out here making fun of swagman or harassing him with sinister intent. Swagman brings joy and unity to the community of UCI. Basically, why should our happiness be compromised for the slight discomfort of one person? And even then, why should you be the one to express said discomfort?? I love you swagman, but if people taking a picture of you and posting on Reddit makes you upset, I'm sorry to say IDGAF. Stop being so swaggy dude!:) Swagman is history; repressing the sharing of swagman culture is the same as destroying our history here at uci.

He is an effective teacher as I've heard stuff from him that I'll never forget. ""HI! I'M YOUR FRIEND! SHOW ME YOUR PRIVATE PARTS!"" - On the subject of C++ encapsulation. 

One thing that any student whose in an a class of his will immediately realize that he talks about his personal life and off-topic subjects very frequently. So when I enrolled in CS 141 with him I decided to keep a tally of every occurrence where Klefstad derives from material related to the course. 

I compiled the data into a graph and basic statistics. As you can see this quarter he went off-topic for a total of 138 times. If we estimate that each occurrence lasted 30 seconds we had Klefstad talking on non-relevant information for 69 minutes which is about a lecture and a half.

Just say yes and enjoy the data!

When I asked my counselor about doubling in Environmental Science and English, she said the Environmental Science major is closed and that no new students could have this major anymore, and suggested me to look at the new Environmental Science and Policy major instead (which according to her, was a more refined policy based major than the latter). I am also considering double majoring in chem/bio or picking it up as a minor, since I have completed most of the requirements of the major from my time as a math major. 

My question is: what is the environmental science and policy major like? I don't have any friends nor have I met anyone with this major as it is still fairly new. What are the courses like, how policy based is it, and how science based are these classes? What are the pros and cons with this major?

How bad is Burley? People I know really did not like her class and recommend against taking her. 

So ultimately, it seems like in comparison between Burley vs. Hughes, Hughes seems to be the better option. Can someone comment on this? Which professor do you guys recommend? Although the trio was supposed to be the best option for the previous bio 93 class, I got my ass handed to me from the first midterm, but improved after that, so I wouldn’t say I’m an exceptionally good at biology, but would prefer a class where extra effort and tryharding will at least yield an A, lol.

I searched up the classes I am taking throughout the year and none of them had a prerequisite of 45c. It was only 46 which I have covered.  At this case does it mean C- is a passing grade or I would have to repeat the course?

No worker could answer/solve my question. When i had problems, i researched through online overnight and learned alot. I still had questions that i couldn't find in online, so I went to offices to ask them directly. The fact was they know nothing. know less than me. I'm serious wondering how they are considered as 'workers' and why schools/companies pay them if that's only things they can do.

I would like to post my personal reasons and what I will put on my appeal letter on this post, but I'm afraid posting here might compromise my chances of my appeal being accepted.  I basically had very minor medical issues during this quarter, and I had very toxic friends, my past was haunting me, along with other personal issues.  


Is my attempt to appeal going to most likely be rejected no matter what my excuses were?   Because it's not like I was in the hospital for a large portion or the quarter and its not like I was homeless or anything, I just had alot of personal issues.  Does anyone know anybody who was in a similar situation as me, and if so, what happened to them?"

I wonder how you managed to become the head of BME.

A teacher is supposed to encourage students into pursuing a particular field, but I don’t think you care too much about that. You lack compassion for students and it’s something you severely need to work on. I’m a good student at UCI with a Gpa of 3.5+ and I managed to get a C even after putting a lot of effort into the class. No one I know has enjoyed your class or has spoken in good light about it.

College life crept up on me in a way I did not expect.

I had to sign the contract for students subject to disqualification which states that I can't receive any grade lower than a C and earn a quarterly GPA of 2.3 for 3 consecutive quarters. This started for me last winter and ended at the close of this quarter. The lowest grade I've received since then was a B, but it looks like this quarter I will have a C- in one class. This is a violation according to the terms of the contract, but it states that I am able to submit an appeal. Has anyone gone through this appeal process and been successful? What was your situation in terms of grades? What types of things will I have to prove in my letter?

I only have two more quarters left until graduation so I am a bit nervous for this process. I feel that I have a convincing case sense I have been doing so well for the past 3 quarters its just this one class that it looks like I'll be receiving a C-.

Still couldn't decide I have to take ICS 51 after ICS 31 or not

Is theres anyone who took ICS 51 right after ICS 31?"

My writing has always been decent (B to B+ range at best), but I worry that continuing on the humanities core class will lower my GPA (to the point where, if I maintain this trend, I'll have 6 B+'s by the end of freshman year), that in retrospect taking Writing 39C and other GE's would have overall been ""better"" for my GPA.

I am a biology major, so I realize that I shouldn't sweat buckets about getting a B+ in a non - BPCM courses and I should focus more on the core biology/chemistry courses - But any advice or tips would be very helpful!"

This applies even if you are not receiving financial aid. It won't give you an individual breakdown of your letter grades for each class, but if you know enough already about your results in some classes, its only a matter of solving a simple linear system to determine what average letter grade you got in the classes you don't know about yet.  Hope this gives people some early peace of mind rather than finding out about grades two days before Christmas!

 I took a calculus course this semester and got an F. My gpa for this semester is around a 2.54. Calculus is one of the classes I need to take to transfer, so I'll have to re-take it again and hope that I do better. 

After doing all the GPA calculations and stuff, I realized that if I can maintain all A's next semester I will still have over a 3.5 GPA (the GPA cutoff for TAG applicants is 3.4). 

If that's the case, will I still be eligible for TAG if I decide to re-apply for it next year? Does UCI only care about overall GPA or do they also consider the GPA you get in each term? Am I screwed?? Here's what they said on their site:

&amp;#x200B;

* Complete 30 semester or 45 quarter UC transferable units (including AP/IB/A-level) by the end of the summer 2019 term for fall 2020 admission
* Earn a minimum GPA of 3.4 in all UC transferable coursework by the end of the summer 2019 term for fall 2020 admission and will maintain a 3.4 GPA in all UC transferable coursework for all subsequent terms
* Complete one UC transferable math course with a grade of C or better by the end of the summer 2019 term
* Complete one UC transferable English composition course with a grade of C or better by the end of the summer 2019 term
* Complete a second UC transferable English composition course with a grade of C or better by the end of the spring 2020 term
* Complete 60 UC transferable semester units or 90 UC transferable quarter units by the end of the spring 2020 term for fall 2020 admission, with at least 30 semester or 45 UC transferable quarter units completed at a California Community College
* Complete all major coursework for your chosen major, including [course prerequisites](https://www.admissions.uci.edu/apply/transfer/requirements.php) and maintain minimum course GPA through the end of the spring 2020 term for fall 2020 admission
* Are in good standing for all colleges attended and satisfy all UC transfer eligibility requirements
* Attend a California Community College during a regular session in your last term

&amp;#x200B;

ALSO idk if this helps but my community college has this policy where if I re-take the class that I failed and get a passing grade they'll replace the F I got with the passing grade. And they'll take the F off my GPA. Both grades will appear on my transcript regardless. Idk which one UCI will look at."

If ANYONE could shed some insight I'd be grateful. I'm gonna contact the Office today around noon but wanted to see if anyone knew anything about my situation: 

 I currently have a Financial Aid Hold on the CR amount leftover from my tuition fees. I am a fifth year undergraduate in the School of Social Sciences and ended up fulfilling all SAP requirements except the unit cumulative at the end of Spring 2019 with 158/165. I never got notified about being on Academic Probation or anything, but I did get a notice of Aid Ineligibility from OFAS.  

I appealed my aid , got my appeal approved and was placed on an academic contract with the financial aid worker telling me that I just had to meet the 165 cumulative by Spring. Unfortunate family circumstances unrelated to my original appeal prevented me from meeting the 165 at the end of this Fall Quarter and in fact I achieved under a 1.5 this Quarter. 

My cumulative is still above a 2.0  and the Academic Status page still shows that I just have to meet the requirements by Spring. I still haven't even received a notice of Academic Probation from the school. So my questions are:

1) Why is my CR disbursement on hold if my plan stipulates 'end of Spring' ? 
2) Why haven't I received a notice of AP for my Quarterly GPA ? Was I even on AP this quarter ?"

eiwan9,I just hate textbooks and these stupid paid programs like Connect,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/eiwan9/i_just_hate_textbooks_and_these_stupid_paid/,jeffreytown,1,2020-01-02 01:48:04,10,/r/UCI/comments/eiwan9/i_just_hate_textbooks_and_these_stupid_paid/,NaN,"2020 comes and here comes my extreme hate for professors forcing me to get stuff like Aplia, Connect, and latest edition textbooks that I don't even use. 

Textbooks are just a rip-off. For example, for my accounting class, I bought a PDF version from Vitalsource for around 50 dollars (which is cheap). Used it twice or thrice, never opened it again, and got a B doing the bare minimum of work. Now of course, we're going to need textbooks for some classes, but the fact that they're forcing us to buy the latest edition when there's literally no difference with the previous edition other than a few words or chapter number changes is just so stupid. I know that a lot of the professors won't allow us to use previous versions. It just sucks the life out of me because textbooks are expensive especially because they want to make us get the latest editions. The funny part is that some of these classes like Writing has that one anteater rhetoric book for $30 and barely any classes open a single page of it. For writing 39B, my professor didn't even mention it after the first week LMAO. For anyone wondering, I got an A- in that class so no one can say that it helps me boost grades or something like that because it doesn't. Textbooks don't increase your grade, it's the quality of your professor's lecture that increases your grade (or if you're good at self-studying).

And now let's get to Connect/Aplia/similar online programs. I have a management class and my professor said Connect is a must. She purposefully designed her entire class around Connect which I just despise. I know that a professor doesn't need Connect and I know that I don't need Connect. My accounting class professor said Connect was optional. My friend who had Connect got an A. Hooray! But I had a B. She was a good professor imo and I learned a lot. Teachers don't need a $125 program to teach a class nor do students need a $125 program to pass the class with good grades. Teachers should make it so that these online programs like Connect are optional, but students could get it if they want to be ahead of everyone. I certainly don't need Connect to get an above average grade. I have sample tests and plenty of other free online resources that I can use. I'm sure that if I spent more than just 2 hours a week studying for accounting, I could've gotten an A. The only time where I can barely accept it is when the entire class is online. Even then I don't like it because it's $75 for Aplia (the program I have to use for my online class) and I'm sure that my professor could've made this entire class free by having students submit homework through Microsoft or something similar to this. However, like I said I'll reluctantly accept online classes using expensive programs like Aplia."

I failed Math 2A and my GPA was so low that I was essentially advised to exit out of the school of engineering in my first quarter. I took 12 units this quarter. Now I have to go undeclared and I'm supposed to submit a formal letter, create an academic plan for winter quarter, and a 7-day plan if I want to be considered to get into Undeclared/Undergraduate. My overall goal is to get into a major business econ by the start of my second year. With my GPA being so low I wanted to take some GE's that would help me boost my GPA, so I registered for econ 20a and Anthro 2A. I also registered for writing 37 because I didn't pass my AWPE prior to getting into UCI and I was told that I have to take it by the end of my first year. I also registered for Math 2B because I don't want to fall behind and it's required to get into business econ.

But here's the problem. I could only enroll in 16 units max + an extra 2 units for UNI Studies 1. I have 20 in total with all my registered classes. So the options that I've laid out is this:

I could drop Writing 37 which would leave Math 2B being the difficult class and ECON and ANTHRO as GPA Boosters. But I would have to take Writing 37 during my spring quarter as a priority and if I fail it I'm toast

OR 

I could drop econ or anthro, which would leave both math and writing, both very hard classes. I would be without one of the classes that I wanted to boost my GPA, so I might lose out on financial aid. But if I don't pass writing, I could still take it my spring quarter.

What do I do, I'm so scared about this next quarter."

ej3slo,I'm making a petition to stop UCI professors from forcing their students to buy overpriced textbooks and online programs.

With the power of the Internet, I'm sure that it can be spread very far. I'm not against professors giving students the option to purchase these programs and newest edition textbooks, but I am against forcing every single student in a class to pay 80-135 dollars to buy the newest edition textbooks that are 99% similar to their previous editions and programs like Connect that are not so useful that it warrants every single student to use it. I posted something yesterday so you can see the full details of what I'm trying to say and examples as well. I think I did pretty alright in trying to explain my case.

Now here is the problem. Schools rarely listen to their students. For example, the lack of labs or writing classes have been plaguing this school for a very long time with students complaining about it numerous times for numerous years. However, UCI can't get it fixed nor do they put in a lot of effort in trying to fix it. I'm sure that the united voice of thousands of students or even tens of thousands of students can make a difference, but I still have my worries.

I also have a question as to who I should be sending this petition to if we get enough signatures. Which office is the best office to send this to? Since this is a concern for every major not just a couple of specific ones, I am a bit stuck on this one. Should I send it to every dean for every school here? Is there a specific office that deals with textbook requirements?

Thank you for answering and/or just reading this. I will make a separate post when I finish making the petition. Be sure to sign it if you agree with my message!

The issue is not classes I’m doing way better than I thought but it’s just the social aspect of it all. I spend most days not even saying a word to people, my hall is so nice yet it’s gotten to the point where I feel so out of place or left out. I haven’t made any real friends and the expectations I had of college being fun and all that have let me down so bad. I see my roommates having fun and going out and all and it’s good to see that but I sometimes think about me and why I’m not like that and it baffles me. I could be pretty social it’s just that every time I get put into a new environment my bubble thickens and it takes so much time to pop. 

On top of that, I feel so out of place whenever I do the thing I mostly love, playing video games. I’m the only one in my dorm doing that while everyone else is studying and it just feels so wrong. I try to be as quiet as possible of course and I try to avoid playing video games for their sake but come on with no friends or anything to do? It gets soo boring it honestly drives me insane I feel like I’ve lost social braincells because of that. I forget to interact or even appear slightly interesting because of how dull my days are. 

I tried joining a club of my interest which is law and you had to pay to get in and I’ve never paid for a club and I just didn’t like the sound of that so I just didn’t even try. I tried joining this other club Helping Hearts or something and I checked their instagram out and I couldn’t even find a clear way to join so I just gave up. Then midterms and finals came in faster than I thought and I got caught up with studying as well as working for the Anteatery. 

I don’t know it just sucks and I’ve noticed this school neglects anything that is not CSI or all that bullshit. As a poli sci major I feel so out of place and it’s just so lame. Im going back tomorrow and I’m just so nervous and feeling out of it knowing I have to go through that again. 

I’m from Compton, CA and I miss my friends and the ghetto I feel like at this rate Ima end up hating my time there and sure i’ll try to get some clubs or something but I don’t know. To be honest is it just me or does it feel so weird when sometimes people act so nice out of no where? Like it just feels so fake, I guess im used to a different environment and because of that I feel so lost and out of place. Im just trying to get by this shitty school doing as Im told and living by the book. 

Anyways, that was my rant."

I know that a fair number of you guys here are already aware of this, but for those who aren’t, there is an official UCI Discord server that is welcome to all! 

We are currently opening a Google survey for winter quarter course chat channels to be added onto the Discord server in order to better help anteaters connect with possible classmates and friends! If you want a chance for your course to be added as a chat channel on the server, please send in a response. Hop on the Discord server to find the link to the Google survey in the `#announcements` channel. We will be closing this survey by 6/11/2020 so be sure to send in a request on time! 

**Please note, the channel is hidden until you have assigned a role.**


**Note:** Course channel requests are not necessarily guaranteed and will only be added if there are a sufficient number of requests for the specified course request. If your course wasn’t included, it simply means that there were not enough requests for it to be added. To avoid clutter and dead channels, we cannot honor every request to be added if not enough people request for a certain course. Apologies!

&amp;nbsp;

**The server also hosts monthly events** for members to partake in and connect with each other in hopes of making new friends and to help build the community. Also keep in mind that the server is not only open to UCI students, but to visitors/interested UCI applicants/students from other colleges as well. We aim to have a friendly community for all members so don’t be shy to join the server even if you’re not a UCI student.

**Important Note:** As a security measure against possible raids/bots and to uphold the quality of the Discord, the server requires users to have phone number verification added on their Discord account to be able to participate and chat on the server. If this happens to be a problem for you, feel free to DM me preferably on discord `Simorin#4229`. Please be aware that none of the main channels will be shown until a user has picked a role."

Is this typical for orange county(bay area native). I'm tryna charge my car, but end up using it's gas engine more since it's cheaper. Last time I checked, electricity(even from non renewable sources) is cheaper than buying gas so what gives?

Charging at home means that I can get about 50 miles of range for about 90 cents to a dollar. Charging in Stanford University yields about 2$ for a full charge. Santa Monica has free charging, and parking my car in the garage for a few hours was about 5$. Even Fashion Island in Newport beach is cheaper than charging on campus(about 2.50 for 50 miles). It costs nearly 8$ to charge my car here. 

I was reading online, and it states that UCI has an increased rate to cover construction and maintenance costs, but I'm calling out their bullshit.  Because of the stupid rates, no one uses the chargers, so I'm sure they are losing money, and how is it that much more expensive to install and maintain these chargers vs being in Newport Beach, or Palo Alto or literally anywhere else. 

If I'm missing anything, please explain to me why this is the case.  If there are any UCI officials informed on the topic I'd love to get input. I apologize for any strong language, but this is a serious issue. I want to be eco friendly, and save cash. Right now I can't do either of those things. It's made me seriously consider renting a house off campus so I can install my own charger and save on parking and gas"

I'm starting a local keto community for UCI people. If you like keto food hacks, like learning about keto, want to get to know other keto enthusiasts at UCI, please keep reading:

You don't have to be on the keto diet to be involved. Many people go on and off regularly. Here are some ideas about what this community can do:

1. Host keto potluck and bbq.
2. Split grocery expenses or share relevant local grocery deals.
3. Talk about what they are eating.
4. Share resources, answer questions.

 We have a discord server: [https://discord.gg/37eeU6K](https://discord.gg/37eeU6K)

We could also experiment with keto supplements, share recipes and so on.  If we have enough people interested, it may become a registered club on campus, but unofficial is fine too.

If you're interested, please start by joining the discord server."

I'm a first-year music major at uci. Academically, i did good during my first quarter, i'm starting off with a 3.6 GPA. I'm not sure where to start when discussing this because I thought about it a lot. I'll try to anyway though.

I feel like mental-health wise, I've hit a huge block when coming to uci. I'm never really happy here; I mean of course I have some good memories here, but in general I've gotten really depressed just being here. By week six i had written a 7 page paper for myself in order to vent my problems out to myself (I like writing), I mean putting my thoughts down helped out for the day but my issues persisted. I guess this is me doing it again, but I make it more concise so y'all can follow through.

I absolutely love music, I've been playing for 12 years and like learning about it. I took some classes at my local cc during high-school and enjoyed the experience, but here I feel very often discouraged from my passion. The professors are good at teaching but the musical subject-matter I'm learning here isn't exactly what I expected it was gonna be; it's focused on classical playing (which i understand is an important part of music, I was trained classically most my life) but my only real ambition as a musician is to be create music for a contemporary audience. I don't want to be part of an orchestra or be an audio engineer (i know there are more job options for music majors but I feel the same about those). In short, i'm not enjoying studying music here at uci and i don't see myself using my degree for something that most people do. I don't want this feeling to eventually turn into me disliking music and quitting my instrument.

I came back to school yesterday and it's not the same usual dread that one feels when starting school again, I felt (and feel now) really terrible right now because i really don't want to be here. I got really home-sick last quarter and I'm feeling it again. I feel like my mental health has even started to decline from being here; i'm depressed, unmotivated, and sometimes even feel like there's no point to life anymore because the best part of my life is already behind me. I feel like after college, I won't be happy in life, living in a system where I'll be working till I die. This feeling has been eating away at me for the past couple of months and I don't want it to evolve into me harming myself or worse. During break it felt less of a break, and more of being saved from my own thoughts.

I'm doing well socially and academically at the moment, I'm worried because I'm feeling my mental health slipping and I don't want that to translate into me starting to fail classes (i'm already unmotivated) and becoming more distant from people.

I want to withdraw from uci so I can figure things out back home. I want to regain my motivation and my happiness, and start doing things like finally getting my drivers license, start producing music and seeing how it works out, and getting a small job somewhere so I can have experience and some money in my pocket. Of course, this isn't my long-term solution to everything. If the music I create doesn't really go anywhere, I would go back to college and perhaps pursue a different field of study like philosophy or english. Generally I just want to be more prepared for life now because I feel like I'm living at a bubble at uci where I'm not getting much done other than working on my bachelors (which I understand is extremely valuable and cannot be regarded as not important).

I also want to make this decision soon because a lot of money is going into attending uci, and I don't want to drop out during my second or third year, which would be more wasteful then doing it sooner. I've also been planning to move in with my friends at irvine if I decide to do a second year, and I don't want to make this decision when the plans are completely final, therefore screwing them over financially. I just really need to some thoughts or input here. Thank you so much for reading all the way here if you did, I appreciate your kindness."

I ended with a 78% in my ""Intro to C++"" course, which is super frustrating because I was 2% away from a B. This is the only major prep course I took so far; the other courses I took were general ed courses that I got A's and B's in.

I find it hard to believe that I've completely ruined my chances of getting into UCI -- or any other UC for that matter -- over getting *one* C during my first semester of college. I still have hope it isn't completely over for me.

Should I go to another community college to take this course for a higher grade? I know it's unlikely that doing this would replace my grade completely since a C is technically passing, but I'm thinking that getting an A or B at a different college will look better than having just a C.

Our application is now open, and can be accessed from your My Aid portal and our website on the [admissions page](https://www.admissions.uci.edu/afford/scholarships/). Just scroll over (or tap, if you’re on mobile) your category and click on the “apply now” link. You all should have received an email yesterday with some information and a link!

What’s new about this whole process?

1. The application is now completely online.
2. We’ve switched from 500 separate scholarships to one single application for all of them.
3. You don’t need to look through eligibility requirements anymore—we will match you to the scholarships you qualify for.
4. NO MORE ESSAYS! We are asking students to fill out a series of short answer questions instead, and only the ones that apply to you. Should be much easier :) 
5. Masters and international students now welcome!

So I guess I could just take a literature class for fun or something instead.

It got me thinking though, about if there are any majors that work well with bio sci and are more ""reasonable"" to take on. Of course, actually adding an entire major especially now would be difficult at best, but I still want to know what the possibilities could be. I think it would be really fun to crushed by a course other than bio sci for once and I'm really interested in making the most of my time here. Any ideas about what majors complement bio sci well?

I know that business administration is under Paul Merage, why is business economics under a different school of social sciences?

To print your own parking permit, you need to take a picture of someone’s parking permit (preferably longer dates).

Then just copy EVERY small detail of the card. The back can be ignored. Example: The font size, font placement, font type. ESPECIALLY the Valid box picture must match. 

I studied multiple permits with varying times and they all differ by minor details which make it easy for people to notice."

Well, that's the hope..

Taking 3 classes right now and honestly they're not that bad, relative to the combination of classes I've had before. And it's just 12 units. I freakin took 16-18 units every quarter from freshman winter -&gt; now because I failed my entire first quarter and I needed to catch up. 

And guess what? I made it through, studied a ton, had an amazing work ethic, and now have a 3.75+ GPA. 

But for some reason now... even though I am taking 12 units, I feel so...tired, burned out, stressed, and worried. 

I just can't find my footing this quarter. I am clouded by the worry and pressure of ""what if I fail this quarter and I can't graduate"", etc etc. It has also hit me this quarter that I spent my whole 4 years studying so hard, and because of that, I don't have very many friends and I feel like I will leave college not having any fond memories. 

So all of these thoughts in my mind are making it super hard for me to study, and now I am so stressed... I am looking at these fucking lecture notes and I can't understand a damn thing because my mind is so clouded. 

Fuck, am I really going to go out like this? Failing with just 12 units, and then spending more fucking money to do a spring quarter? Ending college with memories?"

One of the things she said was this.

""Realistically,  the petition signatures and Reddit post is used as evidence to convince  admin of the issue; the legislation is used to promote that evidence  and explain the issue more; social media is used to circulate the  petition, Reddit, and legislation; and the last step is for student representatives, academic advisors, faculty, and administrators from each school to make materials more affordable,""

Essentially, the bigger it is, the better. When you have a school with thousands, it's essential to have as many signatures as possible. If you haven't signed the petition, please think of signing it and share it with your friends! The best way to spread something is by talking about it to your friends who will then talk to their friends and etc. If everyone on this Reddit signed it, then that's basically half the undergraduate classes.

If you win, let me know what you need, and I'll go buy it and contact you for pickup instructions.

sorry for that depressing intro lol. i'm a 2nd year at uci, i don't really have anyone to talk to here and i just went through a breakup recently; my ex was the only person i really talked to from uci. i made some friends last year but they all commute (i commuted my freshman year) so their schedules are pretty tight, and since our classes don't line up i hardly get to see them. i'm not very close with my roommates, plus even if i were to try two of them are seniors and will graduate in the spring. the other is in her 3rd year and seems busy with her own life. i still hit up my ex because i'm lonely but i feel terrible whenever i do because he's always busy with work or assignments or things of his own and i know he just picks up the phone because he's afraid it might send me into a panic attack if he doesn't. it just reminds me of how pathetic i am... 

i just want someone to tell me that it's okay, that i can take things at my own pace... that i'm not alone... i just can't help feeling like no one really cares... even when i talk to my therapist he dismisses my problems easily and tells me it's nothing to feel bad about, but it just makes me feel worse and unproductive...

So I’m using a throw away Bc I’m super pissed. So we had a bio midterm on Wednesday, and guess what. For all the versions, 4 versions, of the test. The correct answers were all A. In what world is that fair. I honestly didn’t do too bad, I got a 73. But I was panicking that I kept on getting A’s and would put my second answer choice, which was my mistake. I should have brought it up and told a TA or something but I didn’t. Now the teacher says that she is going to change the score that we got to the average of midterm 2 and midterm 3 or just keep this one if it happens to be higher. She hasn’t mentioned regrading, because there is nothing to re grade. She hasn’t said anything about having a curve, because she doesn’t curve. How is this fair. Sorry I just needed to rant, going off at my roommates wasn’t enough.

Anyways, I've been debating a lot on what I should do with my major because not too long ago I had an epiphany about how I don't have many options when it comes to selecting a career in Poli Sci. I've seen the numbers of unemployment rates for Poli Sci a while a back and my friends in high school used to always make fun of me telling me stuff like ""how are you going to an engineering school as a poli sci major, that's the only reason you got accepted."" and sure enough yea, i agree. My SAT was an 1100, I'm stupid in math, I come from a poor area in southern LA, so school were not that great but either way, I'm here. I've set up a meeting with a mentor about what to do with my Poli Sci degree later in life, but he doesn't know I'm also debating on switching majors as a whole. It's not that it's hard or anything, it's a lot of reading yea sure, last quarter I did pretty good, but overall I just don't know what to do with it and I don't know if law school is it for me or if anything in that realm it for me. 

Taking all that into account, I just want to do something I could enjoy and get a good paying job that is not so hard to find right after college. STEM is the next big thing ain't it? With all this talk about space exploration and stuff, it has all resonated with me since I was a kid with all these events and programs and talks. I've loved computers and technology as a whole since I was small too, I was able to teach myself HTML for a bit but you could only learn so much by teaching your own self. 

I figured it was the last straw on whether or not I should switch to Comp Sci literally 30 minutes go when I saw a guy coding in my Gen&amp;Sex class. I started thinking to myself, ""damn that looks so interesting and cool, I wonder if its hard or if I would even survive."" And since I had been debating on my major anyways, it hit me hard. And now I am here, hoping to seek advice or anything of the like. Here goes nothing."

As you may have heard in news reports, the CDC and [Orange County Health Care Agency have confirmed](http://www.ochealthinfo.com/phs/about/epidasmt/epi/dip/prevention/novel_coronavirus) a positive case of the Novel Wuhan Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Orange County.

We have been informed this individual is not a UCI student, faculty, staff, or patient. However, this is a serious matter, and we continue to monitor the situation. UCI and UCI Health have implemented measures to protect our community should a patient be identified in the future.

We realize that there are many questions about the virus, its impact, and what it means for the UCI campus community. The FAQ below is provided to help answer basic questions about the virus, to share steps for keeping yourself healthy, and to provide guidance if you feel that you have potential symptoms or exposure.

Any member of our community suspecting they have influenza or the Coronavirus should stay home. Students should call the Student Health Center at (949) 824-5304, or call their primary medical provider prior to arriving at the medical office. This will allow us to provide you with information on your illness, and to plan for your visit to the clinic, if needed. Faculty and staff should contact their provider’s office for additional instructions about seeking care.

The campus continues to operate normally. As the campus and medical center leadership continue to evaluate the situation in Orange County, we will share updates by email and on the [Student Health Center website](https://shc.uci.edu/).

We appreciate your cooperation and support in protecting the UCI community.

**Coronavirus FAQ – Jan. 26, 2020**

**What is the Coronavirus?**

The 2019 Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) comes from a large family of viruses that are a common cause of mild upper respiratory infections, but also include both SARS and MERS, which can cause more serious disease. Most patients with coronavirus have mild symptoms, however this new virus has resulted in cases of severe illnesses and deaths reported in China.

To learn more about the coronavirus, the CDC website is a reliable source of updated information: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html

**What is being done to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus?**

To reduce further spread of the infection, Wuhan City and nearby areas have implemented travel restrictions. Airports in the US (including LAX), are now screening entering travelers from certain areas for symptoms of respiratory infection.

Locally, this is an evolving situation. The campus and medical center are in coordination with Orange County Health Care Agency resources and the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) to provide ongoing clinical guidance.

**Have there been any POSITIVE (2019-nCoV) Coronavirus cases on the UCI Campus?**

No, we are informed there are currently no positive Coronavirus cases on the UCI campus or at the UCI Medical Center. Detailed information of confirmed cases in the U.S. can be found on the [Centers for Disease Control (CDC) website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html) as such information becomes available.

**Is there a vaccine for Coronavirus, and can I be tested for Coronavirus if I feel unwell?**

There is currently no vaccine for Coronavirus (2019-nCoV); however, the CDC and the World Health Organization (WHO) are working around the clock to develop one.

The only current testing for the Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is done at the CDC Laboratories in Atlanta, Georgia. At this point, testing is only performed for patients who meet all of the clinical and travel criteria.

**What should I do if I think I have the Coronavirus?**

If you have a fever and symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough, difficulty breathing, or shortness of breath:

* Stay Home from school/work if you are having symptoms
* Wash your hands and stay well hydrated/drinking fluids
* Cover your cough, and avoid close contact with others
* Call your healthcare provider to make an appointment

If you have traveled to Wuhan, China, or have been in close contact with someone who has recently traveled to Wuhan, China, within 14 days before the onset of your symptoms, please notify your provider/clinic BEFORE entering their office. It is important to call so that your provider/clinic can be prepared for your visit.

The UCI Student Health Center has developed triage screening (by phone and at our front desks) and has implemented additional protocols to help identify possible cases of coronavirus to provide optimal care for those with symptoms and to protect other patients and staff.

UCI Students should call Student Health Center at (949) 824-5304.

UCI Faculty and Staff should call their healthcare provider immediately for care.

**What can I do to help keep from getting the Coronavirus, or other infections?**

* Wash your hands frequently with soap and water
* Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth
* Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces at home, work, or school
* Practice healthy habits: get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids, and eat nutritious food
* If you have not received your annual flu shot, please visit the UCI SHC website to review the schedule, and schedule a Flu Shot visit

**Do face masks protect against coronavirus? Do I need one?**

For now, public health officials say there’s no need to wear face masks in the United States; however, there is likely no harm in adding this additional layer of prevention, especially for people who think they may be sick.

Health-care workers interacting with coronavirus patients or suspected cases will follow CDC recommendations to wear the N95 respirator mask, along with other precautions like gloves and eye protectors.

**How will I know if things change/there are any cases at UCI?**

The UCI Student Health Center will continue to screen and identify possible cases of Coronavirus. We are committed to providing optimal care for those with symptoms, and to helping ensure appropriate treatment and exposure prevention. As the situation changes and we have new information, we will send timely updates to the campus community."

The UCI Student Health Center has developed triage screening (by phone and at our front desks) and has implemented additional protocols to help identify possible cases of coronavirus to provide optimal care for those with symptoms and to protect other patients and staff. UCI Students should call Student Health Center at (949) 824-5304.
UCI Faculty and Staff should call their healthcare provider immediately for care.


**What can I do to help keep from getting the Coronavirus, or other infections?**

* Wash your hands frequently with soap and water
* Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth
* Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces at home, work, or school
* Practice healthy habits: get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress,
* drink plenty of fluids, and eat nutritious food
* If you have not received your annual flu shot, please visit the UCI SHC website to review the schedule, and schedule a Flu Shot visit


**Do face masks protect against coronavirus? Do I need one?**
For now, public health officials say there’s no need to wear face masks in the United States; however, there is likely no harm in adding this additional layer of prevention, especially for people who think they may be sick. Health-care workers interacting with coronavirus patients or suspected cases will follow CDC recommendations to wear the N95 respirator mask, along with other precautions like gloves and eye protectors.


**How will I know if things change/there are any cases at UCI?**
The UCI Student Health Center will continue to screen and identify possible cases of Coronavirus. We are committed to providing optimal care for those with symptoms, and to helping ensure appropriate treatment and exposure prevention. As the situation changes and we have new information, we will send timely updates to the campus community."

Ensure all students have access to medical supplies.
Students’ attendance to classes must be optional.
A committee must be formed to raise awareness and monitor the disease.
Offer mental health support to the students in need.
Students' names and contact information must be recorded when attending large events. 
As the coronavirus spreads to Irvine, my fellow schoolmates and I are experiencing tremendous fear and concern over going to crowded places such as lecture halls, and campuses. We wanted to take precaution measures, but all masks are currently sold out in the Irvine area. We all have schoolwork to do, social events to participate and seminars to attend. But we do not feel safe going to school and public places, especially with a confirmed case here in Orange County. 
Many students with flu-like symptoms refuse to stay at home for fear of missing lectures, but they are running the risk of bringing the virus to campus. We truly hope that the school can take appropriate measures and close all campuses to prevent further spread of the virus.
Now orange county does not know how many contact carriers or patients in the incubation period, for the sake of the safety of the entire UCI, to stop the current course, students in a fixed area is the most reasonable and the most safe way.
We must carry it out now, without delay!

I went to try to take a Chinese Quiz at the designated location by my instructor. Upon arriving, I knocked on the door of the room where the test was to be held. It took multiple knocks before finally the door was unlocked by a student and I was let in. I quickly take a look at my surroundings and realize this isn't my class. Before I could move the ""instructor""(White Man) runs up to me and grabs me at the shoulder. I politely brush it off and tell him ""Not to touch me"". He then rudely asks something along the lines of ""What the f\*\*\* are you doing here"", I ask him politely if this was Chinese class or if he could direct me to the appropriate location. He says something along the lines of ""No, leave, get out Chink, are you blind?"". At this point, I'm pretty offended, but I restrain myself. I simply say ""Alright"" and as I leave, he says something like ""Wait, I got your Chinese Class right here"" he then points to a dark empty corner of the ground far away from him and says ""Go"". I remain silent and head towards the door and he yells from ""If you come in here again, I'm calling the cops"". I don't remember if he made any other remarks - a lot of comments about race that were too much to list ""Ching Chong"" and such and talking to me in a belittling, sarcastic manner. Fortunately, I was able to find someone who gave me directions to the appropriate building of my class.

I’ll be finishing up all GE’s and all of my major requirements (I am a Bio Major). 

However, I’m about weary with reapplying because I’m scared I’ll family academically. My experience when entering UCI was not the greatest and I am a bit scared that I won’t do well (once again). 

I was not disqualified from UCI, I withdrew due to personal and family reasons and also I honestly think I was not mature enough to understand what I was getting myself into when I was first coming in as a Freshman. After spending some time at my local community college, I feel like I’ve matured enough to know what I want my future to be. 

Again, I’m still weary that I won’t do well academically. The course load at UCI was very rigorous for me, and I’m just scared that I’ll end up disappointing not only myself, but my family. 

Any tips to get rid of this mindset? Also, any tips of doing well at UCI as a bio major? Bio at UCI is known to be rigorous (obviously). Nonetheless  I’m doing well at my community college, but that honestly does not increase my confidence if I do go through with the readmission process at UCI."

Slashing tires of vehicles belonging to the people he argues/tries to physically fight with (and yes hes been caught)
Verbal harassment towards people, (women and children included)
Trying to instigate fights

The excuse for his behavior being allowed to persist is always something about medication access or they just hold him for like a day or 2 at most then hes back here at the apartment complex doing the same shit all over again. This guy just instigated a fight today with my dad and my dad took this guy down in quick fashion. A few hours later somebody vandalized my mom's car....wonder who did that. Not saying he did it but when this neighbor gets embarassed, he shows his crazy side. And his ""family"" always tries to cover for him. This guy harasses both my parents for years along with some other neighbors he tries to fight with. And the neighbor always puts up a facade in front of people...including police.

I have an idea of persistently recording this guys behaviors whenever hes outside and catching him in the act of instigating conflict on his own. But idk if I can legally do that. Obviously his behavior is unacceptable and hes not getting the help he needs but nor should my family have to worry about him trying to physically harm them or their possessions. 

What can we legally do? By the way its Santa Ana PD that always comes here for him."

This means that 73% of the student funding, which comes from all UCI student fees, are going to be allocated directly to updating engineering equipment and upgrades. Without making it accessible to other non-stem schools or campus resources that are currently understaffed and underfunded. 

We understand the need for the Engineering school to have state of the art equipment for student projects, but for the majority of student funds of the proposed allocation to go just to one school department is frankly inequitable. While also just having one campus resource center (Veterans Service Center) receive funding while leaving out other equally impactful centers (i.e Dream Center, Transfer Commision, LBGTQ Center, etc) is unfair and should be reconsidered. 

Please we ask if you can make your presence known during public comment at the Senate meeting on Tuesday, Feb 4th at 5 pm in Wood Cove BC. If you cannot be present during the meeting you can also email your major school senator that represents you. Emails and information of who they are will be linked below. Make it known that you/we are advocating that the majority of student funding shouldn't just be 

1. allocated to just the Engineering school which has been historically the most well-funded school dept on campus. 

2. Establish a more equitable process in which some part of that money can go to campus resource dept that are open and serve all students on campus (i.e DSC, Womxn’sHub, FRESH Hub, etc)

3. Open funding process for all student majors to apply for student led projects from all school departments

Day 1: Maintenance comes and cleans up the mold doesn't know what the root problem is.  
Day 2: The RA's tell me to get in touch with the leasing office who tells me to get in touch with the RD.  
Day 3: RD gets in touch with me says they can meet tomorrow (my signing deadline).  
Day 4: I get an email from RD nevermind he can't meet today, I go to the leasing office to see what I/they could do (absolutely nothing), look my lease over, the deadline is 12pm, it's 1:30. Sucks to suck.

I recently decided to double major in English and realized that taking a language is a school requirement. I’m a junior now, and seeing as it’s the second quarter, I don’t have much time to finish the series and would have to test into Spanish 1C or 2A to graduate on time and avoid summer classes. In high school I took Spanish for three years and am a little confident that I can test into at least 1C, but I’m also scared that I’ll just be thrown into it and won’t be as advanced as everyone else is, or that I won’t know some/ a lot of the material as I haven’t taken Spanish in four years. Can someone who’s taken 1C fill me in on what to expect and what you do in 1C? Is it super hard? How much Spanish do I need to know or brush up on? (Will we be talking in only Spanish in the class for example?)"

Thank you for participating in this discussion on homelessness in Orange County. Nothing is more important to me than listening to the members of our community. Hearing opinions from you and others in Orange County truly helps me represent our community. 

I look forward to hearing your questions and thoughts. I'm especially eager to hear if you were surprised by what you read, aware of homelessness in OC, or impacted in anyways by the homelessness crisis.

i already took gen chem a few years ago at a community college. I took one semester during intersession (5 weeks) which included 5 days a week of 5.5 hr lectures, and 2 days were lab. There was a pre lab, obviously ridiculously long lab meetings, and post lab in addition to the lecture tests. 

That being said, it's pretty dire that I complete 1LD by the beginning of this fall, versus taking it during the fall.
If I eat/sleep/breathe chem for those 5 weeks, and have pre existing knowledge, would an A still be possible in all 3? I'm not sure how labs work at UCI, i'm new.
I've heard courses over the summer are easier, but i've also seen threads of people complaining about 1C &amp; 1LC in one summer session

P.S: To be more technically, the psychology department is offering Psych 112C and LC but you need to have taken another psychology lab (Psych 112B) before. They aren't offering any other Experimental Psychology Lab requirement, so anyone in my position that needs this requirement satisfied (which could be a lot of graduating seniors in psychology) cannot graduate cause its not offered in Spring."

To give a bit of context about myself I’m really interested in economics and mathematics but I haven’t really met any people in the lgbt community that are.  I’m quite open minded when it comes to talking about the field of economics (I would probably fall in the mainstream school of economic thought as center left.  A balanced monetary and fiscal policy would lead to a good economy) and the various theories that are out there but I’ve yet to meet someone in the lgbt community that is.

Don’t get me wrong, most of the dates I’ve done on here were nice people.  I just didn’t feel like we clicked.  Oddly enough I would prob date a good portion of my friends but they are all straight.

Art 8 asks why so many don't see themselves as ""creative,"" even though they creatively solve problems all the time. If we all have creativity within us, how can we reach our creative potential? Using media, texts, and hands-on projects, the course will look at the theory and practice, of creativity.  Specific examples, works, and studies will be examined, as well as the role of creativity in everyday life. Cultural differences toward creativity will be explored, as well as how nations are building “creative economies” in a postindustrial age.  Taught by Professor David Trend known by many students for GE courses like Art 9A (“Media, Art &amp; Technology”) and Art 9B (“A Culture Divided”)."

Why don't they install those sensors at the Plaza Verde parking lot? It won't fix the crowding, but it would make it so people aren't always constantly driving up and down looking for parking. They install them pretty quickly, so it wouldn't be any major construction cost I don't think. It'd just be a nice, small quality-of life-change.

It's a really frustrating waste of time/ gas the way it is, and probably isn't great for car emissions in the area."

people voiced their general thoughts/complaints, and healey noted that these complaints would be most effective if put in letter form to be read by faculty during their meetings. once people put their names on written complaints, faculty can take it up to proper authorities (e.g. dean) to get changes and funding whatnot. yea, i could start a doc for uci email domains only, but it'd give away my identity, hur hur.

complaints eecs fellers brought up. i noted which majors gave the complaint, but it could be shared by all eecs fellers.

 - ce: more technical electives! specifically more software electives.

 - ce?: there's only one firmware class

 - ce: eecs 170a feels like an irrelevant chemistry/physics class for computer engineers

 - ee: most lab equipment broken

 - ee: after eecs 170a, eecs 170b only goes into mosfets, but eecs 170c goes into bjts and mosfets. it would be preferable for eecs 170b to touch on bjts.

 - an ee person wanted to avoid c programming in eecs 10 and have an eecs class for matlab. there was some controversy here. there is a matlab course in mae though.

 - transfer students felt lost in classes that required knowledge in python cuz python wasn't a requirement for transferring in.

 - general complaints about professors ignoring emails and instances of professors ignoring questions in class

 - a few others i'm forgetting

other notes/insights by healey:

 - professors are hired by their research, not by their teaching ability

 - when reviewed every 2-3 years, faculty are graded on their research rather than their teaching ability

 - eecs would like to teach more classes, but there's not enough eecs faculty to do so

 - healey offered midterm evaluations when he was a new teacher, and he said it helped him teach better. he's stopped now cuz he has a general idea of what'll be on the midterm evaluations. he advises new faculty to do midterm evaluations as well to learn how to teach better from student feedback."

**Context:** I'm from Canada and got accepted into both UCLA and UCI for biomedical engineering Master's program. My objective is to (eventually) become a research physician so I'm planning on transferring to a PhD within the year. I also picked these schools because they have affiliations with medical school and I really want to do research with more direct applications in the hospital sphere. Plan B is R&amp;D in biotech companies which is why I applied to California school since there are way more opportunities in California than in Canada.

**Question**: I'm looking for advice on which of these schools would help me best to get there or if I'm better off staying in Canada. If there is anyone that went through grad school at either of these universities, how was it? Also, did you confirm who your PI would be before accepting? 

PS: I'll also be posting to the UCLA subreddit to get some input from both sides :)"

f4nmsh,Learn Excel in ICS-7 (given only in Spring Quarters),https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/f4nmsh/learn_excel_in_ics7_given_only_in_spring_quarters/,repattis,1,2020-02-15 23:57:04,20,/r/UCI/comments/f4nmsh/learn_excel_in_ics7_given_only_in_spring_quarters/,NaN,"I am teaching ICS-7 in the Spring quarter, with Lectures on MWF from 3:00-3:50,  
with a Lab in ICS 183/192 every Thursday from 2:00-3:50. Last Spring was  
the first time that I taught the class in 5 years, so there isn't much known  
about it circulating among undergraduates.

Although this class is named ""Introducing Modern Computational Tools"", it is  
all about working in Excel. It is a rigorous introduction to Excel, exploring  
all sorts of important general spreadsheet features, as well as pragmatic nooks  
and crannies. It goes well beyond what students learn in a typical High School  
or Community College course. ICS-7 satisfies the Quantitative Literacy (Va)  
General Education requirement at UCI.

Here is a quick breakdown of the topics by week

 1: Formulas and special functions  
 2: Cell control: inputs, \[conditional\] formatting  
 3: Reference functions: Index, Match, Lookup, etc.  
 4: Naming: variables, functions, and macros  
 5: Charting and Importing data  
 6: Databases and Queries; Boolean-formulas, Pivot Tables and Charts  
 7: Arrays in Formulas  
 8: Visual Basic I : functions, assignment, selection  
 9: Visual Basic II: looping and input  
10: The Excel Solver; course review

ICS-7 is a low-numbered class, so it requires no prerequisites: I will teach  
about Excel from the ground-up. But, there will be a good amount of reading (my  
notes) and you will practice developing/debugging many spreadsheets using what  
you learn.  So, you'll work a lot but you'll come away knowing a very useful skill.

This course is open to all majors/level on campus on 2/24. Questions?

Well, I know someone who knows someone else working for Lathrop in 171 as a grader. For those of you wondering more about what the ""scheduling delay"" that Lathrop was talking about on test day was, you might now have the answer to that (please remember that this information may not be entirely accurate or even close to being so). Here was a text conversation the friend of the grader had with my source (edited slightly for better grammar and capitalization):

Grader's friend: Ok so my friend said they got the message to print the midterms at 12:09 (21 minutes before class). Now I guess it was 12 pages and there's 300+ people in the class, so that's not feasible to begin with. There was some other stuff that happened with her, like Lathrop wasn't in his office and the DBH admin wasn't there.

Person I know: Lol I didn't know they delayed the printing that much.

Grader's friend: Then around 12:40 they find out that the printer jammed. Then when they actually get the tests they find out some of them have major typos because (I'm not sure if you know this already) they made each TA and reader write a new question and I guess no proofreading happened.

Person I know: I didn't know about the new questions being written. You mean that each TA and reader had to write problems for the test? No wonder the midterm was fairly different from past exams.

Grader's friend: Yeah that's the impression I got. I'm not really sure if that's supposed to be public information lol maybe don't share it. The whole thing sounds like a disaster.

Person I know: Lol I might leak it some day but probably not now. \[The conversation starts to go on about the ""free"" question everyone could choose to get full credit on, and on other stuff.\]"

I would like to ask this question for my brother who is a senior in high school. He wants to major in computer science but I know that his math background isn't that solid but I don't wanna discourage him, you know. Could you, computer sci majors, let me know how much math is involved in your major? I mean math isn't hard I just think that the professors at UCI suck at teaching it (there are exceptions tho) so are there any good professors that teach math well in your majors? Also, how about coding and stuff are professors good at teaching the material? 

Thank you!"

Art 8 asks why so many don't see themselves as ""creative,"" even though they creatively solve problems all the time. If we all have creativity within us, how can we reach our creative potential? Using media, texts, and hands-on projects, the course will look at the theory and practice, of creativity.  Specific examples, works, and studies will be examined, as well as the role of creativity in everyday life. Cultural differences toward creativity will be explored, as well as how nations are building “creative economies” in a postindustrial age.  Taught by Professor David Trend known by many students for GE courses like Art 9A (“Media, Art &amp; Technology”) and Art 9B (“A Culture Divided”)."

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Could you help us understand how emotions buffer people against stress experienced by immigrants?  


To participate in this study, you need to be 

1.       International students or second-generation immigrant and

2.       In college or graduate school

You will only take some short online surveys (25 minutes long). We don't collect any information on immigration status or physical address. 1 in 5 participants will win a $25 Amazon gift card. We also got IRB approval. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**This research can help identify more protective factors for immigrants with fewer resources.**  **Further , this study hopes to contribute to reducing health disparities in immigrant families.**  If you are willing to help, please reach me by direct message.

Thank you!"

I hope you are having a wonderful Winter Quarter. I want to invite you to register for an exciting new course taught by Professor Alexandru Nicolau and PhD Candidate Neftali Watkinson called “Programming for Edge Computing”. This is the first time it will be offered. The objective of this course is to learn about the programming challenges that come with distributing computing among edge architectures, including, but not limited to managing cloud services, optimizing code on edge devices, setting up a fog network, and many other interesting topics. We will start with basic applications, scaling up to a final project where you will be doing Machine Learning on the Edge.

Since this will be a hands on experience, you are required to bring a personal laptop and a Raspberry Pi (3B+ or 4). You don’t need to purchase any book (all reading materials will be made available to you) and a big part of your grade will be based on projects. We will show you how to setup your environment but you should feel comfortable programming in Python (if you have taken ICS 33 you will be fine).

For more information, you can either email me (watkinso@uci.edu) or visit https://sites.uci.edu/edge/. I can’t wait to see you there!, Space is limited so get your spot as soon as possible, the course may be found as CS190 with the enrolling code 34386."

I'm a third-year English Ed (Literature Emp) student at CSULB graduating Fall 2020 with a 3.5 GPA.

Don't get me wrong. I really like the education I'm getting in CSULB, but I just want to diversify my academia and I think UCI's program is a great fit for me. It's a closer commute,it looks as challenging as it is rewarding, it comes with a master's degree, the majority of the teachers I love came from that program, etc. 

I was wondering if anyone has any advice for me for doing my best in the application process.  Like, what the application process is like, what they really focus on in the application, etc. I got rejected from UCI's undergrad, and I don't want to feel that sad rejection all over again."

The counselors have been managing to avoid the question every time I am there or tell they aren't sure because it is dependent on your rank in your graduating class.

I maintained above a 3.65 GPA my entire time at UCI and graduated with a 3.730 GPA. I have had friends who graduated (in Spring 2019) with 3.6 or so get Cum Laude on their diplomas but have not heard anything about it myself. I thought it could possibly be because I graduated in the summer it may not apply. I did some research and found that for the CS school they consider graduating classes from summer to spring so maybe they will determine honors at the end of the Spring quarter 2020.

Do any summer graduates from the HSSOE have any insight for me? Thank you in advance!"

I don’t want to stir a fuss, but I’ve been wondering if maybe there happens to be someone who feels this way or even somewhat feels this way.

I am currently a Junior, and I go home on the weekends (I live in LA, specifically San Gabriel Valley, 626 anyone? 😁) Every weekend. I know I’m missing out! I know, I know. But... it’s just that I feel like I should go home to help out my parents and spend some time with them. I worry about them and don’t want them to be lonely. Then again, my parents and I are kind-of boring people, we don’t do much and don’t talk that much. Also it’s kind of hard too, because sometimes they would get in arguments, so there’s tension at times and it makes me feel strained. 

Back at home, it feels as if I am back at UCI. I feel like my relationship with my parents slowly dissipates (not sure if this is a good word to describe this scenario) due to my reluctance and hesitation which just negatively influences communicating with them (I am trying my best though! I did open up with them about the situation). 

Back at my apartment at UCI, I feel distanced from my roommates. It’s hard because my roommates who live in the other room seem to get along with each other. My roommates are pretty good people. It’s just that I haven’t been doing so well mentally so I don’t want to ruin the atmosphere. I pretend everything is okay when I am around them, but inside I feel like caving in. 

Don’t get me wrong, I really appreciate being at UCI, it’s such a great opportunity to expand my horizon and become a better version of myself, but I don’t feel like I have progressed a lot. I am not the doing good academically and admittedly, I am pretty lonely (nobody’s fault!), so I am not doing good socially too. 

I also just don’t have any friends. I know that education should be my priority, but I also believe my time would be more enjoyable and I would even be doing better if there was someone I could hang out with and turn to. I do long for a friend. 

Sorry if this was slightly convoluted in anyway, my eyes are a little tired but...

Let me know if you go back home on the weekends too! If you happen to be from the same area, let me know if you are down to hang out!"

Signing this petition would **not** be approving the fee initiative; it would simply allow us, the student body, to eventually decide and vote on the fee initiative in the upcoming election through a democratic process!

For context, I'm a high school senior awaiting a response after having applied to UCI for CGS. My plan, if I happen to get accepted, was to major in CGS, minor in art, and join the Video Game Design Club. Ultimately, my goal is to get into the video game industry as a concept artist/illustrator (hence the art minor), however because that's a rather difficult subsection of the industry to break into, I felt it would help to get some programming experience as well under CGS in case that plan goes to the wayside (as I've heard CGS is oriented towards the technical aspects of game design).  


However, from what I've heard, CGS is a bit of a mess at the moment, and a lot of people from CGS transfer to CS (with VGDS as their main avenue for game design experience) because it's a much more solidified program. Based on that, I was wondering it would be better to transfer into CS--considering my intents and purposes--and if so, is it difficult to transfer between those two majors?

Additionally, I looked into UCI's minors, and it seems they don't have a ""art"" minor. The closest thing to it is the Digital Art Minor, but based on the classes it has, it seems it's scope is less focused on digital illustration and art fundamentals, and more focused on all art forms that utilize digital media (music, film, etc). Based on that, I was wondering what might be a good way to dedicate time towards improving my art portfolio in case art isn't available as a minor?"

  Or should I enroll courses after I receive financial aid?
  
  This is my second quarter in UCI. I am confused about how summer financial aid works. Can you cover summer fee by financial aid directly on website? Or, summer financial aid only give you money/check, you need to pay summer fee by your credit card?

For those who don't know about the Womxn's Hub, it is a space on campus open to all students that seeks to provide a place of comfort, welcoming, and togetherness for anyone who might need it. They have been a resource on campus since 2016, and in those four years, they have been moved around multiple times, stripped of funding, and undermined by administration on campus. They were even once forced to be located in the back of Lot 5, where nobody goes.

Two days ago, legislation was heard that would put the Womxn's Hub Resilience Referendum on the ballot in the upcoming Student Elections. This referendum would take $2 per student per quarter and put it towards funding the Womxn's Hub and its programs. 33% of the money raised would be re-distributed back to students who benefit from financial aid. This money would go towards expanding programs, events, and workshops. You can see a full breakdown of the fund distribution [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oi2ksGqgbDAQzVNFiiqiUwB3hclk7ROp3Aq-enjbipI/edit). The ASUCI Senate, with a vote of 8-8-4 (yes-no-abstain), voted to strike down the referendum without even allowing it to hit the polls.

Overall, this money would provide stability to a resource on campus that has been publicly criticized, attacked, and undermined for as long as it's been available.

**Still not sure?**

Let me breakdown some of the major criticisms of the referendum.

*Why should I be forced to pay for a resource I'm not going to use?* 

That's a great question, and it's one I've been getting a lot. This resource is, first of all, open to all students. Even if you don't identify as a womxn, you are free to take any of the tea they leave out, check out a book from their library, or just hang out. Also, **you actually can opt out from your Zotbill** if you decide $6 a year is too much for you to support Womxn's rights.

*Won't this disproportionately affect students in poverty?* 

Also a criticism I've heard a lot recently. But there are actually a lot of reasons why you shouldn't worry about that. Like I mentioned before, there is an opt-out option. Secondly, if you do decide $6 a year is too much to pay for the Womxn's Hub, consider that **the ARC fee is $264 and is automatically charged to students**, thousands of which do not use the ARC to begin with. Same goes for the Bren Events Center fee ($69) follows the same principle. Another reason not to worry about impoverished students in this case is that 33% of the money raised from this fee goes back to students in need of financial aid.

*Will a signature contribute directly to benefiting the Womxn's Hub?*

Yes and no. Technically, a signature will not help give money to the W-Hub as the approval of this referendum would only put it on the ballot. This encourages democracy among students and invites another issue to motivate student voters. But a signature will give students the opportunity to make informed voting decisions on an item that affects more than half of the undergraduate student population.

As you can see, there are almost no downsides to signing this petition. Either you care about expanding Womxn's rights unlike the ASUCI Senate or you want to encourage voting and democracy among students, something the school has historically struggled with. (Fun fact, UCI has the lowest voter turnout in student government of all UC's).

Please share with everyone you can and thank you for signing!"

one specific question is: do I need to be affiliated with any “political group” on campus to even have chance? I only ask this because I’ve been reading uci reddit threads about how certain groups control the senate and I wanted to know if that’s the case, then I might reconsider. 

If anyone can provide ANY advice, pointers, or their own experiences running and campaigning for any position in ASUCI, please reply or PM me. Any info you guys have would be AWESOME.(:
