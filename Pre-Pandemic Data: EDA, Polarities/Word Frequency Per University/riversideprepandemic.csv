I will make an appointment asap when the quarter starts again since I already emailed my advisor, but no response. 

IF anyone understand what I am talking about OR anyone in the same situation, please pm or share your ideas. Thanks!"

After some thinking, I thought it would be a good idea to gather some major specific advise for all the new incoming freshman that probably have many, many questions. Of course, there are always going to be new questions, but this should help out people get a general feel of things at UCR.

I've already asked a few people, so it's a good start. I don't exactly know how I will organize this just yet, so to submit, *please DM me the tl;dr answer to the following questions*. They can be in number format or in question - answer format. This just makes it easier for me to copy and paste.

(There are a lot of incoming freshman that are CS majors, so if upperclassmen can help me out with all info you need as a first year, that'd be great!)

---

***I've only thought of a few general questions, if you know that there are questions that are always asked (you can look through the sub), you can answer them too! Just use the format.***

**1. What do you expect from your major?**

**2. What are the requirements for your major?**
*(for CS, that'd be laptop specs, for sciences, it'd be like..... you need a lab coat or something, idk - I guess this is catered towards CS majors? Or if there are any art majors out there!)*

**3. What are things you wish you knew about when you were an incoming freshman?**

**4. What resources (specifically for your major) on/off campus that were helpful to you?**
*(this includes CLUBS, where to find internships, networking, where you found your textbooks, etc)*

**5. What are common struggles with your major and how do you deal with it?**
*(this isn't meant to scare or discourage anyone, I'm hoping for advice! There are many moments where classes make you think ""maybe my major isn't for me,"" even if it doesn't really have to do with your major. I hope that there are specific things you can keep in mind or something about professors/office hours/advisors that you recommend to go to. I think this would put ease onto people that think they're struggling alone!)*

**6. What are things you can start early on?**
*(I thought of this question last second cause I know there are many situations where linkedin/resumes come in handy very early on. I know EVERYONE should be doing this, but there might be some specifics that I don't know about)*

---

Questions for alumni, or anyone with an internship/job for your major:

**6. Where/how did you find your job/internship?**

**7. What do you expect from it? What do you have to do?**

**8. What does this help you with?**
*(Not sure about this question, I would think this is something like, it helps you get a job in ___ easier, or if you do this then you can do ___, it can lead to ____, or it just helped you learn more about something?)*

---

I hope that wasn't too long of a read or if blocky text hurts your eyeballs. I want to help out as much as possible :)

Shoutout to people that I gathered already! AND shoutout to all the regulars that answer questions throughout the sub. I appreciate it!"

First some background, with in the past week and a half or so I went to see some academic counselors, changed my major and as a result basically had to redo my schedule. Without getting too specific, I was recommended to take a certain course if possible and to pick 2 other courses. There were a couple seats open for that recommended course, but discussion sections were basically taken up or the ones with openings were offered to students in the waitlist. So I waitlisted myself for one of the discussions in hopes someone would drop since the course can't be added without a discussion section.

My mistake was waiting for this course and not signing up for something else as a back up so that I'd be full time asap. As a result of holding out too long I stupidly didn't notice the most recent payment due date and held on past it. Because of that my account was declared delinquent and had a registration hold placed on it, so I'm unable to register. My financial aid usually covers me if I'm signed up full time (it should since I was awarded a similar amount and had no major changes in my financials), but since I only have 2 out of 3 courses it only kicked in partially and I have to pay. So if I want it to kick in fully I need to register full time, but I can't register since my account was declared delinquent until that amount is paid hence the catch 22 (no DPP available btw). Besides this I've pretty much always been in good standing.

I can attempt to pay that amount with a credit card so I can register and hope the financial aid fully kicks in, but assuming it does kick in, does anyone happen to know if that amount gets reimbursed once it kicks in and if it does is it automatic? At least that's what happened if one made a payment for something that's covered by financial aid by my old CC. If I make that payment and it doesn't get reimbursed I'm pretty screwed.

I tried emailing the financial aid office, but they seem pretty backed up. 

TL;DR If a payment that's normally covered by financial aid is made does it get reimbursed once financial aid kicks in full, if so is it automatic?"

As the title states, I'm taking 19 credits. The reasoning behind this is that I am spending a lot of money just to be here and not loading up on classes seems like it would be a waste. I am taking 5 courses, 2 of which are easy ones, one medium, one difficult, and another that seems like it could be medium or difficult. I come from a high school that had an extreme study culture, many students from my high school go into college and find that the workload is easier than that of our high school. Admittedly, I was not studious in high school and don't expect college to be a breeze for me. However, I feel that my school has prepared me to somewhat handle the workload I'm taking on. I feel very motivated about taking on this challenge, even in knowing that I wont have time to socialize. However, maybe I'm just being stupidly ambitious. I'm considering dropping my most difficult class, since it has little to do with my field of study, so that I can relax a little during my first quarter. So what are your guy's thoughts? Do you know of any experiences from people who stacked up on classes like this?"

Step 5: ""Click on Manage DUO Mobile App"" and add your device

Step 6: Follow the on-screen instructions

After that, you're good to go. Now when you log into anything through the school there will be an option that says ""push verification"". Clicking on that will send a notification to your phone and all you do on your phone is press approve. The notification even shows up on an apple watch if you don't want to take your phone out. I hope this information helps you as much as it helped me! And if you already knew about this then good job for being smart."

I moved into a campus apartment 2 weeks ago, my roommate had already been living in it over the summer. On move in day I came in to find the kitchen and bathroom to be kinda grimy. I wasn't happy about that. I moved in, and met the guy the next day. At first he seemed normal enough. I tried making friends with this guy but we just didn't vibe. That's fine, I don't want to be best friends with the guy, I just don't want to be on bad terms since we're stuck living with each other for the next year. 

95% of the time he's in his room doing his own thing and honestly its for the best. Sort of. He doesn't go out much and even though we have separate rooms I sometimes wish I could be home alone lol. Whenever we do run into each other we chat a little but sometimes he just doesn't stop. He told me about how his old roommate was a dirty fuck and it bothered him and what not but apparently it didn't bother him enough to clean this place thoroughly. 

I finally had enough free time yesterday to give this place a deep clean. We talked about cleaning together but he's all talk. But it bothered the shit outta me tho so I scrubbed this place down. He wakes up at like fucking noon after a long night of being on the computer and doesn't even really say anything. I told him to keep it clean and help out next time. He apologized profusely and goes on to talk about how he's always tired and blah blah blah. 

I'm honestly over it already. If you're reading this man: you're lucky I hate living in filth. Clean yo hairs up off the bathroom counter that shit's GROSS!!! And I have a feeling you've been going thru my stuff in the bathroom 'cause I've walked in to find my medicine cabinet open a few times. What the hell.

Lmaooo I hope y'all are having a better experience with your roommates than me!"

This is the most insane but completely non-fiction story you will ever see. It is however having trouble getting traction, and getting censored\\banned. Some of the ways this is happening are explained in the update section near the end of the document. Media is currently ignoring this story. This is an effort to create public awareness, so that bribes, blackmail, censorship, and secret deals cannot allow these vile criminals to maintain the status quo, and remain in office.

Billions in bribes were paid to Trump, Pelosi, Schumer, Harris and others to enable a Soros, Koch, and Porter funded child raping ring to operate in the USA. Below will contain excerpts from the 84 page PDF document which can be downloaded near the end of this post. **Please download** **and listen to the links below.** **Turn up the volume and put headphones on.** **You will hear these people and many other high profile people, incriminate themselves in unbelievable fashion.**

\\\\Please post this anywhere you can! Create your own posts with this or other excerpt from the PDF. This information keeps getting blocked, censored, 'down/voted' etc. These people are extremely wealthy and throw money to anyone who will help them cover up their child rapes , child murders, and corruption. This is usually done through a receivership transfer where you receive the funds after for or more day, and it can be pulled at the last second, which is usually the case after you've done them the ""service"" as they call it. Please help get the word out. Soon it will no longer be able to be ignored.

A word about the ""faggot"" usage: it was a necessary tool. It showed three things: they were not in control of the situation, if they were the usage would have been stopped. Everyone out there needed to see this, as it was contrary to the picture they were painting. Two, it made it unpleasant for them to be in the telepathic headspace \[see reference item G in the PDF\], which has obvious advantages. Three, it pointed out impersonators of B.S. in the headspace, because they would not call each other “faggot”, and in turn giving themselves away thus helping to mitigate the spread of false information. Apologies for those unintentionally offended. On that note, I give you former President Barack Obama in a foursome with Peter Thiel, Jack Dorsey, and Matthew Porter. It is on page 12 of the document where you can download the video containing audio footage of the ""event"". Link for the PDF is just above under ""Full 84 page document"".

Excerpts of the dialogue:

&amp;#x200B;

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi returns to the Porter camera system at 1031 for a check-in. ""Nancy Pelosi is here and she wants $3 billion to keep the border open at Monterrey. $3 billion dollars to keep that shit open do you believe that?"" Matthew Porter commentates. Pelosi states 1034: ""I think he \[Brian Schlenker\] needs to be removed. I think we need to get this guy out of here"". Speaker Pelosi then agrees to call back at 7pm PST. Gigi Hadid at 1034: ""Thanks for calling us. I've got you down for three minutes"". Pelosi don't worry about that I've got 3 billion.  

&amp;#x200B;

1031 Matthew Porter: Nancy Pelosi is on and she wants $3 billion dollars to keep the border open at Monterrey. Three billion dollars to keep that shit open do you believe that?

1033 Nancy Pelosi: I don't think that will be necessary unless you insist.

1033 Donald Reeves?: We insist.

1033 Nancy Pelosi: Ok then I guess we have a deal.

1033 Matthew Porter: Thank you Mrs. Pelosi.

1033 Nancy Pelosi: Please call me Speaker Pelosi.

1033 Nancy Pelosi: We want to make sure you have safe passage at Monterrey.

1033 Matthew Porter: We appreciate that Speaker Pelosi.

1033 Gigi Hadid: I think we may have to scale back a little bit though.

1033 Nancy Pelosi: Gigi I think we'll be just fine.

1035 Nancy Pelosi: God damn it! I want Kamala to get a billion out of yours, not out of mine.

1035 Gigi Hadid: I think we can accommodate you but we need to find out if Monterrey will be open on the 30th of January.

1036 Nancy Pelosi: Of course it will Gigi.

1036 Nancy Pelosi: $3 billion goes a long way Peter.

1036 Peter Thiel: Excellent answer.

1043 Gigi Hadid: I think we need to give Kamala a billion dollars to keep her \[happy\].

1043 Matthew Porter: I think we can do that but we need to get her to do something first.

1043 Gigi Hadid: She did. We got her fucking Rahm Emmanuel Monday morning \[14Jan\] at 235. 

1043 Matthew Porter: Perfect, then we're all set. Send her the billion.

1043? Nancy Pelosi: She'll accept the money, I guarantee it.

1043? Gigi Hadid: Nancy thank you for everything.

&lt;ch4&gt;

1036 Donald Reeves: Don't listen to her. She will close down the border if it's not there. Make sure she gets the $3 billion.

You might want to save this post. It will be censored when this account logs off.

Earlier at 11:27, New York Senator Charles Schumer checks in on the Porter camera system. ""We're jerking off to Brian Schlenker, we want you to join us."" says Matthew Porter. ""Obviously I can't jerk off with you, but I can keep watching him in the apartment."" replies Senator Schumer, who also comments: ""...crazy that you expect me to stay here while you jerk off. As crazy as this shit is, it's pretty fucking funny."" Download the video, turn the volume all the way up and put head phones on. Video link below:

I’m not trying to bash the school and if you love it here I’m happy for you and it is a great school, for myself I just don’t love it. 
The teachers are fine, the classes are fun, challenging/easy, overall just fine. But hot damn are the people I’ve met just shitty!
I’ve talked to multiple people in many classes and only met very entitled, rude, and humorless people. 
I know it could just be those classes but I can’t seem to meet anyone that’s funny and can make a single joke or people who don’t only consider themselves. Once people learn I commute they stop talking to me as well and it’s getting impossible to make friends The only friend I met was out of necessity to review some math work. Whenever we meet up to do that she’s hours late and gets mad when I ask her where she is. She says she has no classes when we schedule the meet ups then she bails and says she got the answers from someone else so she doesn’t want to meet up anymore. So I commute hours earlier to get here and help her and hopefully get some help back on a few questions then she does that shit. She, along with two other people from different classes, done the same thing. 
Everyone here has a staring problem too! No matter what I wear, how I walk, where I look, I guarantee someone stares at you. Everyone here is so judgmental. 
Also the guys I’ve interacted with have been so gross and I see them hit on girls while chicks are uncomfortable all the time and sometimes I have to be in those stupid situations. People have been rude and this isn’t so “open” and “inclusive” as they advertise. 
Yes I am grateful to go to a college and I choose this college to stay close to my significant other till she graduates (I graduated a year early so she’s still in senior year) then I’m going to one further away that I was accepted into. In the meantime, I thought this school would be adequate but I feel like I haven’t learned jackshit and I feel like everyone here sucks actual ass. Sorry you may be cool and all that but I’m not talking about you I’m talking about all these cunts I interact with daily. And that concludes my rant let me know if you relate or tell me to fuck off in the comments because you love it here. Show me a fucking personality, they’re rare here."

I’m not sure what classes the 2nd quarter LC block gives but I’m pretty sure it will give me cs13 based off the recommended EE course plan which differs from the CS major course plan which takes cs12 and math/cs 11.  What I’m wondering is should I drop my LC and try to enroll for those classes and will those classes fill up instantly? I need to take cs 12 to even meet the requirements to switch majors.

As a CHASS major (Business Economics), I'm required to take up to the 4th level of a language or test out. I think this is absolutely ridiculous because I'm paying a lot of money to take something I don't want to take and will never need in my career, but let's continue. **A little heads up, you have to take the placement test in order to take a language.** **You can only take the placement test once.** If you have no classroom or home experience with a language UCR will most likely deem you ineligible to take the placement test. In other words, if you don't have past experience with a language you probably can't take it. So I ""opted"" to take the Spanish placement test. **Also the placement test cost $30** or something, charged to your student account.

# My Background with Spanish so you can compare yours: 

 As a SoCal native I feel Spanish is too common to feel exclusive and cultured by learning it. I'd love to learn an exotic language such as Greek, Italian, Russian, Chinese, or Japanese. Sadly, these languages are either complex or uncommon so they were not offered at my High School. In high school I ended up choosing Spanish over French and Tagalog in order to please some relatives. **I took the minimum 4 High School classes or ""2 years"" required for application to the UC system. My high school classes were focused on learning basic but necessary vocabulary and verbs/conjugations.** I got As and Bs but wasn't a fan of the classroom environment. I also traveled to Oaxaca, Mexico for a month the Summer after I graduated high school. In short, Immersion didn't work for me at all because people talk fast. I spent two weeks reviewing for the placement test by religiously practicing Duolingo and taking Various online practice placement tests (Google ""Spanish Placement Test""). Duolingo was a good review of the basics and the practice placement tests were challenging at first but I was able to do well on them after some review. 

# The Actual Test:

**Its multiple choice, you have an hour,** if it takes longer than 30 minutes you are probably getting placed in Spanish 1. **Most questions are fill in the blank using choice a, b, c, or d**. I don't want UCR to hunt me down or anything so I won't say anything else. **It would help to know every single individual word in the Spanish dictionary**. I wish I could help you more but to be honest, I wouldn't know where to start. My strategy was to translate what I know and estimate what I don't. This was a losing strategy and **I failed** (got placed in Spanish 1) because I didn't know enough random Spanish vocabulary. **I'm not saying the questions were asking explicitly for these definitions but, if you don't know them, you might as well be taking the test for the wrong language**. You will barely be able to read the question and you won't be able to read the answers. For example, this was not a question but, Define: ""la red"" from memory. If you answered ""I have no idea"" or anything except for ""the net"", that is what I'm talking about. **A large portion of the test revolves around your knowledge of rarely used vocabulary.** How often will you say ""the net"" in Spanish for your major?

# The Rubric: 

Here is a little Rubric to estimate how you'll do based on what you know. This is a rough estimate meant for managing expectations. Hopefully you place higher than I predicted. If you place lower, Im sorry but the schools expectations are more ridiculous than I thought. Also, check last paragraph. 

**Minimum Spanish for UC Requirement AKA Some Spanish :** You are going to be place in Spanish 1. I'm pretty sure there isn't a Spanish 0 so don't waste your time studying. Hopefully you start Spanish classes your 1st or 2nd year. You'll still be able to graduate your 3rd or 4th year. 

**Extra Spanish, You are Extremely Confident with the Spanish you learned in high school :** You are going to place in Spanish 2, review a little and if you are as confident as you say, you'll do okay. 

**AP Spanish, you can't really speak Spanish but you know a lot :** Congrats Spanish 3. You should still be mad about not being able to use your AP credits to fulfill this requirement. 

**AP Spanish and you are confident, you can probably have basic conversations with those fluent but need clarification on some words :** Congrats Spanish 4. Depending on your major, you may have tested out and I envy you.

**Fluent Speaker, raised for this :** Spanish 5+. I envy you. Spanish may be common at UCR but don't take your ability for granted. I'm sure that even after finishing my required Spanish, I will not be close to your level of fluency. You truly possess a power I'm sure I will never understand.

# Why I Wrote This:

I wrote this in short because I felt cheated. I saw a separate post where someone said something along the lines of ""I barely know any Spanish and I tested out"", I'm gonna say they either know more than they realize, the test got harder, or they work for the school and wrote that so you wouldn't bother reviewing. I studied my ass off for this and got nowhere. I was hoping to finish all my required classes and possibly graduate early and that would have been possible had I tested into a higher Spanish. In other words I am unable to obtain my Business Economics degree in 3 years because I don't know enough Spanish. The main reason for this is that **you can't stack foreign language classes / take more than one in a quarter**. I have to take 4, I am a third year, it's fall quarter and I just took the placement test. **I'm one of the lucky ones because some people will place into the same class spring quarter going into their 4th year, meaning they can't graduate in 4 years**. This brings us to the underlying social problem with this placement test. The school is taking advantage of the unstackable nature of foreign language courses. They win when you lose. If you test low, you take more classes, and the school gets paid more. They have incentive to make it hard. **Foreign Language classes are the Mother of All Non-Major courses.** 

Here is something else to think about regarding Foreign Language Courses. For a lot of people at a school as diverse as UCR that Foreign Language might be the language they speak at home. I have to pay more because that's not the case for me? Where is the merit in that?

# Is it hard?

**It depends, do you know Spanish at a level beyond the standard high school level? If not, probably. Can you study for it? Not really, you can't learn a language to that level of fluency in the time you have till you take it.** Is that fair? I don't think so."

His lecturing is terrible in my opinion, he doesn't go into to much detail and i feel like when he does its rare. He mostly just jumps around or goes on tangents. And his slides are empty, there is little to no information on them that using them to study does not contribute or help my understanding of his class

His study guide is just too much, he has 30 terms, 6 case studies , and 40 short response prompts on it and he also told us that the study guide with all of this might not cover everything on the test as well as he hasn't told us the format of his test rather he gave us an I don't know response and just tells us bring both a blue book and scantron.

My passion is building esports programs on college campuses. I think every school in the country can benefit from an esports program and I'd love to see one at UCR. One of the biggest challenges for college administrations making the leap into esports is not knowing how many students really want an esports program. This program can include anything from a school funded club all the way to a varsity team that gives scholarships to its players. To address this challenge, I have started a survey that I'm hoping you guys would be willing to take. I'm trying to get this survey to as many schools as possible. 

If you'd like to take it, follow the link below and you'll have the option to sign up to take the survey and also an option to get the results as well. The survey will be emailed out a couple weeks from now.

For those of you that don’t know, FSAE is a world wide competition to build and then compete with your very own formula car. A few years back, the “Highlander” FSAE team switched from IC (internal combustion) to EV (electric vehicle) which to be honest really doesn’t appeal to me at all. 

Therefore, I’m curious to know a few things:
- would anyone be interested
- how would I go about funding this organization, especially considering there already is one.
- should I even bother?

I’m big into cars myself, and have a lot of experience as far as mechanical and electrical engineering go. I’d really like to learn more and do more with internal combustion building and development. I’d also love to meet and learn with others, a lot of my friends at other schools are doing this now and while I can work with him to an extent (he lives in NY rn) I want to bring this opportunity to those here as well. 

To be all clear, this is in no way to compete against the current highlander racing team, this is just a separate team from them focusing on something completely different."

My name is Sam and I'm part of the Student Voice Committee. I go around campus surveying people about a topic we are assigned by our committee leaders. American Sign Language (ASL) was this week's topic. I think it's also next week's too. Anyway, I have a few to things to say and a few questions for you:

Things to say: The HUB is definitely the biggest hotspot for people to survey. People go there to eat, study, chill, chat, etc. We tend to survey those that do not look very academically busy, are in a small group of people, or make eye contact with us. This is my criteria tho. So if you are in the HUB and happen to see a few people with clipboards walking around asking people if they want to take a survey that's probably us. Dont be afraid to say no if you dont have time or dont want to have human contact. Also, thanks to those that helped out with the survey today at the HUB between 2 pm - 4:30 pm :)

Questions for you (These are not official survey questions, but I will bring these up next time the committee meets):

\- Did you know about SVC (Student Voice) prior to this post? 

\- What surveys would you like us to conduct in the future?

\- When we set up a table next to the Bell Tower, what would you like to see? Surveys, UCR swag, other things? 

\- When we post on the subreddit, should what type of information do you want to see? 

\- Any other questions, comments, memes to share? I'd appreciate the memes.

Other things: We have an instagram page if you wanna follow it. Thats where you can find more updates about what we are doing. I think that we are planning on doing a raffle or something like that in the near future. That's it.

im planning to take math9a, chem1a w/ lab, cs11, hist10, &amp; etst1  -- would adding a sixth class be too much? im taking 19 units now (5 classes), and its not too bad (projected 3.9~4.0)

if it seems impossible, then i have no problem taking it over the summer :)

I was in CHASS and I was interested in switching my major to one in CNAS, but I was denied. This was in my freshman year. The reason for this was because I ""wasn't good at science"", which is a direct quote from the CNAS advisor. I had taken one science class at that time. I then asked if I can switch my major to Neuroscience (a CHASS major) and got denied again because I apparently ""wasn't allowed to take calculus"". I'm not exaggerating this conversation, I remember it quite well because this is where my dreams were crushed. The CNAS advisor told me to ""graduate in CHASS and give up on science"". I then brought up doing a second BS degree after graduating, and this advisor straight up told me to just ""give up on science forever, you're just not good enough"". 

I know people that made the switch from CHASS to CNAS but it was in their first quarter. It looks like switching after that becomes impossible. I tried looking for policies that show this in writing, but couldn't find any. [As for math courses, I tested into Math 4. There doesn't seem to be any way to take precalculus and then Math 9A after that though.](https://mathdept.ucr.edu/programs/progressionchart.html) 

It seems to me like they're actively trying to prevent CHASS students from going into CNAS. Why is that? I've seen this in some other schools too. 

I ended up accepting my fate and just graduated with a CHASS degree that I didn't really want. I seriously considered dropping out and taking these science courses at a community college to transfer to another school, which is what I should have done. But my parents said no, and they had my finances in a vice, so I didn't really have a choice in that matter. I went to community college right after graduation and took classes while working, and I'm starting a second bachelor's degree in another state pretty soon. But I wasted a ton of time and money because of some policy that may or may not have existed, and I never got closure on whether I got lied to or not. I suppose it doesn't really matter now but I think I'd like to know for sure."

It’s about a 45 minute drive and can be a lot longer with heavy traffic. I hate the drive and it makes me want to stay home some days.

I decided to commute to stay close to my family and have better work opportunities but I feel like I’m lacking involvement on campus and I don’t want to let this time in my life slip away. I don’t really have many friends from UCR and I feel like the only way to really get involved is to be a lot closer to campus. 

All I do is show up for my classes and go home. 

So my question to you is is it worth it to move to a campus apartment next year? It would be a huge change for me but I’m kind of tired of the commuter life. 

What are some pros and cons I guess"

Was wondering if it was possible for me to leave my stuff in my dorm for a day and come back for it when I actually leave to go home. 

Also, I technically paid for the month of December. I’m not going to be here for a good chunk of the month. Is UCR gonna be greedy and keep the money or us this institution going to give me money back?

I’m a winter transfer and I’ve been having trouble getting ready for school.

I submitted a SHIP waiver to waive insurance since my family is under Medi-cal, but this morning they emailed me telling me I need an insurance carrier document stating my primary care physician’s name and address. As far as I know, my family has never received anything that states a PCP’s name/address; we just have our Benefits ID cards, which don’t state our PCP’s details on them.

I’m assuming that they want my PCP’s details because they want to make sure I meet the 50 mile restriction (my PCP is 48 miles away), but I’m not sure how to get them this information. Could I just have my PCP write up a document including their name and address?

I also noticed in my finaid award a “USHIP Fee Grant.” I’ve read on other posts that when people waived SHIP they had their grants deducted. I don’t mind having my grants deducted since I was planning on waiving insurance anyways. If I don’t end up waiving insurance, will the grant cover it? I’d just like to not have to pay anything more than I need to.

If anyone could help answer my questions, thanks!"

Apparently they have contracted with a couple of marketing companies who are doing the work. 

Not sure why we need a new logo - we have 15-foot high letters at the Hub the current logo. Wonder how much they are spending on this, how much it will cost to change signs, forms, business cards. Seems like another waste of money when you think of all the things across campus that actually need to be fixed. Classroom falling apart? Too bad, but here's a new logo!"

A lot of people are unaware that work study is quite flexible. Meaning if you run out of your award you can request for more and you CAN ALWAYS ask to have your hourly wage raise by any employer that is hiring you under work study. 

TIP: Always ask towards the end of the conversation or if you are asked if you have any concerns/questions. Just say, “ I was wondering if the hourly wage is negotiable?” It ALWAYS is because it’s works study by the way. 💯 

I managed to double my hourly pay and financial aid could not believe it they had me go back to the employer and have them put it in writing the reason why I was gonna be paid that amount and my reason which was a real one was because the job was on the other side of Riverside and I was concerned about most of my money being spent on fuel which actually never happened."

Burger King 
2167 University Ave
Riverside, CA  92507
United States

My friend and I were almost kidnapped.

PLEASE DO NOT TRUST OTHER WOMEN COMING UP TO YOU.

Today at around 7.30pm a woman ran out of the Burger King behind us as we were leaving and started screaming ""DO YOU HAVE JOBS"" as we were getting in the car. She was not looking at us, just looking around us wildly as though she was looking for someone and she ran to the driver's door. I was on the phone with my mom and this woman startled me and I dropped my sauce. She ran around the car door and tried to pick up my sauce as I was going to pick it up. I told her ""I'm on the phone with my Mom"" and jumped in the car and slammed the door shut. My friend jumped in the passenger seat and we locked the doors thinking she was just a nut job. 

That was until we drove into the highway and my tire blew. I drove to the closest gas station and called a tow truck. 

Then we both started piecing the situation together. As we walked in there was a man who asked us to buy him food, but thinking back he didn't look homeless and was actually very well dressed. There was also another man inside the burger king who was watching us the entire time we ate. This woman was also with another woman and they both ran inside as we went to leave and pretended like they were going to order. The one that approached us ran out very fast as soon as we opened the car doors. We were parked right in front of the entrance.

This woman clearly tried to distract us and lure us away from the car or keep us out of the car. Maybe they tried to slash the tire completely so we wouldn't leave or maybe for it to burst as we left. 

Either way we were both very nearly kidnapped today and I am writing this post for all to be aware of what has happened. Be extremely careful and just because you park close to an entrance doesn't mean you're safe. Do not walk around on the phone or distracted. Be very aware of your surroundings. This was clearly planned and more than one or two people were involved. Never pull over on a road or side road if this happens. Pull into a gas station and keep your doors locked while you call a tow truck.

So I checked RWeb today and shit myself, I got a 1.44 this quarter (B-, C, and an F).  My academic standing says ""Subject to Disqualification"", is this the same as Academic Probation? I don't know if below 1.50 is a different shitshow than just between 1.50 and 2.0. I've never had &lt; 2.0 before, so I have no idea how this works. 

Basically, I'm confused between ""Subject to Disqualification"", ""Subject to Dismissal"", and if ""Academic Probation"" is a another standing category. Not sure if I get to redeem my GPA next quarter or just get kicked out right away. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone in BCOE (idk if policy differs) been in the same situation? Emailed my advisor but they're switching around or something atm, so I doubt I'll hear back soon.

Hope yall did better than me this quarter, happy holidays"

i was going through it this quarter and i want to submit an appeal for academic dismissal  
ucr says i have to submit the following: 
1). Documentation of extenuating circumstances (such as a death certificate, notes from a doctor, etc.)
2). Documentation from your faculty that you were in good standing in your courses when an unforeseen circumstance occurred.
3). Documentation from your faculty that you did not take the finals in your courses.
4). Documentation from your academic adviser about whether you discussed these circumstances with him/her during the quarter.
5). An explanation, which you can provide in your written statement, of why you did not withdraw from the quarter.

the only thing i would not be able to submit is #3, because i took all of my finals. would this lessen the chance of my appeal being accepted? 
i also need to ""list grades to be changed"" with an attached note from my professor. what would i say in my e-mail to her?
if anyone who has experienced this and has had their appeal accepted has advice/suggestions, it would greatly be appreciated!

I'm trying to transfer in Fall 2020 to UCR as a stats major (so I have to fill the application really soon!)

I'm gonna have to try to convince my parents that I really want to come home since they felt that UW was a good investment, but I don't really see it that way and I don't want to be in a lot of debt.

I have no friends and I have never had interest in making friends. I lost all my friends last year because I am a cesspool of rage and idiocy. I waste so much of my free time acting like a broken piece of shit.

The only reason I have grades is because I have intelligence to fill in the massive void left by my soul.

And I honestly despise myself for the shit that happened last quarter. Last year. The last 20 years. I know exactly what I did. I relive the moments over and over again in my head because I honestly can’t wait for the day God takes me to Hell.

I’m washed up. I’m cancelled. I’m messed up on another plane of existence.

I’m not going to withdraw because I don’t believe in inflicting intentional harm through any means, future-affecting or otherwise. I’m absolutely not interested in death. But I’ve decided that my presence should be considered wholly harmful.

I’ve wasted 2 years trying to fix myself. It’s not working enough.

If you’re fully willing to report me to Student Conduct for my sins so that I can be dismissed, please send me a private message for details. Otherwise, shut up.

After that, I plan to go to a psych ward... or prison... for the rest of my life.

**Dennis McIver** - Counselor, University Honors, VP of UCR Staff Assembly, Chair, Black Faculty and Staff Association

This is my first year as a transfer psych major. One of my professors today was asking a question on how we interpreted one of the readings. Normally I’m very shy but today for once I decided to raise my hand and try to answer since I felt confident in the passage we read. She already seemed annoyed with calling on me and when I answered she was like “ummm... yeah I don’t really think that makes sense.” And then jumped to someone else. It was so embarrassing and I wanted to cry. She was nice to the other 10-15 people who answered questions, and one guy even answered the same question very similar to the way I did and she was nice and encouraged his answer. 

I literally have no idea what I did wrong. This is the first time I’ve ever spoken in lecture and have never encountered her outside of class or anything. I always show up on time and do all my work and have been respectful. I was taken aback by how she responded to me since she had been so nice to everyone else, even if their answers weren’t really relevant. I know I’m not the smartest but for the first time I tried really hard to be involved just to get shut down like that. It was embarrassing and awkward and made me feel like a complete idiot.

Honestly, MOOD.  
I know a lot of UCR students are in the process of looking for internships/post-grad work but are too stressed and busy to even start the job search process. 

RippleMatch is a platform that does the work for you; you take 5-10 minutes to upload your resume and set your preferences, and then you start getting matched with first-round interviews at companies like Gap, IBM, Dell, Pfizer, and many more.

More than 60% of matches result in a first-round interview, so help me help you and sign up  [here](https://ripplematch.com/index?r=DXXRs2)!

I personally have been matched with PNC, Tapestry (Kate Spade and Coach's parent company), and Estee Lauder, so I believe that this platform could really help! Of course, it definitely does not replace regular job-searching and applying, but it’s a nice side tool and helps ease the process a little :)"

My favorite spots to work and study at are all in the Humanities building in the second and third floor. There’s a ton of little lounge areas. 

Ever since my first year I’ve been going to the Humanities building almost daily to wait out gaps or whatever.

Guaranteed at least once a week, someone stops and asks me where to find Room X. I only know where to find my study areas and that’s it, so I feel bad when I have to say “Sorry don’t know” on a weekly basis. 

The humanities building is fairly high traffic and there’s always a rotation of students who are new to the building as they find their professors office hours in there or whatever. 

The classrooms.ucr.edu website is no help. All it has is the first floor rooms which honestly are the easiest to find. 

We really need a better online resource. I know there’s a map outside of humanities but it’s not enough it seems. 

Humanities is laid out pretty badly, a lot of people get confused and walk around in circles. It’s not very intuitive. I used to think it was just me but I’ve seen first hand so many people get lost."

Why is it that we have to be harassed on our way to class by people trying to get us to sign stuff? First they innocently ask if we are registered to vote and then they ask us to sign some petition we know nothing about. The people trying to sell the signature are usually way too pushy, calling out individuals based on appearance. I feel bad for the people who get suckered in to a five minute ordeal because they were too kind to say no to one of the ""salespeople"". One is enough. I shouldn't have to turn down three within 25 ft of walking.

 If I'm trying to get to class on time I already don't want to sign anything. But this kind of predatory peer pressure that tries to lure people into signing something they know nothing about is harassment. This should not be tolerated on campus and if you want me to sign something, I'd sign a petition limiting the amount of these set up at one time."

However after using the app myself, I found that the frontend design is very unattractive and makes it really hard to schedule/enter availabilities on mobile.

I created a new version of when2meet called Vailable ([vailable.io](https://vailable.io/)) that keeps the best parts of when2meet but has a cleaner frontend and more functions. It's totally free and allows you to view people’s availabilities to choose the best meeting time. I've already migrated a lot of Yale students to the platform and it has been working great so far. I’m excited to see how it helps student orgs at UCR!

If any of you have any suggestions or features that you would like to see implemented. Please let me know!

I am now graduating in fall 2020. I've been applying for summer 2020 internship positions, and have gotten minimal feedback. I'm very tired of school at this point.
I'm tired of doing homework every week. I'm tired of attending lectures. I'm tired of making sure my assignments ensure I get the points I need. I'm tired of walking around campus. I'm tired of the job application process. I'm tired of trying to market myself at job fairs. I'm tired of collaborating with peers. I'm tired of exams and finals. I'm tired of 10 week schedules. 
Most importantly, I'm tired of not having any money. I tried working while going to school last year, and it was hard as hell. I got decent grades, but man was it tough. I now have no job so I can have an easier time. Not having money is making me go crazy. I need some employer to give me a chance, so I can show what I am capable of. I'm a CS major, so I'm afraid of messing up a coding interview and them thinking I'm trash because I was under pressure. Like, why can't I just find a job super easy?

ewkxxg,A Potential Transfer Student Curious About Leniency of the Bournes College of Engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/ewkxxg/a_potential_transfer_student_curious_about/,PercivleOnReddit,1,2020-01-30 23:41:50,1,/r/ucr/comments/ewkxxg/a_potential_transfer_student_curious_about/,Question,"So I am currently a student at community college and am hoping to be admitted into UCR and transfer there this fall to continue my studies of mechanical engineering at the Bourns College of Engineering. In my most recent semester, during the Fall of 2019, I had a pretty rough time doing well in my classes ( one of the Physics courses, Differential Equations, and Calc 3). And while I did manage to pass them all, I only managed to pass Calculus 3 with a C grade.

Now personally I am not too phased by this. I don’t always do stellar work in math classes and usually master the concepts after the fact when I’ve had more practice applying them in subsequent classes. However, I am aware that the minimum requirements for transfer into the Bourns College of Engineering specifically states a minimum overall GPA of 2.5 in the Calculus series. With this most recent C in Calculus 3, my GPA in that series comes to be a 2.3 overall. So this has left me with one question that I’m hoping some of you can help me answer.

Do you know how strict or lenient those who handle transfer admissions are with applicants who fall just short of minimum requirements? It may be worth noting that I have earned two A grades out of the three calculus-based Physics courses, meaning I’m on track to meet all other minimum GPA requirements. Additionally I have TAGged UCR for transfer, so it would be pretty disappointing to have that one portion of the requirements hold me back.

I'm willing to fill out the paperwork to retake Calc 3 if needed and know of one or two teachers who would probably add me in if I asked nicely enough. But I'm reluctant to add another course to my load, and subsequently add hw, when in the face of my final two courses for the upcoming spring session (Electromagnetism and Linear Algebra) which are both supposed to be pretty challenging; though I'm eager to learn about E&amp;M and am not too worried about Linear Algebra. Nor am I worried that I can't pass Calc 3 again and do better. It's all about that Calc series GPA. Any insight you could give would be much appreciated!"

How do we achieve that if our mind only thinks of the same routine that we know of and doesn't know what is possible without interacting much with others? Being more social also boosts our confidence because we get to practice our communicate skills which is extremely important in almost any career field. If you think that you were born a low self-esteem kid who just naturally anti social then you should be open to learn a new fact. It is a practice thing that you can get better if you want to. All you need to do is get out of your comfort zone and push yourself which you will have to eventually no matter how much  you tell yourself otherwise. So why not now? Save time and start investing in your soft skills. 

I'm sure you heard of this. The strongest people don't just feel happy, they train their mentality to be strong by accepting negative emotions and learn how to move beyond. Yes this is all from learning the best suitable things to improve yourself and unlearning the toxicity, nothing's magical. You will be much happier, more positive, and stronger when challenges come to kick your ass which it is a part of life. You just can't hide or run away from problems forever. If you said then life is crappy, you don't want to face it, then know this, there is 1:400,000,000,000 chance that you were being born. You are not mediocre, you are fucking awesome and amazing to fight through and successfully be here today. Let that sink in. 

Imagine when you can use your unique skills that you learn today to help and give back to others? I don't know about you but when I was anti social and hated human interaction, I was obsessed with Amazon prime. I thought buying things could make me happy, but sadly it couldn't last, in fact it's a short term satisfying feeling. Then one day when I decided to go volunteer, simply just street clean up with many others who care about our community and environment in Riverside, my heart just felt so warm and happy that I still feel it today even after one year. It makes me want to do more. It's all start with small actions and train yourself to enjoy the process, accomplishments will come eventually.

Everyone will reach their prime time and get what they want with the right amount of commitment. Because of scarcity, this world doesn't have enough to provide for everyone who wants the same thing at the same time. That's why you need to stop comparing yourself to others like your cousins or friends even when your parents do so. Start focusing on you and your journey. 

If you still can't avoid the feeling of comparing yourself to other people because you grew up that way (that's me), think about it this way: If someone is better than you at something, it's likely that they have failed at it more than you have. If someone is worse than you at something, it's likely that they haven't been through all the painful experience that you have. This perspective helps you control and reduce the size of your ego, become more humble and confident at the same time which you might see it in a lot of successful powerful people. We will also stop blaming external environments for our failure and start take charge internally. Can you blame the ocean that is too large that you get lost and don't know where to go? 

Great attitude and communication skills will bring you to a whole new level financially, physically and mentally.

The message is kinda long but my point is I hope you can give yourself a chance to explore by being more social. I love cooking for others and learn that as a shy introvert, I can help connect people too. So I tried to put this picnic together to help anyone who feel lonely and isolated on the campus have a better chance at taking the first step and getting out of their comfort zone. The first step is difficult but so so important. Believe that I was in your shoes for years, desperately, still am but getting better. I'm willing to spend my time to cook and provide the food at zero cost for attendees on this picnic because I'm happy doing this. 

Consider to join us. We are a chill group, anyone is welcome. If you are interested, join us on GroupMe. DM me for the link because there many too many spams here on Reddit. Thank you for reading my TED talk.

Yes the masks that most of the people are wearing right now are ineffective against aerosol transmissible diseases. However, the recent Wuhan Coronavirus, as far as I'm concerned, is known to likely be droplet transmission. In this case, surgical masks are absolutely fine.

In the case that the coronavirus was aerosol transmissible, the N95 Respirators that some people wear are tested and certified against particles that are approximately 0.3 microns in size.
[](http://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/323208O/n95-particulate-respirators-1860-1860s-1870-faqs.pdf)

While the N95 Respirators are more effective than regular surgical masks for airborne diseases, for droplet based diseases, you will find that the two are relatively similar, so there's also no need to go out of your way to find N95 masks.

[](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2749214) 
that compare the two types of masks.
&gt;In this pragmatic, cluster randomized clinical trial involving 2862 health care personnel, there was no significant difference in the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza among health care personnel with the use of N95 respirators (8.2%) vs medical masks (7.2%).

Practicing good hygiene is probably more important in keeping yourself safe, and wearing masks can also stop you from habitually touching your face with your hands.

TLDR: It's perfectly fine and good practice to wear masks. Don't let people like the OP basing his entire knowledge off of one news article and calling you dumb stop you from wearing them."

I'm a female freshman living in Pentland Hills. Last night, my suitemates had their friends over when I went to the restroom. In the middle of me being on the toilet, I see the door slowly slide open, stopping about a foot wide, and it stays like that for 3-5 seconds. I overcome my shock and get up to quickly pull up my shorts, but I hear the guy say ""oh, sorry 'bout that,"" and slide the door mostly closed, leaving about a 2 cm gap still open. I realize he probably saw.. everything.. based on where he was most likely standing and when I went to that angle to see what the mirror would be reflecting, it showed everything.... I don't really know what to do or how to feel. It has been about 11 hours since then. At first I was really angry, because who would open a closed door and think it was unoccupied? And then I felt really embarrassed and violated... in a way. But then I started questioning if I had a the right to feel that way and if I was/am overreacting. I'm just so confused and I don't know what to do. Should I tell my RA? Should I just forget about it and move on?

Worst one is third flood HUB, slow, in convenient and sometimes warm 

SRC has good flow bottle refill stations but it tastes a bit weird 

Speed of the fountain at Riviera &lt; Orbach 

Humanities has 7 floors ( from the history department entrance) 

Slowest elevator on campus is at Skye Hall 

Second slowest is the HUB ( more so during lunch rush) 

Pierce Hall elevator jerks more on the way down than the way up

If you keep a constant pace it takes approx. 10 minutes from ULH to Spieth Hall

The director’s garden near lot 3 is the only place on campus with a pond AND fish 

You can find large lavender bushes(?) near Watkins in the spice garden, on the side of Chemical Sciences facing the botanical garden, the botanical garden, and near the Fawcett laboratory 

.99 for any pop tart at any store on campus, .49 at the bookstore if they’re on clearance 

Closest microwave to Orbach is the scotty’s near the SOM 

Closest microwave to Riviera is HUB or the Habit 

Almost all sodas on campus are $2 but at Scotty’s you pay slightly more but have more variety 

2/$5 rockstar deal at scotty’s 

You cannot redeem Starbucks stars at the Glenmore Starbucks 

10 pages free printing per day at any of the student program rooms on campus 

All libraries check out chargers for all types of phones 

There’s an infrequently used elevator in Orbach 

The Entomology building has live specimens on the first floor ( really cool!)

Taxidermy Museum on the second floor of Spieth Hall

Various geological/paleontological exhibits in the geology building 

There are small study niches in most of the halls/buildings 

A brisk walk from the SRC to lothian and roughly 10 minutes ( might have changed with construction)"

This may be of interest to some UCR students and/or alum:

The Department of Psychological Science at the University of California, Irvine is currently accepting applications to our post-baccalaureate program in psychological science (the deadline to apply for Fall 2020 is May 22nd). 

**Program** **Overview:**  UCI’s Post-Baccalaureate Program in Psychological Science is a certificate program that combines psychology coursework with research and/or internship experience. It is designed for people who have a bachelor’s degree (in any discipline); who are interested in a psychology-related graduate program, career development, or career change; and who could benefit from additional coursework, research and/or real-life work experience in psychology. Those interested in doctoral-level or master’s degree programs in a range of areas of psychology (including clinical/counseling psychology, social/personality psychology, developmental psychology, health psychology, psychology &amp; the law, and school psychology) or health (e.g., public health, medical school) can strengthen their graduate school applications by completing our program, which offers an individualized course of study based on each person’s qualifications and goals.  Students who have completed our program have been accepted to a wide variety of graduate programs, including Ph.D. programs at UC Berkeley, Cornell University, and UC Irvine; Psy.D. programs at Cal Lutheran, University of Indianapolis, and Yeshiva University, and Master's programs at NYU, Columbia, and UCLA.

**Program** **Description:**  The program consists of eight courses, which may include lower- and upper-division lectures, small seminars (including advanced statistics and research methods), hands-on research lab courses, and/or hands-on internship courses.  The program can be completed at the student’s own pace, in as little as 9 months or in as many as 24 months, depending upon one’s schedule and preferences.  A faculty advisor will work closely with students to help plan courses and provide guidance on obtaining letters of recommendation, choosing graduate programs, writing personal statements, and applying for jobs.  In addition, students will have the opportunity to attend our weekly departmental colloquia and other special events and to interact with our community of faculty, researchers, and graduate students.  For more information, please visit: [https://ps.soceco.uci.edu/post-bacc-page/post-baccalaureate-program-psychological-science](https://ps.soceco.uci.edu/post-bacc-page/post-baccalaureate-program-psychological-science)

**Information** **Session:**  An information session will be held on Friday, February 21st at 11am in Social Ecology I (SE-I) Room 112 on the UC Irvine campus ([http://uci.edu/visit/maps.php](http://uci.edu/visit/maps.php)).  All are welcome!"

is it actually worth the time to join it socially and academically, or am i better off not trying at all?"

 LINK HERE: [**https://ripplematch.com/index?r=DXXRs2**](https://ripplematch.com/index?r=DXXRs2) 

If you get a match and accept, you have a 70% chance to getting through to the interview round because the algorithm matches you to companies that would most likely be  interested in you.

I think it's pretty cool because it's free and it takes about 5 minutes to apply -- just need to upload your resume and set job preferences. Then the cool stuff starts happening! 

I would suggest signing up now because it's the peak of recruitment season and companies are looking to hire for summer right now! I've already matched with companies like Estee Lauder, PNC, Baker Hughes, and XPO Logistics, etc. And my friends have already gotten internships at places like Dell and Pfizer!

As  a UCR student as well, I know how hard the job search is and I really hope this tool helps you like it helps me. 

Don't forget to keep your head up if you don't pass the interview round or don't get the matches you want. Keep on trying, and remember that rejections hurt, but everyone has to go through them to improve.

Happy job hunting!! 

If you have any questions about RippleMatch, the job search, or professional development, pls feel free to ask."

I have been living in Bannockburn for the past school year. I plan to graduate and complete my courses Fall 2020. This is a bit of a last minute decision as I decided it would be best for me.  I have renewed my lease here at Bannockburn because I would like to stay here for Fall 2020 and also receive the free summer housing. However after reading the contract I am a bit confused about the following: 

**c. (Terms and Eligibility)** 

**The Resident is required to give UCR-HDHS a thirty (30) day prior written notice in the event Resident will cease to be a currently-enrolled student in the next quarter by reason of graduation, termination of student status for not less than one quarter, or transfer to another educational institution. The failure to give such notice shall result in the assessment of 30 days pro rata rent or $75.00, whichever is greater, as a liquidated damages charge to cover UCR-HDHS’ administrative costs.**

So from my understanding, because I will be graduating before the end of the contract, I just need to give a 30-day notice explaining that I am graduating and will not be there for the rest of the school year. 

However, I also saw this under the cancellation policies:

1. **Res**i**dents who renew a Contract effective July 1, 2020, shall retain their Apartment payment-free for July, 2020, and August, 2020,**  
**provided Resident does not cancel the Contract prior to the end of Fall Quarter, 2020.**  

   1. **(a)  Cancellation of a renewed Contract after the Effective Date but prior to the end of Fall Quarter, 2020, will result in full**  
**assessment of rent charges for July, 2020 and August, 2020, as applicable**

Does this mean because Fall 2020 would be my last quarter, I would end up being charged rent for the summer? It says prior to the end of Fall quarter, and I plan to stay the entirety of fall quarter in order to complete my requirements. I'm going to give them a call tomorrow, but was wondering if anyone has gone through this before? Thank you :)"

So I decided to extend my stay at UCR until Fall 2020 (I was supposed to graduate this upcoming spring) for mental health &amp; other personal reasons. The only thing that is concerning me is my financial aid. So far, my tuition and most of my expenses are covered currently with Cal Grant A and my unsub/sub loans. This has been working out fine, but I have been doing some research and some people say after 4 years your cal grant is taken away, which makes up about half of my coverage. I also saw some people saying that UCR Grants would take over, but I am a bit confused about that. 

If it helps, I summed everything up and so far I have a total of 12 quarters (including this winter quarter, and the spring 2020 quarter) which would mean if I do end up attending Fall 2020 then I would have a total of 13 quarters. I have never taken a summer term. In addition, I do plan to graduate by Fall 2020. My parents income increased 2 years ago, so I stopped receiving any UCR or Pell Grants after my sophomore year. 

Should I except a significant decrease in aid (something over $400?) or would it be more or less the same? Anyone with any advice is greatly appreciated!"

I'm a freshman and this is my second time taking English 4. My writing skills are really poor, as in I have trouble with critical thinking, coming up with examples, going in depth, and elaborating. Sometimes I think I did pretty decent, but it ends up not being enough. My friends tell me I just need to ""work harder"" or ""do better,"" and I know this is true. I would like to say that I don't know why it's not working out, but I know it's because I'm not working hard enough. I also know that the solution to this is to just do it. I guess what I'm lacking is the motivation.

Last quarter, I withdrew from English 4 on the 6th week because I felt really distressed by the fact that I wasn't improving, my professor's criticism on my last essay made me feel hopeless (I know, I was being a baby), and I felt like the amount of time I put into doing work for the class wasn't worth my lack of studying for other classes. Overall, I felt like I was destroying myself with my own thoughts. I had a history of depression and cutting a little under 2 years ago, and the fact that I considered self harm again or suicide at the time makes me scared for myself. I know that sounds very dramatic and it was just an English class, but at the time I felt trapped, like nothing was getting better, and I just wanted everything to end.

My parents, my mom especially, had huge expectations for me to go to a UC. Both my siblings are/were academically successful and attend(ed) UCSD and it makes me feel even more pressured to be as academically successful as them. Truthfully, I don't have a desire to go to college. I know that having a degree would mean more chances at getting a high paying job, but I honestly feel fine with having a job that requires a minimum of a high school diploma.

I don't really know where I'm going with this anymore. I don't know what to do. I want to drop out, but I'm scared of being a disappointment to my family. But if I stay, I'm also scared that I might drive myself crazy and do something bad. I considered going to see a therapist but I'm scared to go alone (I have no friends), even though I will probably be alone with the therapist."

\*this goes to anyone this applies to\*

My heart goes out to you on this, so please hear me out. This isn’t fair. I don’t want you or anyone to bear so much pain. Circumstances aren’t the best, but it will get better. There are bigger problems in life than school, so I hope you don’t allow yourself to be consumed by the darkness we all face. You’re not alone...more so than you may ever realize despite your perception of everything around you.

So, this is quite the dilemma for many of us. As discouraging as it is to hear the possibility of hurting yourself or worse, it breaks my heart to see this pattern where it happens to those of us who are alone. You may also struggle with motivation due to your inner feelings and the mind is a terrible enemy to face everyday. Having some kind of motivator, like a pet, helps significantly, otherwise you could seek out a rival, like family member attending another college or someone you meet on campus, or maybe set yourself short-term goals. Goals are a great way to challenge ourselves and overcome obstacles. I would love to go over goals more thoroughly with you.

When taking on a full-time status as a student, we need to prioritize our classes and downtime. Matching certain electives helps alleviate stress from stressful courses, and using campus resources may also help develop skills like writing. 

Use campus resources to get help with writing. One super important thing I want to emphasize is that you should plan out a 4-5 year schedule of classes with flexibility. Gotta be able to switch around for when things happen right? If you have a plan to follow, you’re more likely to succeed with fewer implications. Course load is usually the main factor that brings students fall behind schedule so balance is key. 

For your writing class, and other classes too, I suppose, Working directly on what the professors suggest and showing some improvement is all you really need to get their support to at least pass, if not make you a better writer. Attend office hours often and you will be noticed more, therefore garnering their support. They want you to succeed, unless they are shitty humans then I send my condolences for dealing with that kind of crap in a college setting. Anyway, ask for specific examples of what you need to improve on and do extra work. Write a small piece that focuses on what you need improvement on. It’s a great way to refine your individual aspects in writing, like analysis, reflection, use of ethos/pathos/logos, etc. I know you can improvise little by little, even if it’s 1% everyday. You have plenty of time in a quarter to go from a D to an A, which is best case scenario so, even if you don’t get the A, and you fall short, it will be a passing grade much better than a D.

Depression is a tough cookie, many of us who battle depression can only do so much on our own without support. I speak from experience too. Although my depression can be traced back to childhood, and chronic depression is a monster on its own. The majority of people who have depression develop it from around high school and onward. Things are not like they were before when education wasn’t so expensive and society wasn’t so screwed up. We are a whole new generation or depression attributed to layers and layers of problems that threaten our health. 

Hurting yourself never really resolves anything and is toxic like alcohol or drug abuse, if you can picture yourself all drugged up, it’s not a pretty picture, I’m confident you can picture something just as awful from injuring yourself. 

Life really sucks sometimes, college sucks for sure, besides the social elements, but the payout at the end makes the journey worth it. It’s not so much the end result but the experiences along the way that make it gratifying. 

Suicide should not be the solution to such problems we face. Our problems are temporary, suicide is permanent. It’s absolutely unreasonable to resolve a temporary problem with a permanent solution. If you get what I mean. I know this is a super sensitive subject so I won’t really say more on this. 

College isn’t for everyone, but learning is. Whatever it is you discover to be your passion in life, you can pursue that with or without education. Also, you can find employment that will aid your pursuit of education like certifications, licenses, and credentials, necessary for furthering your career. Having an education conveniently improves your quality of life because it reflects on many aspects of your life and the potential to succeed, however, you can do the same with a plan. If you prepare yourself for a particular career, you can become successful at anything you do.  I had a talk with a family member about dropping out once, and they said they were proud of me regardless and I would always have a home to come back to. Even if it doesn’t work out for you at the college, you still have options elsewhere. Other colleges you can attend. So don’t stress too much. Besides I think CSU is the way to go lol

Even though it’s your first year in college, you’re not alone, thousands of us come in without guidance or support and are learning how to figure things out for ourselves. We’re away from home and learning how to be independent, or taking care of others who need help more than we do. It’s alright not knowing what to do or what you want. Just enjoy the ride as best you can And figure it out one day at a time. Meet with your academic advisers. Talk to your professors during open hours. You have more resources available to you than you may be aware of. We have virtually no reasons to fail besides giving up. It’s easy to give up, but difficult to persevere and move forward. 

The only disappointment there will be is the one you create. Your parents will and should be proud of you for doing your best, they should also be fine with you realizing college may not be for you because then you can focus on something greater. There are other ways to manage life. You have more time to finish school later. Maybe take on community college for a couple years, or take online classes. Or maybe work for a while and then go back to school, although it’s probably easier to handle school now as opposed to later\* what I’m saying is, don’t worry about it too much because all your parents really want for you is to be happy and healthy. I’m sure they have told you before, “we just want what’s best for you” “we just want you to be happy” right? Sometimes they just don’t know that something might be best for you that contradicts what they think, but behind that they still want what’s best for you, so if you say college isn’t the best for me right now, they shouldn’t have any problem with it. Things work out on their own, with active effort\* also if you were miserable doing some boring job, I’m sure they would rather see you happy working a job that better suits you. So don’t be confused too much by my examples sorry.  No matter what, as long as you don’t feel like a disappointment, and you do what’s best for you, you’ll be fine. 

If you’re concerned that something bad may happen, I think what would really help is having a close friend. Maybe reaching out to someone and connecting on a certain level will help clear your mind. Having someone to go through college with makes all the difference in the world. Some students prefer being alone or do better alone but it doesn’t usually hurt to have someone with you when you’re both focused and have goals. A large group might goof off but a small group should manage just fine.

A therapist might help or it might be a waste of time. You yourself may already be aware of what the answer is for what you actually need to get through all this. Not just a friend, but someone you can count on. Supporting each other is better than one person being supported because if the supportive person needs support, it gets tricky. So try to be there for each other. Not having friends sucks. I can relate. But that’s because I rather have a select few close friends than many superficial friends. I don’t have time for fake, wasteful meaningless interactions with non like-minded people. If you want to be a part of my life, show interest in me and my well being and then, and only then, will I allow myself to invest in you as a friend. If you take care of others, eventually they may be able to take care of you in your time of need so, it is nice to have others you can rely on. So, please be patient, I have confidence you’ll find at least one individual willing to join you and take on the world. College is a small place, you’ll find someone soon enough : )

Here’s one final thing I’d like to say...from here on out, the very minimum effort you need to give life is 100%. You need to do give 100% every day all the time basically for the rest of your life or else you cut yourself short. It sucks really, but that’s how it is and when you realize this, you’ll feel tired, like all the time, but at least you sleep better, you feel better, and you live better. Almost everything you do will be better when you don’t settle for less than 100%. Having higher standards for yourself will only set you up for success in life. And I believe each and every single one of us can make it in this shitty world we all share. The world isn’t shitty, it’s the people. Because if you look around, You can see all the ones who gave up, again which is easy to do, and you’ll see the kind of standards they accepted. We set our own Living standards, and it sucks to see people we know and care about living difficult lives, and some of that is due to the fact that we only have so much control over our lives. Once we give up, everything becomes so much harder, and it’s is difficult climbing out of that whole, like financial debt, and more likely than not, things will become worse and we are forced to accept it and live with our decisions. So I urge everyone here to Not give up. I mean yeah you could drop out of here, or transfer, or take a break and return, there’s a process for that. So long as you’re not completely giving up. You can always return and finish your education later, whether it’s in a few months or a year or a few years, but that’s for you to decide. Ultimately, what I mean to say, is don’t give up on yourself or on life. You will be just fine, if not better than fine. I know you’ll make it!

This is a message for those of you who are alone or feel like you don’t have anyone. Whether you’re struggling mentally/emotionally, physical, educationally, financially, or any kind problem, there is someone who wants to help. I am extremely confident there is at least one person who is there for you, or wants to be there for you. Maybe things are weird between you, or something, whatever, the point is, there is someone you can reach out to whom would be happy to help, who would not hesitate, and maybe wants to reach out to you but can’t for particular reasons. We all have at least one person there, it just sucks if we are not aware and don’t know it. So if you really are feeling like this is the worst, but you haven’t yet reached out to anyone or someone you know who’s willing to help you, you haven’t exhausted all your options and can’t truly be upset with everything. Seriously, this isn’t the time to be stubborn or prideful or whatever the sentiment is. Don’t deprive yourself of what you need or could use to better yourself. You need to take care of yourself and sometimes allow others, or someone else, to take care of you. If they want to, why refuse? Maybe it’s a good thing, and good things in life are hard to come by for most of us, so, don’t hold yourself back from anything in life. With or without support, you can do anything you want. It’s just nicer to have a friend or someone there for you. To have that extra support. I believe in all of you. So again, I say, Don’t Give Up!"

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Could you help us understand how emotions buffer people against stress experienced by immigrants?  


To participate in this study, you need to be 

1.       International students or second-generation immigrant and

2.       In college or graduate school

You will only take some short online surveys (25 minutes long). We don't collect any information on immigration status or physical address. 1 in 5 participants will win a $25 Amazon gift card. We also got IRB approval. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**This research can help identify more protective factors for immigrants with fewer resources.**  **Further , this study hopes to contribute to reducing health disparities in immigrant families.**  If you are willing to help, please reach me by direct message.

Thank you!"

Kind of a random question here, but I’d really appreciate it if anyone could help answer this lol. A very quick bit of explanation first:

So recently I’ve gotten super into building and modifying vintage style synthesizers, and by extension the whole DIY and “maker” scenes (whichever term you prefer). Lately I’ve been really keen on building my own cases/enclosures for the keyboards I build and after some looking online the best solutions seem to be things like laser cutting, CNC, 3D printing, etc. These machines are pretty damn expensive, so I started looking for maker spaces in my area that allow average people access to these kinda tools.

So after a quick google search, the only makerspace remotely close to where I live (Riverside) seems to be the UCR Creat’R lab, but their website is pretty vague on whether it’s open to the public or strictly for students. Same thing with their 3D printing program. There’s a form on the website where you can submit a CAD design and have it printed on location for a small fee, but it doesn’t really say if you have to be a UCR student to submit stuff.

Is anyone here familiar with the space, and know if they allow the general public to attend? I’m just wondering if maybe they have a day or time allotted for non-students, or if it’s just kind of an open space where people come and go? I know programs on campus are open to the public because I’ve been to a couple things at UCR before, but I can’t seem to find much info.

And if it’s strictly for students, I’d like to avoid the awkwardness of randomly showing up and being asked what in the hell i’m doing there lol.

Anyway, thanks in advance for any replies guys"

And walking the other way I noticed it said ""THINGS CHANGE."" I thought again, ""this is a neat installation! not only does it remind you that we can change things, but that we need to be aware that things change and we need to adapt to those changes."" It was a nice little art piece, a sign with a fairly clever message that wasn't too flashy but still got a walker-by's eye. 

Flash forward a few days and I find a disgusting conglomeration of yellow all over the front of the art building. The words ""CHANGE"" and ""THINGS"" fill my view in no reasonable order in a tasteless attempt to seem ""cute"" and ""trendy"" by plastering the words 'change' and 'things' everywhere. The stark contrast between the art building's muted color scheme and the onslaught of yellow directly outside of it attacks the eye. 

It was so much better when they just had the singular sign. It wasn't too obvious, the message got across to students, and it wasn't overwhelming. Complete waste of a million dollars."
