I'm in the process of applying to Berkeley's *many* consulting clubs. My career advisor said getting into one of these clubs would be a great step towards my career goals. But I also don't want to animorph into a snake if possible :)

* Since many club information sessions and case workshops overlap, I was wondering if it's better to try to dip my toe in different clubs and build contact with one person at each or.....should I just focus on the three clubs I really like and try to attend all their events?
* Do they keep track of participation at info sessions and workshops? Would bigger clubs like BC and TBG even care about participation?
* Should I apply to as many consulting clubs I can to increase my chances of getting into one? I've heard they're all insanely competitive and you can't even target down a smaller one.
* Finally, do you guys know any cool smaller Berkeley organizations looking for business help?

I really like Net Impact, BEACN, and VSS because they work with smaller organizations and seem like generally good people. I'm a normal Econ/Pre-Haas kid that hasn't skipped out of many classes but has a lot of strong experiences, projects, and internships. If anyone here has made it into strategy consulting I'd love to hear your story.

I really appreciate all your help and advice!"

I know that many of the upper div classes for Data Science overlap with the upper div requirements for Computer Science.

Earlier this summer I made a post about not getting into Math 1B this semester. I didn’t receive a 5 on the BC exam, so I couldn’t test out of it. However, I understand the material or BC quite thoroughly and am pretty confident that I didn’t score as well as I’d hoped because of senioritis (not an excuse, ik, but bear with me).

Upon further inquiry into the course, it appears that the content of 1B (and 1A, for that matter) are scarcely used in 54, only in the last four weeks of the course when differential equations are covered. However, Math 1B is technically a prerequisite for Math 54.

My question to you all: my adviser says that the Math department may or may not catch the fact that I have not met the prerequisites yet. I’d hate to drop out of Math 54, as I’ve already thoroughly studied the first two modules and submitted the first hw assignment (but mainly, though, I’m interested in the new course material and not repeating what I’ve already learned). I know I have to take 1B eventually, and I was planning on  taking it second semester, but I want some advice on whether to keep 54.

If, hypothetically, they catch the fluke mid-semester after the add/drop period and I’m kicked from 54, I’d be falling below the 13 unit minimum. Any advice?"

This is definitely not meant to be a comprehensive guide that will guarantee your acceptance into any business club but more of a FAQ with a few personal insights: I remember how stressed I was as a first-year about getting into one of these clubs and there was even a semester where I applied to 9+ clubs and was rejected from every single one of them. I'm a current business student, and I've met plenty of people who aren't in any prestigious clubs, so it's far from the end of the world if you don't find a business community to be a part of. Some things about me to qualify my perspective: I'm in a ""top-tier"" or ""upper-tier"" business organization and have worked on projects with well-known firms, and I've also been a part of a ""mid-tier"" organization in the past.

**(1) Be yourself (or be someone I want to hang out with)**: Business clubs in particular are a balance between a professional and social organization. Working on projects, you'll spend countless hours with other members of the organization; because of this, clubs generally screen not only for how intelligent applicants are but also for how sociable you are and how much you fit with members of the organization. You'll end up spending a lot of time with the people in the business club and so we want to make sure that you're someone we would want to spend a lot of time with. That's why so many clubs tend to have a close-knit feel and why many end up being good friends outside the club. \[That's not to say that clubs will reject very qualified applicants for someone who is a good social fit: But for the average applicant, being a good social fit will do much more for you than being ""smart.""\]

**(2) Network** ***a lot*****!** Come out to the organization's events and meet as many people in the organization as you can: Follow-up by dropping by tabling and saying hi. If you're a great social fit and click with many of our members, that will help you incredibly in the application process: While recruiting I hear dozens of students talk about their interest in business, which is awesome, but I'm also interested in hearing more about you as a person, from everything you like to do for to your thoughts on the latest GOT season, etc. Most clubs do track interest so even just going out to an event will give you a leg-up. Nothing stands out more (at least to me) than someone who doesn't come out to any event or talk to any member of our club but applies for an interview and expects to get in. That said, avoid being overbearing, and always be the best version of yourself. The general idea is show your interest, connect with us, but don't be annoying)

**(3) Interviews: Confidence and Communication (and some business smarts)!** The advice here may not be able to be applied as ubiquitously as other insights since each club differs in terms of their focus and their application process. The general gist is that most clubs don't require you to be an expert or to have a masterful set of business skills: A lot of clubs are here to mentor you, and most have some sort of training process that you'll undergo prior to doing any project work or will teach you skills throughout the semester. That said, having a general business acumen goes a long way: Be able to express your thoughts clearly and logically so that the interviewer can understand your thought process. Be confident, even if you're unsure of what the answer is. Be as cooperative as possible. Be interesting, but not ""weird"": There's a fine line here, but avoiding saying things that would be potentially off-putting or that would raise a red flag.

**(4) Don't be discouraged and keep applying!** The average applicant only gets better over time, and the experience you get from networking, applying, and interviewing will only help you in the long run. My advice is to go to as many interviews as you can; apply to as many clubs as you reasonably can; and get to know as many people as you possibly can: Even if you end up getting rejected from every single club, in the following semesters, you will be vastly more prepared than other applicants. Your name may still be remembered, and your persistence might be rewarded: Personally, I'm always encouraged by returning applicants because it's awesome to see how they've grown in a semester and what has changed and how they might offer more to the club now. I was rejected from about 9+ clubs/organizations one semester which was probably my lowest point my first few semesters. Don't be discouraged, and look for new ways to fill your time and grow as a person (from joining other social clubs to finding a part-time job, etc.)

Some notes: Applying to clubs is a lot like dating in my opinion. Clubs are trying to assess the value you'd bring to them and how great of a fit you are, and vice versa, you should assess the value the club will bring to you and how great of a fit you are. If you don't really click with any of the people you meet or find yourself not liking the vibe of the organization, then find a different one. My time in the ""mid-tier"" club I was in had some of the best memories I'll make in college because the people I interacted with were fantastic human beings. The main reason why people stay in a club even though the club might not provide as much professional value anymore is because of the people who are in it.

Overall, good luck! Feel free to share different opinions down below: This is definitely just one person's recommendations and advice on how to potentially maximize your chances of getting into a business club. Everyone has a slightly different story of how they ended up in whatever business club they are a part of and mine is definitely not a comprehensive story. Also feel free to message about any Haas/pre-Haas related questions: As a freshman, I didn't have much guidance or mentorship and I definitely understand how stressful everything might seem!"

Personally, I went to an infosession today for what I *thought* was a less competitive club and I came away feeling like I wanted to join but wasn't good enough for them. Specifically, I don't think I had a lot of relevant experience in the industry and generally do not consider myself a ""likable, charismatic and experienced"" person for anything. 

So far, when I submit a resume/application, I've gotten an interview but haven't always passed out of the interview stage. However, those were for less competitive clubs. 

I know at the end of the day it's just some club run by undergrads who are probably as scared of the job market/life after college as I am, but let's be real, getting rejected from anything sucks. 

What makes it even worse is that I feel like many students here base their self-worth on their GPA, intelligence, club experience or internships at prestigious companies, and so, you know, getting rejected from some org just hurts that much more. 

Does anyone have any perspective or advice on how to mentally prep for 100% rejection?"

I aspire to work in the Bay area one day but idk if it's the most financially sound decision. UMD is a great CS school, but is Berkeley worth that much more?

Just a rough estimate but over 4 years: UMD = about $100k (given i get zero merit money), UCB = about $300k (also given i get nothing in merit, which is prob realistic). I'm overshooting both school a bit but basically, UCB would be at least doubled my state school's cost.

UCB: High cost of living, way more expensive, across the country transportation, amazing location.

UMD: Instate, lower cost of living, college park is kind of meh, stuck close to home-less than one hour drive, lots of people from school there."

Long story short, the rubric asked for a very specific answer, and it seems like if you didn't have \*exactly\* what he wanted, he docked.

I'm aware that keeping a consistent rubric makes it fair for everyone in the class, so I asked a GSI during office hours if I should submit a request. She told me to submit one if I wished but not to expect anything, which I can agree with. 

I visited Latimer for something else, and while taking the elevator down, I heard a bunch of (presumably) 3B GSI's talking about regrades and the quiz. It seemed like 2 of them were 3B GSI's and another was just another graduate student in the chem department. 

The 3B GSI's were like ""lmao they submitted so many regrades despite the rubric explaining why they didn't get points"" and the other (not) 3B GSi was like ""Well, break them early; let them know that if they're going to ask for a regrade, their entire quiz will be regraded."" 

Putting myself in their shoes, I get that it's annoying to get 23492349234234234 requests that were frivolous attempts to gain points, but nevertheless, their comments just rubbed me the wrong way. I feel like undergrads are treated like shit here already, and their comments (while being just n=3), confirmed that perception even more. I get that it's annoying to have to deal with regrade requests, but that's literally part of being a GSI. What do you want us to do; just let that huge point deduction go? 

Moreover, why is it necessary to ""break"" undergrads? I don't know exactly what she meant, but I thought she meant it as ""emotionally break them."" I do not mean that you should make 3B a joke class and give into every single regrade request, but it's not necessary to be crueler than necessary. 

They literally aren't even the ones who are approving/rejecting the requests; Marsden and the head GSI handle that (according to another GSI I spoke to who wasn't one of the ones in the elevator). Additionally, if the GSI's are annoyed that ""fuckin' stupid undergrads"" are wasting their time, why would you go and grade their entire quiz again? Doesn't that take \*even more\* time than just grading that one question again?  

I'm preparing to get downvoted to hell, but just wanted to put that out there."

I would've just felt really stressed out with the above combination of classes and would've likely gotten average grades across the board, which doesn't help with declaring economics OR being premed. Consequently, I chose to drop 3B/L and take it later. 

I've rearranged my schedule to fit in the premed requirements another way, but I wonder if it's even doable to be economics and premed here, or if me not being able to handle the above combination already shows that I should just back out of the premed track entirely. 

Any thoughts?"

Now she's ghosting me on social media/school email. I had her dad's number and tried texting him as well (number might be outdated, got it off linkedin), but got no response.

Her family is not poor, so if this is simply because of the money, it's out of stinginess, or lack of morals.

You have to pay ahead of time for parking, like a metered area on the curb.

I received a parking ticket at around 1PM b/c they said that I didn't pay for parking.

I did at around 11AM for 4 hours. The problem is that I paid in cash and I don't have a receipt. I never saw a printed receipt from the machine. I didn't take a picture of the the machine before I finished the transaction b/c I figured pressing the Green Button would finish it and give me a receipt. It didn't. It took me right to the ""please pay for parking"" screen.

The only way I could think of why maybe I wasn't in the system was that I may have not inputted my license plate number right. Like, maybe I was off by a letter or number, such as 0 or O. I actually think that this is the case. I took a pic of my car's plate after I first walked up to the machine b/c it said it needed the plate, not the lot number. It says to remember the lot number in the parking lot. So, I go back to my car and take a pic to then walk back to the machine. I enter the information into it believing that it's correct. I probably misread a Z as a 7. My plate has a border and it's thicker towards the middle, so if I glance at my phone, I mistook it for a 7 b/c it was at an angle from above instead of straight on. Also, the pic is time stamped to when I took it. I also took a pic of the machine around that time in case I needed to pay more.

I've never parked at this lot before. I didn't see anything that indicated that it was a permit only spot, if this happened to be the error. I don't think so because I think this lot is both permit and visitor parking.

I know the exact time I paid as well as other details. I contested this, but I wanted to know if others have had similar situations and/or success with disputes. 

I am pretty sure that I did attach the pics in my appeal, but I get paranoid about whether I did so or not."

He is, however, wondering if the IB major will be full of students intent on the medicine path, and making it ultra-cutthroat and competitive, both from an application standpoint first, and later in the classes. Are these legitimate concerns, or do most students who are interested in applying for med school going to be in the Molecular and Cell Biology track?

I guess I just really fucked up the case interview, lmao, which kinda sucks because I did practice a bit with Case in Point and McKinsey's sample interview questions. 

This was my first experience with consulting and business, ever, and I was actually amazed to see that I actually sort of like case interview questions. I'll admit that this rejection dampened my passion for consulting a bit but I'm mainly trying to improve from this. 

I guess I suck at thinking on my feet and didn't give a strong recommendation at the end for a strategy going forward. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to improve on case interviews going forward? 

Honestly, I fucked up an interview WAY MORE for an off-campus internship last week (also in brand strategy!) and still got an offer, but I guess Berkeley clubs just are, well...super exclusive :)))"

Last year, I applied to Berkeley as a media studies major and was accepted. Unfortunately, I failed my chemistry class which led me to revoke my acceptance because I could not fulfill the admission requirements. My GPA went from a 3.6 all the way down to a 3.0 because of that chemistry class.

My biggest question is: do I still have a good enough chance in getting into Berkeley? From what I’ve read online, to be accepted to Cal, you must have a 3.6 GPA, however for media studies major, the lowest GPA accepted is 3.2 so I’m hoping that this major isn’t super competitive to get into.

There are people, like me, who are on immuno suppressors or have a generally shitty immune system, so a small cold to you could mean pneumonia for us

Multi vitamins or just drinking lots of water is great way to keep your body up to shape without too much effort.

I'm taking MCB 102 this semester and have a couple questions about the course. There are 2 pop quizzes for each section of this course. The first section (pKa, pH, protein structure, etc.) is being taught by Merchant this semester. 

1) What should I expect to see on the quizzes? I know memorizing amino acids is really important for the first quiz, but I'm not sure to which extent I should memorize them. Should I memorize the pKas of side chains as well?

2) If you've taken the class, do you have any advice on how to study for these quizzes?

3) If you're currently taking the class, what resources are helping you understand the material? So far I've been reviewing the webcasted lectures and looking through the book, but I feel like there's probably more I can do.

Thanks in advance for your responses and go bears!!"

I am a grad student from Europe who will be doing a research stay at UC Berkeley for a couple of months starting this October. I will arrive in the US a couple of weeks earlier and was planning to visit some places in California (a couple of friends from home are coming with me for this ""tourism"" part).

Long story short, I'll have a rental car which I plan to drive to Berkeley and have it with me for the first 3 or 4 days to help carry my move-in stuff, baggage, do the first ""big"" shopping of things for my apartment, etc. Then I will return the car and walk or bike to campus for the remaining of my stay. 

All of this is to say that please bear (go!) with me since I have never lived not only in the US but in any city the size/type of Berkeley.

I have read the parking section on the City of Berkeley's website as well as several posts in this sub, but I still have some doubts. My apartment is located in RPP area J, so I assume I cannot park the car on or around my street Mon to Fri from 8am to 7pm, for more than 2 hours. However, how is this enforced? Does it mean 2 hours a day? What if I park the car for 2 hrs and then move it to a different spot on the same street (or the same RPP zone) and leave it there for another 2 hours, is this allowed? What does ""that block"" refer to in the following sentence from the [city's website](https://www.cityofberkeley.info/Customer_Service/Home/RPP_Residential_Preferential_Parking.aspx#enforcement) ""Those without an annual or visitor permit can park for a total of two hours on either side of that block""? In the same way, I assume that if I park the car at 7pm then I wouldn't need to move it until 10am the following day (8am to 10am being the 2-hr allowed free parking).

I have another question on the boundaries of the RPP areas. Looking at the [map](https://www.cityofberkeley.info/uploadedFiles/Public_Works/Level_3_-_Transportation/RPP_R(1).pdf), I understand the different areas marked with letters and colors. However, what does the gray line that surrounds the whole map mean? It says ""RPP-boundary"", so I assume that outside this boundary there is free parking on the street (apart from any kind of particular restrictions on particular streets). What about the white zones inside the ""RPP-boundary"" that don't seem to belong to any area? Is there free parking there? For instance, I see there's a big zone west of Adeline St that may be convenient for me that seems to not belong to any RPP area. Is parking there free and unrestricted?

Finally, apart from all these regulations and ticket avoidance, what about the safety of the car? Do you guys believe it is safe to park a car overnight without supervision in any of the areas that I've mentioned (all of them seem ""quiet"" and residential)?

Sorry for the long post, thanks in advance!"

Firstly, this is applicable to all Intramural Sports, how much is the commitment? As in, are there practices? Do you have to pay for jerseys or something of the sort to differentiate between teams? Or do you just show up? 

And secondly, I don't really have a huge group of friends who want to play basketball. In fact, I'm pretty much the only one I know who wants to play sports. So, I need to join a team ... but how does this work? 

I'm looking over most of the available teams and they already have 5 -12 players already on the roster and I'm wondering if all of these people already know each other and thus are coordinating, or if they don't really know each other and just happened to ask to join random teams. 

Do I ask to join random teams and hope they accept me? Or is this not how it usually works, and I utilize the Free Agents option? 

I'm completely new to this so I hope someone with more experience can help me out with this as I'm really lost and it costs 25$ to sign up and I don't wanna be stuck without any options after paying because I didn't do enough research."

I've been trying to start project 0 (Signpost) for the past two days but I literally can not get anything down. I understand the rules of the game: how it's structured, the rules, and how the game is won. However, when I try to actually start programming I have no idea what to put down / where to start. Perhaps I got too used to the 61A structure of it just telling you what you have to do for each section. I don't know If I should just drop the class and take it next semester with Hug? How different is the class besides the fact that he is actually a better lecturer (I'm also taking Data 100 with him)? Dropping the class now and taking it next semester would essentially set me back a whole semester in my progress towards my DS requirements. I attend lecture, lab, discussion, and even watch Hug's lectures but here I am still so confused on how to even start project 0. Does anyone have any advise on what I should do ? I obviously want to stay in the class so that I can declare as soon as possible but I'm just so lost and it's not like I'm not putting in work into the class and leaving it off to the side which is the opposite, I'm essentially putting all classes behind this one.

am I just expecting too much out of the course, support wise? how do I learn how to figure out things myself?

&amp;#x200B;

Are there any other clubs beyond consulting clubs I should consider joining to help improve my chances at landing where I hope to after graduation? I also want to join club for volunteering, a hobby, or exercise next semester once I settle down...any recs?

&amp;#x200B;

Now, for the concerns...I've been quite innocent in high school and am not really comfortable with drinking or getting a Nic addic. Unfortunately, many of the people in my consulting club seem to engage with that and I think I might be pressured to do something as part of it. Any advice on how to go about this...what's drinking culture like at other consulting clubs? Will my adversity to substance inhibit my ability to flourish here? I haven't really decided my moral thoughts on it."

I dont think the workload has been unmanageable thus far. I've easily been able to hit all of the EC points in Data 8 and 61A (I mean theres only been one). Should I expect that I'll continue to do well if I keep my previous work ethic up? Or does Cal, at some point during the semester, get so ridiculously hard that there's something I should brace for?

I know this is kind of an easy semester, and in the next couple I'll be a lot busier (Math 1B and 61B next semester, EE16A and CS61C or 70 next fall). I'm just looking for a reassurance that it'll all be okay."

Depending on how this goes, I'm definitely down to make different servers like skyblock or even modded minecraft if there's interest.

UC Berkeley's SHIP uses the Blue Shield of California network whereas NYU uses the Cigna PPO network, but my understanding is that neither Blue Shield nor Cigna pays for anything. 

I am trying to figure out what Wellfleet Insurance Company covers for psychiatric–mental illness residential level care and/or substance use inpatient or rehab level treatment (For NYU, components of the student insurance through Wellfleet is still active for certain timeframes and certain scenarios during a leave of absence. I'm assuming the same for UC Berkeley's SHIP). 

I've talked to several in-network facilities but I believe the most useful info I received was from a case manager who reached out when some of the facilities started to contact Wellfleet. I don't think the case manager directly works for Wellfleet, but rather a company called Hines &amp; Associates, Inc., which I'm assuming Wellfleet has some type of partnership or contract with for these types of special case management services (which I believe are common with insurance companies, but in my prior experiences seem are usually in-house).

Anyway, I think the case manager (from Hines &amp; Associates, Inc.) had the most relevant info, because it appeared she had the most experience with and exposure to actual cases of people with Wellfleet insurance coverage actually pursuing and receiving psychiatric–mental illness residential level care and/or substance use inpatient level treatment. And she told me that typically Wellfleet only covers 1-2 weeks of care/treatment at this level.

I will add that I was told numerous time that's Wellfleet generally does not approve more than 1 week of this level of care/treatment at a time. The patient/facility will have to check in with Wellfleet and at least on a weekly basis to continue coverage. I was not as worried about the weekly monitoring in approving coverage as I was worried by the case manager's observation that in general only 1-2 weeks of this level of care is ultimately covered by Wellfleet in total, based on her experience (the case manager was also a mental health counselor and when I gave info about my specific case/condition, she independently said that more than 1-2 weeks would definitely be medically needed for the situation).

I know this is a new plan for UC Berkeley students, but perhaps simply being smart and savvy UC Berkeley students, there might be people out there that have insight regarding this matter? 

Anyway, I hope this post is helpful beyond my self-service interest, and I sincerely hope at some point even one UC Berkeley student seeking this level of recovery or mental health–psychiatry care will stumble on it and shape their search for treatment in a positive/useful way."

Why would people celebrate if they were coming here to learn. This is clear evidence that something else is at play.

Theoretically, you could get a Berkeley education for free if you wanted to. All you'd have to do is start auditing courses as a non-enrolled student. Professors generally don't care when people sit in on courses. Some might even be flattered that a non-enrolled person cared enough to learn the material from them. 

But the reason why people don't to do that is ultimately because most people. don't. want. education. They want a diploma saying they went here, so that they can brag to others, and impress employers with how smart and hardworking they are.

This is pretty sad. 

I hear a lot of political folks talk about how ""education is important"" and how we should make tuition free. But if college isn't about education, and is instead about signaling intelligence, then it makes no sense to make tuition free. Think about it: the system is set up so that employers can determine who is the best worker by their level of education. If everyone has access to higher education, then nobody will be able to get the signaling benefits from going.

It is exactly isomorphic to the situation with a crowded theatre. If one person stands up in the theater, they will reason correctly that ""I will see the film better if I stand up."" However, it does not follow that if every single person in the theater stood up, then they would all be able to see the film better.

College is a filter that lets employers know who is smart and who isn't. Given this, why do people put this system in such a noble light? It's so obviously about getting into the most prestigious institution and being impressive. College has essentially nothing to do with the actual learning."

I’m a reporter at Business Insider and I’m working on a project that I thought some of y’all might want to get involved in. **We are interested in writing a feature story that would focus in on what a day in the life is like for an average Berkeley student.** We wrote a piece similar to this about an Oxford student in the past. (link included below). If any of y’all are interested, we would love to work with you to tell your story!

All we would need is about **10 to 15 photos of you documenting your day as a student.** These photos can be as mundane or as crazy as you like. I would also want to briefly chat with you about it all since I would be writing the story. This would be a great way to get your name out there in a major publication and tell the world a little bit about yourself.

Separately, we are also **interested in students who might be willing to share a copy of the essay they wrote that got them into Berkeley.** If you are really proud of your essay and still have a copy, we would love to be able to publish it. **We’d be willing to pay you for your essay.**

If either of these sounds of interest please let me know! Thank y’all.

d8cvx2,I am UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ. Ask me anything!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/d8cvx2/i_am_uc_berkeley_chancellor_carol_christ_ask_me/,carolchrist,242,2019-09-23 14:03:31,345,/r/berkeley/comments/d8cvx2/i_am_uc_berkeley_chancellor_carol_christ_ask_me/,NaN,"Hello, Reddit! /u/michaeldirda from the campus public affairs office here. With /u/lulzcakes‘s support we’re bringing back UC Berkeley’s chancellor, Carol Christ, for another Ask Me Anything session this week. We hosted an AMA with the chancellor [for the first time last October](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9mhs3p/i_am_carol_christ_chancellor_of_uc_berkeley_ask/), and she loved the format and the opportunity to field so many questions from the campus. 

Some brief background about Chancellor Christ: She first came to Berkeley just shy of fifty years ago to serve as a professor of English, and aside from a stint as president of Smith College from 2002 to 2013 has spent her whole career here. She was appointed Berkeley’s first female chancellor in 2017, and since then has worked extremely hard to fix the campus’ budget, develop a ten-year strategic plan for the campus, address the housing shortage, build community and improve the campus climate for people of all backgrounds, and more. You can learn more about her [on the chancellor’s web site](https://chancellor.berkeley.edu/chancellor-christ/biography).

I’m starting this thread now so you can think of questions and start voting on them, and she’ll begin answering on **Wednesday, September 25th at 4 p.m.**

As with last time, I'm just here to help the chancellor navigate Reddit’s non-intuitive interface; she’ll be responding to all questions herself. She says she’ll be happy to talk about whatever the community is interested in, though if there are areas that she does not know well enough she might ask me to circle back on a question if she doesn’t feel that she can fully answer it. 

Thanks so much and ask away!

Our last AMA went so well, Christ is coming back for another!

The Chancellor's reddit account is /u/carolchrist. This is not the actual AMA thread. The actual AMA is pinned to the top of the subreddit, and Christ will start answering questions in two days' time. You will have these two days to think of a question and post it in the thread. 

Please read the [previous AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/9mhs3p/i_am_carol_christ_chancellor_of_uc_berkeley_ask/) to see which questions were already asked.

-

-

**THE ACTUAL AMA**
-

* **No questions are off-limits. But keep it respectful and formal.**

Christ does not want to limit any sort of questions *at all* for this AMA. Nothing is off-limits. However, you must stay respectful and formal. Make sure you remain respectful and your question will not be removed. 

Joke questions *are* allowed. 

* **The AMA thread will be in contest mode until the actual AMA start time.**

This is because I don't want people to start long discussions before the AMA has begun. We also need time to promote this event on different channels and make sure everyone affiliated with the campus has time to create an account and post their questions. 

The Chancellor will start answering questions this Wednesday at 5:00PM. 

* **Parent comments only**

The Chancellor does not have enough time to read through chains of comments. We want original questions posted as *only* parent comments. If you want to piggyback off of another parent comment you liked, you may refer to it in a parent comment of your own. 

This may seem odd, but we want people to have as many chances as possible to get their questions answered, and we want the AMA to feel like an actual back-and-forth discussion between our community and the Chancellor. 

**All children comments will be deleted until Christ starts her actual AMA. After which children comments will be allowed.** 

Once the Chancellor comes in, I want her answers to be the only child comment to each parent comment. That way, even after this two day delay, you won't have to go hunting for Christ's answers, and you can follow-up on her answers more easily. 

In a future event, we may be able to have the Chancellor answer question that arose from discussions, but I don't want those long-winded discussions to start prematurely. 

-

-

-

---

---

Again, please be on your best behavior. We may have even more events in the future, and maybe the Chancellor would be open to coming to a subreddit meetup. This will only be possible if this AMA goes well. 

Stay respectful, ask your best questions, and 

**GO BEARS!!!**

The newfound freedom, the constant state of being surrounded by people, the way all the freshmen around me were so eager to make friends and have new experiences---I gained so much confidence and felt that this was really the beginning of the better part of my life. 

It was a slow and gradual buildup, but second year rolls around and I can feel the real anxieties taking over. I'm constantly thinking of how I don't have the professional or research experience to get the cs experience that I want. I really do love programming, but I'm struggling a lot in my current cs course. I know it's always hard to get your foot in the door for this kind of career, and I know I shouldn't compare myself to other people, but seeing my peers doing amazing work and having a great time with their clubs puts a small ache in me because I'm afraid I'll never have that. 

It feels like I'm always playing catch-up, chasing deadline after deadline, but nothing good is coming out of it. I cant find the time or motivation to do the personal projects I want to do, or apply for research that interests me. Every moment that I spend talking to friends or exercising or just laying still, there's always an unsettling guilt sitting in my chest. It's scary because every thought that runs through my head now is sprinkled with anxiety and guilt, and I really don't want that. I just want a chance to pause everything for a second and catch my breath, renew my perspective, but deadlines are still deadlines and time passed is still time passed. 

Has anyone else here been through this, or is currently experiencing it? If anyone has any advice, stories, thoughts, I'd love to hear it."

I kind of wanted to get higher because premed (and maybe law school) but oh well, I'm not that great at econ.

OH queues for project 0, a project that hilfinger dubbed an ""extended finger exercise"" exceeded 4 hours for the vast majority of students, and even then with such little time able to be spent on each student, for most people, it was of not much value.  
TAs providing conflicting answers on whether or not there are hidden tests, and whether or not our log score is our final grade or not, which had the effect of sending the entire class into a frenzy of confusion.  
AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF: the autograder for the project is apparently flawed and buggy, and course staff had to disable our logs while they fix the autograder. Keep in mind that this discovery was made AFTER the due date and AFTER countless claims of course staff stating our log score was our final grade, which obviously prompted a lot of students to conclude the project once they were happy with their score on glookup. Not even an announcement by course staff regarding the autograder or that they were investigating how it could have been exploited to pass tests. Nope, it was up to a student's post on piazza to break the news to us.   

Now we're essentially left in the dust wondering whether or not our grades will be lowered due to this new AG, despite all the things that course staff has told us.  

Sorry for the rant, hopefully someone else at least somewhat feels my frustration.

So basically Hilfinger released project 0, an “extended finger exercise”, and people got to work on it (most in the last 5 days from the looks of it). The project was completely new (never done before in 61b) and thus the AIs/ some TAs were not very informed on the project and thus couldn’t really help students. This problem snowballed into a hours long wait times in OH and 100s of piazza questions going unanswered. So this sets up the initial shitshow as this is a project that probably 10 people in the entire world know about/can really help (and the main one is the professor but he’s too busy to help). 

NOW, to make matters worse 😂, the autograder they provided was giving people incorrect scores as it wasn’t running the correct tests (from the looks of it, it might have been running the unit tests twice and not the integration tests). This meant that for certain cases, removing certain portions of your code actually increased your score! 

Students quickly realized this and explicitly asked TAs on piazza if they should make changes to their code to ensure the highest autograder score, even if it might not be what they think is correct. TAs responded saying yes and that the autograder score runs no additional hidden tests and that it will be the FINAL score/grade for this project. 

Fast forward to a short period after the original deadline for the project, the staff decides to FREEZE the current autograder logs and “modify” or fix it. They claim your score will not go down. Now this is very concerning for the people who followed the advice above about doing whatever it takes to get the highest autograder score as this score might now be changing. Additionally, people turning their project in late could now not see the results as all autograder logs were frozen until they released this new version like 1-2 days later. Rip. 

To top it all off, several students were telling others on piazza that they deserved a low grade if they tried to exploit the autograder and that they should drop the class if they think it’s too hard. This was essentially the gist of the piazza drama between students. 

Anyways, so now the staff has decided to hire more staff to help ease the long waiting times and has stopped working on individual code debugging in OH and has switched to conceptual help only. Seems like a step in the right direction."

For example, if the homework is assigned on Tuesday, I try to read the textbook chapters and take notes. Maybe this takes a day. But I'm trying to balance all of my classes too, so I usually start the homework a few days before its due. I sometimes cannot find the time to talk to GSIs or professors in their office hours, and I want to change this. At the same time, I don't want to be doing the homework only to solve it. I feel like even though reading the textbook takes a long time, it helps me understand things on a more conceptual level instead of doing the homework without a clue. 

In addition, I'm only taking 13 units, and I feel like there are students here who are taking so many more units than me, are able to do the homework faster, and do extra activities like clubs. I'm just amazed at how people can do this. I feel the only thing I do in life is always studying or walking to my class or eating, and I still can't manage my time.

What strategies do you do to get homework out of the way once it is assigned, and at the same time learn the content? Also, do you study with friends or by yourself? Any tips on surviving the homework and managing time? lol"

Recently, personal events have made me realize I wasn’t pursuing being a doctor for the right reasons, and I’ve realized my interests align more with business/financial sector. I’m considering applying to haas this fall, HOWEVER, i have a massive issue. I’ve been MCB pre-med and have not taken: econ, stats, ugba10. I know that technically pre requisite coursework can be completed the spring before anticipated admission. Thus, I believe I can still technically apply into haas. I am concerned that since the admissions board will see i have no prior experience in the business related coursework my application would immediately get thrown out. Does anyone have advice as to how I can improve my chances or has been in a similar situation? 

important note: Even if I would be allowed to apply my junior year, I cannot financially afford to stay the extra year at Cal in order to complete the degree."

&amp;#x200B;

I live in one of the dorms here at Cal, and the day we all moved in, my roommate did talk to me about whether it is fine to have girls over. I initially thought that it would be an occasional thing and agreed. But little did I know, I am wrong. Not exaggerating, I think I can count on one hand the number of nights that she has NOT slept over since move in on one hand. Like his girlfriend just comes over every, single night almost. Not only is it distracting when I am trying to study at night because they are kinda loud, but it's kinda restricting as well since I have to always worry about having a third person in the room. Like I can't even change in my room freely cause she's like always here. And, I've been woken up by her alarms more than anything else as she has early classes while my classes are later in the day.  And the other day, the morning after I got back from a frat party, I was so tired that I just crashed, knowing that I can sleep until whenever I want as I do not have class, she just comes over early in the morning and they just talked and shit, but it was so loud that I got woken up and had my sleep just ruined as I wasn't able to fall back asleep with how loud they were talking. Like I've been trying to be nice and stuff. I did my part in keeping the audio in the room to a minimum, always using earbuds whenever my roommate is in the room, and my roommate has kept it at a minimum to with how low his audio is whenever he's playing music while working or he uses earbuds too. But...it gets loud whenever his girlfriend is over because they are always talking and are loud. The worst part of all this is that she's like always over late at night. We're talking about sometime after 10PM and they are talking and stuff until maybe like 2AM in the morning before she finally goes to sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing is, I've also tried to be a good person and share my stuff with her. Like when she saw that I had lotion, she asked if she could use it. I thought it will be a one time thing, but then sometimes she just comes over to my side of the room and just use my lotion without asking again. And there's also other situations, but I won't reveal too much cause as of now, I don't want to cause any tension with my roommate because if I do reveal further, than he might know that I am the one who is writing this post.

&amp;#x200B;

This whole thing might seem unorganized and stuff, so please forgive me. As of now, I do not know what I should do as this isn't an issue that I can easily talk to my roommate about. It's not like his music is too loud or something like that."

I have two recommendation letters already, but I was hoping a third letter, especially from a UC Berkeley Haas professor, could be pretty helpful to my application since I’m interested in finance/business.

The problem is that I have not talked to the professor since the class ended last summer, and I’m 100% positive he does not remember me.

Would it be weird if I randomly email him out of the blue a year later for a letter? Has anyone had any success doing this? How should I approach the professor in an email about this?

Assume you have 50 guys and 50 girls. 40 of the 50 girls are cute, whereas only 20 of the 50 guys are cute. By this presumption, 20 cute guys go with 20 cute girls, and 10 un-cute girls go with 10 un-cute guys, leaving 20 un-cute guys, 20 cute girls.

Only 2 weeks ago I saw him in etcheverry talking to some other profs and felt nice to be able to wave to him and say hi. I also feel really bad that his kid lost a dad ;_;. Packard would always tell us how his kid was better than the class at control law lol. I hope that he does well in the future and follows his dad's footsteps.

I took 132 with him in fall 2017 and recorded some of his lectures! I hope some people find them as helpful as I did. I have 2 full lecture videos and 10 audio recordings and hope that people enjoy them as much as I do. You can see when he is trying to explain things and you can see that passion is teaching from these videos. He poured his heart and soul into Cal and I hope that people can see that from this video.

His legacy will live on in every version of MatLab from now on. and when ever I got a new version of MatLab I always looked for Packards contributions.

Anyways sorry for the rambling. I miss him a lot :(."

The show ended in 2010 and we re-booted it last semester, with praise from local audio leadership, including the News Director from KALW and the Head of Audio at Berkeley's Graduate School of Journalism. 

We have a solid team, but are looking for a few more people. Specifically, producers, editors, outreach, and especially reporters.

The aim of the show is to be great, personal, fun reporting. There are monthly half-hour episodes with 3-4 stories each. Think of like, This American Life, but local, and weirder/more experimental. If anyone out there seems interested in this, check out our application for more info:

IMPORTANT: APPLICATIONS ARE DUE SATURDAY.

Alright, that's all. Feel free to pm for details and good luck!"

I have no calculus experience. Kind of. The one time I was in a calculus class was about a year and a half ago and I dropped it after two weeks. 

Looking at my degree plan for Political Economy, I have to take some intermediate economic theory classes. There are some without calculus as a prerequisite, but I am worried they won't be offered / will fill up by the time I sign up for them.

How difficult would ECON 100A, ECON 101A, ENVECON 100, or UGBA 101A be for someone with no calculus experience? I plan on going to the Student Learning Center if I am stuck in one of these classes but would that even be able to save me if I have next to no knowledge of calculus?

I am currently having trouble with my next semester schedule. To provide some background, a general counselor for my college told me that my AP credit can cover all of my breadth requirements (I've heard mixed things about this). This semester I was planning on taking Chem 32 because of my weak chemistry coursework in high school (not AP Chem), but due to some schedule changes I had to drop it. Now knowing its not offered in the spring semester, I am hesitant to take 1A but will be studying the topics on my own. 

I am still not sure how to complete my 2nd semester schedule considering I am done with breadths (?). So far, I'm thinking Math 16B for sure, along with Chem 1A **or** Math 16B and Stats 20. I don't think I could handle all three. Aside from that I'm thinking a DeCal or a class to fill my units, since I am on financial aid. In order to fill my units I was thinking a Freshman Seminar or a one unit intro class to my major. If it comes down to it, I'm also willing to take simple breadth classes just for interest and the unit req (could also use recommendations). I'm also taking an R1B course so I'll hopefully be done with R&amp;C this semester.

I'm meeting my adviser next week to discuss my classes next week so I don't want to go in empty handed.

Thanks in advance!"

I was pretty good at CS and math in HS so I'm not sure what's going on here. I've been pretty stressed out ever since I came to Cal and needless to say it's not been the experience I'd hoped for.

Aside from the Tang Center billing me $332 for services I didn't purchase and the fact that I have no real friends here, Berkeley is alright I guess :/

I'm genuinely scared that I'm going to be placed on academic probation this semester. If my parents see how bad my grades are first semester, they probably won't pay for my tuition (why would they waste their money on a fuck up like me anyways)

In hindsight I should not have taken these difficult of classes my first semester. My academic courseload kept me from rushing or pledging anywhere, really building my social life, etc. And I cant even say it was worth it because of these shitty fuckin grades

How to proceed from here? I'm interested in CS but not really; I already know my chances of getting into the major are 0% (i highly doubt my grades in 61B and 70 will be good enough to make me 3.3+). I'd probably be more interested in majoring in something like Math or Econ, something that genuinely interests me, then again I was ""interested"" in math and computer science  but Berkeley took my schemas of both of these two concepts and twisted it in the most fucked-up way imaginable.

I was told that if you are intending on doing this and doubling with econ and business, you should not take econ 136 because it is an equivalent of one of the core Haas classes - UGBA 103. However, I want to get some finance coursework on my belt before applying to companies for, well, finance internships in the spring/next fall. I have already declared economics last semester, so I think I can get into 136 with phase 1.  
Basically, I am wondering what happens if I take ECON 136 and then get into Haas, and take 103? Do I just not get credits for 103? I was also told to instead take ECON 138 as it is a financial economics course, but is not equivalent to 103. Is this advisable, or is 136 a sorta prereq to 138?

I just think finance is cool lmao any help is appreciated!!"

Monday night around 12:30 in the Parker Street area, my boyfriend and I walked into our bedroom to get changed after a shower. After a couple minutes, my boyfriend went to the living room and that is when I looked up and saw half of someone’s face in my small window. I shrieked in panic and they ran off. When we opened the door, we saw a white pickup truck speed off towards Warring St. When we checked the window where I had seen him, our porch chair was propped under the window where he was peeking, confirming there was someone there. I only saw the side of his face and eye before he ran off, which from what I remember, light blue eyes and hairless fair skin. Judging by his skin, he looked to be around 25-30 years old and because he needed a chair to reach the window, I would say he’s below or just at 6 feet. I only saw face skin which might mean his hair line is further back (not too sure). As I was doing some research, I found an article posted in 2018 (linked below) of a similar situation and a video of a Peeping Tom at large . The description seems to match up with what little I saw, especially the face shape and hairline.  I do not believe this is the first time he’s come around as I have heard sneaky sounding footsteps before or thought I had seen someone’s face in the window, but I might have dismissed it as just my imagination and a little bit of denial. Do not take these things lightly! Please respond with any similar experiences, additional info, or advice. There is a police report filed but don’t know how much they will actually do to help find him. Please keep your doors locked and blind shut tight!

Various PGE materials say they'll notify in advance, but the question is whether they will actually do that..."
df8q4y,Frustrated with school..

I feel like I'm doing a lot of stuff, but I can't seem to shake off this feeling that I'm just 'doing' instead of 'learning'. All these lab assignments, hw, projects, exams seem to cover a lot of fundamental material plus more, which I really like, but I still feel like I'm not learning much. Let me explain. Our last homework was on coding some some classes using Input/Output stream. I looked up the stuff and found the way to implement the code. It took me a while to figure out the homework, but I still managed to finish it to get the full score. The thing is that two weeks passed now, and I don't remember a thing I did or how I did it. What about the infamous 'mini' project, which was meant for 'extended finger exercise'? It took me 30+ hours to finish. I felt accomplished at the time I finished it, but I still didn't understand like 3/4 of the code that was implemented for us. 

For me, I always try to understand as much as I can with my limited time, but I feel like this overwhelming amount of assignment actually just make me 'do' stuff. Yes. I do understand you learn by doing, but with this amount of hw, labs, projects and exams, I just don't learn much. At best, I feel like I'm just being exposed to a lot of stuff and just doing them as class goes. In 61A, I think it was the same thing. I finished all 4 projects by myself without needing much help, but I honestly don't remember much. Only thing I remember is how to do for loops, while loops and make basic class and that's it. Sure, I was exposed to the concept of functions, recursion, OOP, etc., but again, I don't feel confident in any of the topics. I mean, for a person like me, how can I get a job at tech? I know how to google stuff for something I need and can seem to read the code and apply the idea, but next day I wouldn't know what I did... Some people seem to suggest that I should find personal projects to apply my knowledge, but I can hardly keep up with school and I really don't have time to even think about doing a side project.

Is there any person who felt the same way like me and still was able to land a software engineering job...?"

Here are my favorite places to cry on campus. 

Outside of Soda (next to Cafe VA). Everyone usually minds their own business because they're busy doing work. Also, it's usually a little bit sunny which makes the situation better. If you're crying you might as well be in a nice environment with some plants around you.

Benches near strawberry creek. I've found that nobody is ever in the naturey part of campus, so it's really nice to just sit on the benches and look at the creek and trees and cry to yourself as much as you need, and nobody will bother you. 

Single bathrooms in Dwinelle Hall. These are conveniently located right outside lecture halls just in case you need to excuse yourself for a good cry. 

**Hot takes**:

During a midterm or exam. This is controversial, but nothing beats just silently letting tears run down your face during the exam where everyone else is focused on their own work. Bonus points if a TA makes eye contact with you while you cry.

Cory bathrooms. Listen...I know it's grimy. But nobody's ever in there because it smells awful, and you can't smell how bad it is if your nose is stuffy enough from crying.

Feel free to add your own recommendations!"

Berkeley student body,

Next **Wednesday October 16, 2019** at **2:00PM**  I will be standing at the U.C. Davis Coffee House patio in order to protest  against the silencing of Pro-Hong Kong ideas, posters, etc on campus. I plan on  standing there with a homemade paper poster for all to see, both those  who support and are against the Hong Kong protests.

**I invite anyone who wishes to be part of this to join me with posters and, most importantly, your voice.**

Some poster ideas can be found in this Google Drive link \[GRAPHIC VIOLENCE AHEAD\]: [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ADEwyApwcCfWWtuingnfshN0oS9D-ZaC).

Although there has been a previous post on alternative ways to show support for Hong Kong ([Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/dfnaop/ideas_for_supporting_the_hong_kong_protests/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)),  I think people should physically show that we support the Hong Kong  pro-Democracy protests. Posters are powerful methods of spreading a  message and creating a space for dialogue, but to support such discourse  ***WE, THE STUDENT BODY***, are a valuable for showing support.

To  show support and spread the word, I have created a Facebook event page.  PLEASE feel free to share this event and spread it around, we must show everyone who we are as students at the University of California system:  [https://www.facebook.com/events/390209534981368/](https://www.facebook.com/events/390209534981368/)

**IF YOU WISH TO JOIN, PLEASE:**

* Do  not voice out racist, xenophobic, or other offensive rhetoric (examples  of such can be found in the comment sections of this post: [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/dfmd6y/video_of_chinese_students_ripping_off_the_poster/)).
* Be  aware that this could draw negative reactions from individuals. This  could be through speech or physical contact. It is my hopes that we can  all avoid any physical conflicts at all costs.
* There  was a previous post by another U.C. Davis student asking for ideas to  support Hong Kong protests without being retaliated against. I fully  understand where this student is coming from, it can be scary to swim  against the current. *I, for once, am not afraid*. Although I will be at the protest wearing a bandana and a green cap I am not afraid to show who I am to the campus.

***If you guys could please spread the word it would be greatly appreciated!*** 

Yours sincerely,

With finals on the way, and as the existential dread of failure slowly replaces your sanity, time is running out to establish a proper relationship with your professors.

This is how I did it back when I attended Berkeley. Perhaps my list will be of use to some of you. **GO BEARS!**

1. Under the bridge outside Dwinelle. No one ever checks this place except homeless people doing drugs. And chances are, some of the homeless will have viagra (make sure it's viagra). This place is extra convenient because it's right outside tons of classrooms, so you can convert on your grades in record time. 

2. Wheeler bathrooms top level. No one ever goes here because of how inconvenient these bathrooms are to get to. Not even the homeless. This means you have full privacy, but the clear and obvious downside being of course a severe lack of viagra from nearby homeless folk. You'll have to make do in other ways.

3. A bit of a hot take, but right in the middle of class. This may backfire if your professor is seeing another student, creating an immediate turf war assuming your professor is one of low libido. But a benefit not found with other methods is that, if you were to court successfully, no other student would dare approach that same professor due to pack mentality kicking in. Extremely valuable if the class is curved. 

You may also use these methods to sleep with your GSIs if you're truly desperate."

I'm printing out a bunch of California Independence and Texan Independence posters and will be posting them around campus. PM me if you want to help. Thank you."

I hope this is okay to post here. I'm taking a (potentially) solo trip to Berkeley. There's a play at Berkeley Rep that I really want to see. I would fly out of Phoenix and into Oakland. Considering staying at the YMCA in downtown, considering the price and proximity to the theatre. I would also like to take some time to go into San Francisco via BART. 

The only way I can really see getting from the airport to downtown Berkeley is via Lyft/Uber, but is there another way (besides renting a car myself) that I could take? 

Also, any tips about the BART system? I'm comfortable with systems like the Manhattan Subway, but I've never really used public transport in California yet. 

On top of that, anything I should know going into Berkeley as a female traveler? I've been to big cities on my own, and am pretty self-aware. Anything locals or uni students have to share with me, I'm all ears. 

AND, bookstores! What's some of the best bookstores to visit nearby? I always make it my goal to visit a unique/local bookstore or two in every new city/town I visit.

What are the averages on his midterms, typically, and how generous is the curve?

Let’s say I get a massive list of corrections for a submission. Clearly handing it over for her to knock out is an ethical no-no. But like, what if she does the first 35 pages, I do the last 10, and proof it before turning it around?

Or let’s say I’m need help with a clinical assessment. Again, having her do it is clearly inappropriate.  But...what if she does the post testing analysis and maybe a first draft of the analysis and narrative that I polish up and double check?

I also think that Data Science in itself is pretty interesting and related to if I want to apply to grad school. (But taking Chem + Bio will probably tank my GPA...)

 Basically,

1) Would this path allow me opportunities to pursue a career in computational biology the same way an MCB degree would? (in academia or some BioTech industry) 

2) Is this a manageable Double Major path to follow?

3) Are there better ideas other than doing CS + DATA with a Genetics Emphasis?

I've heard a lot of different things about different classes so pls lmk if you have any recommendations for another low work-load CS class.

For anyone else with a similar question, I can list the CS classes I've taken in order of difficulty (lowest to highest):

1. **CS186:** Weekly homeworks are just simple understanding checks, &lt;10 minutes. Longer coding homeworks (basically projects) were pretty easy and spaced out throughout the semester. Midterms were easy.
2. **CS188:** There were 5 projects, so if you struggle with projects I guess this class isn't the best for you, but to be fair they were all pretty easy fill in the blank functions. None of them took me more than 5 hours. Weekly homework is gradescope homework and a written portion, together can be down in less than 2 hours. Midterms weren't particularly *easy,* but they're pretty fair. I also thought it was pretty interesting, which always helps make a class feel easier. 
3. **CS61A/61B:** I assume most people interested in this post have already taken these but including them in my list to give an idea of my ranking of difficulty. I also had the stress of declaring while taking these which puts on more pressure to do well and makes it seem harder.
4. **CS70:** Like 170, but a bit easier
5. **CS170:** Weekly problem sets took me pretty much all day, difficult midterms - basically pretty accurate with what other people say about 170. Given all that though I still think it's one of those classes you have to take. 
6. **CS61C:** My least favorite class I've taken at Berkeley. Projects were awful and extremely disorganized, midterms were awful. I didn't think the material was interesting but that's just me, I know people who liked the material.

[Here's](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qgPEICPPCAI2T7On8gJ7kle8gaMivHu337ps4q_psdI/edit#) a google doc with a breakdown of other CS classes

Bonus: Technical Electives I've taken

1. **GEOG 183** (cartographic representation): This is seriously one of the easiest most enjoyable classes I've taken at Berkeley. Didn't do any of the readings and never had to do work outside of class because you can finish the assignments during class. If you know how to use illustrator, you won't have to learn a thing. You just use illustrator to make maps. It's pretty fun actually.
2. **PHILOS 140A** (intermediate logic): First part is propositional logic, then first order logic. Propositional logic is a breeze after 70. The class isn't *easy* but it's definitely doable. Weekly problem sets take about 2 hours, both midterms were take home and they were pretty much just longer problem sets."

I have a 33ACT and I think a 4.21 UC GPA. I’ve demonstrated business interest as a marketing intern, taking business courses, other things, and i plan on writing a business(elaborating on interests in economics) essay for the UCs. I’m also in-state and each year a lot of students from my school get accepted and go, so that’s helpful.

Chem Bio major here. So I’ve been doing CS as a hobby since I was like 9 years old, and programming is one of my favorite pastimes and I’d consider myself to be pretty good at it.  I am considering minoring in CS, but not if it’ll leave me with no time to take the classes I wouldn’t have the opportunity to learn about otherwise. (You can easily learn CS online, but not Drugs and The Brain for example).

So I’m concerned because adding 61A would bring my unit schedule up to 19 units, which for a lazy guy like me seems like a lot. 

For somebody with ~8-9 years of CS experience, how easy would CS61A be? Is attendance in lecture mandatory? Can somebody provide me examples of projects/homework y’all gotta do so I can get an idea of whether or not I could breeze through it?

Thanks,"

I got slightly over 1 standard deviation below the mean, and now I'm pretty certain I have no chance of declaring CS. I'm so upset because I really do love programming and want to be a CS major, but I just... *can't* with math. I know people do DS as an alternative sometimes, but I'm really not interested in data science. I just feel so terrible right now and don't know where to go from here. People will say to work hard and ace the midterm and final, but realistically, I just know that's not happening. Even if I do slightly better on the next exams (which is unlikely), the weight of this bombed midterm has already destroyed a huge part of my grade. With this midterm grade, I can't get the grade I need to declare CS and I'm totally lost right now. I don't want to do any other major :( 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any advice for this position? I was thinking of dropping and retaking, but then I won't be able to proceed with other technical requirements next semester (I'll have to just take 70 again because I wouldn't know my major yet). Also, I just am unsure if I will do better next time, so if I fail again, I'll waste yet another semester-- and essentially, an entire year-- taking no technicals towards my major. The other option is appealing, but I have no idea if people actually get in through appeals. 

All I know is that I really want to be a CS major, but I think I'm fucked. I don't want to settle for anything else... I just feel like total shit now because I probably won't even be able to declare the major I want."

(The way the questions are phrased are also more conceptual than I'm used to)... many I'm not studying properly for this midterm? 

Besides study more, PNP the class (which I am probably going to do), what other advice do you have for me? I am worried about not even passing the class if I do poorly on the final especially. I need this for the L&amp;S breadth requirement and I don't know what I'd do if I don't pass it. Has anyone else been in this class before in a similar situation? Also are there any tutoring resources for this class, besides generalized physics tutors?

I want to start preparing for CS interviews for the big tech companies internships. I have taken AP Computer Science A and am in an intro to data structures and algorithms class.

Say we make 151/162/164/170/126 the 4-class required core for CS. One class in hardware, one class in systems, one class in languages, one class in theory, and one semester of probabilistic analysis is roughly what CMU has as UD core.

Not academically, but socially. I'd consider my social life so far to be decent. Made a couple friends, one of which I would consider a good friend. Roommates are chill, and we hang out occasionally. Joined a couple clubs. But for the most part most of the connections I've been making feel pretty shallow. People you wave to on the street, but not really the kind to invite you over to chill at night. I live in the units, but I haven't really connected with the people on my floor. Again, its more of a surface level, acquaintance relationship. Meanwhile I see posts on Instagram of people heading out to San Francisco, having fun at football games, etc. Now I'm not the most social guy, but for the most part I've been pretty content with how things are turning out. I like to tell myself that I'm being a lot more social than High School me. But for the past couple nights, I've had some pretty bad anxiety over how the rest of my life is going to look for me. If I'm having trouble making friends and connections here at college, I tell myself that my social life will be completely screwed once I graduate. This is kind of straying into incel territory, but how am I going to find the person I'll spend the rest of my life with, if I haven't been able to even meet anyone here? The past couple of nights I get into this vicious cycle of looking up something like ""scared about life after college"", and the next thing I know it's one in the morning and I'm going through some suicidal guys profile that I found on a thread about virgins over 40, legit shivering and scared shitless that that's what the future has in store for me. I've never felt this kind of anxiety in my life, and it just makes me want to lie in bed all day doing nothing, which I know is the exact opposite of what I should be doing. But it feels so difficult to change. I tell myself that the friend groups have already been established. I went to a party for a club a couple a weeks ago, which I really enjoyed, but I missed the chance to get involved in that scene since I didn't go to any frat parties during GBO.

another way

1 is an integer a whole number

0.888... is a non-integer it is not a whole number

0.999... is a non-integer not a whole number

when a integer 1 =a non-integer 0.999... maths ends in contradiction

2)1)Darwins book is called On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection ....

but

this paper shows natural selection is not the origin of new species Natural selection is not the origin of new species

Natural selection does not generate new genes/species Natural selection adds no new genetic information as it only deals with the passing on of genes/traits already present and it will be pointed out genetics cannot account for

the generation of new species/genes as it is claimed the generation of new genes [via mutation] is a random process due to radiation, viruses, chemicals etc and genetic cannot account for these process happening as they are out side the scope of genetics physics, chaos theory etc may give some explanation but genetics cant

2) Biologist cant tell us what a species is -without contradiction thus evolution theory ie evolving species is nonsense

Biologists agree there is species hybridization

but that contradicts what a species is

3) biologist tell us they investigate life

but

they cant tell us what life is-they can tell us what life does but cant tell us what life is they cant even give a definition of life that is not nonsense"

Out of all lectures which I've plowed through so far, UC Berkeley ones seem to be the most adequate and I'd like to dig deeper but it looks like the lectures aren't publicly available anymore past 2013.

Is there any way to obtain new material from 2018 / 2019? I'm interested in Athropology, philosophy and psychology. I'm also willing to pay a symbolic sum if that helps.  
If such thing is not possible, maybe you can recommend some other university which has made their full lectures available for the public?

Excerpts of the dialogue:

&amp;#x200B;

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi returns to the Porter camera system at 1031 for a check-in. ""Nancy Pelosi is here and she wants $3 billion to keep the border open at Monterrey. $3 billion dollars to keep that shit open do you believe that?"" Matthew Porter commentates. Pelosi states 1034: ""I think he \[Brian Schlenker\] needs to be removed. I think we need to get this guy out of here"". Speaker Pelosi then agrees to call back at 7pm PST. Gigi Hadid at 1034: ""Thanks for calling us. I've got you down for three minutes"". Pelosi don't worry about that I've got 3 billion.  

&amp;#x200B;

1031 Matthew Porter: Nancy Pelosi is on and she wants $3 billion dollars to keep the border open at Monterrey. Three billion dollars to keep that shit open do you believe that?

1033 Nancy Pelosi: I don't think that will be necessary unless you insist.

1033 Donald Reeves?: We insist.

1033 Nancy Pelosi: Ok then I guess we have a deal.

1033 Matthew Porter: Thank you Mrs. Pelosi.

1033 Nancy Pelosi: Please call me Speaker Pelosi.

1033 Nancy Pelosi: We want to make sure you have safe passage at Monterrey.

1033 Matthew Porter: We appreciate that Speaker Pelosi.

1033 Gigi Hadid: I think we may have to scale back a little bit though.

1033 Nancy Pelosi: Gigi I think we'll be just fine.

1035 Nancy Pelosi: God damn it! I want Kamala to get a billion out of yours, not out of mine.

1035 Gigi Hadid: I think we can accommodate you but we need to find out if Monterrey will be open on the 30th of January.

1036 Nancy Pelosi: Of course it will Gigi.

1036 Nancy Pelosi: $3 billion goes a long way Peter.

1036 Peter Thiel: Excellent answer.

1043 Gigi Hadid: I think we need to give Kamala a billion dollars to keep her \[happy\].

1043 Matthew Porter: I think we can do that but we need to get her to do something first.

1043 Gigi Hadid: She did. We got her fucking Rahm Emmanuel Monday morning \[14Jan\] at 235. 

1043 Matthew Porter: Perfect, then we're all set. Send her the billion.

1043? Nancy Pelosi: She'll accept the money, I guarantee it.

1043? Gigi Hadid: Nancy thank you for everything.

&lt;ch4&gt;

1036 Donald Reeves: Don't listen to her. She will close down the border if it's not there. Make sure she gets the $3 billion.

Earlier at 11:27, New York Senator Charles Schumer checks in on the Porter camera system. ""We're jerking off to Brian Schlenker, we want you to join us."" says Matthew Porter. ""Obviously I can't jerk off with you, but I can keep watching him in the apartment."" replies Senator Schumer, who also comments: ""...crazy that you expect me to stay here while you jerk off.

 so recently i went on a date with a somewhat attractive asian girl (probably thanks to references to nujabes, sushi buffets, and boba on my tinder profile, asian bitches are **way** too easy to impress lol). once we started talking, (of course) one of the first things I asked about was her major. she said she was data science. (at this point i realized our intellectual capacities were *not* the same) i said ""oh, must be nice to have so much free time.""  anyways I told her I was **EECS** and my major is notoriously known for a large workload, which is why I suggested that. she didn't really seem interested in me for the rest of the date, and started fidgeting around and responding with simple “oh”s or “mhm”s , especially when i was explaining some of the various internships i had applied to, or even the math competition i had received first place in in eighth grade. at the end of the date i suggested we could go back to her place (my dick was pretty hard after talking about EECS so much) and I could maybe give her tutoring for one of her classes, which of course I suggested the content of would be pretty trivial to me. she said she couldn't and that she had to go pick her friend up from SFO (i had reason to believe otherwise, as she mentioned she didn’t have a car when i told her I interviewed for a self driving car startup). overall she seemed pretty dismissive and I think my intellect was quite frankly intimidating to her. the worst part is I had just paid a LOT of money to buy the outfit i wore on the date (unlike other nerdy eecs majors, i actually have a taste for cool clothes like GOLF le FLEUR, supreme, and bape (r/streetwear, anyone?)) . anyways if anyone knows where to find an attractive EECS girl let me know, but im not holding my breath lol.

Sure, WWPD and Environment bullshits are studiable. But the coding problems are impossible to study for. Either you know how to do it or you don't. Either you can think of the solution, or you can't. CS does require a CS brain, and some people just don't have it. I clearly don't have it. Im Coe so thank the lord I don't have to declare all that bullshit. But lmao I was thinking of doing EECS LMAAAAAO. Never. I'll probably end up doing some other bullshit ass engineering major just because I don't have the brain to do what I am interested in. What a fair world man! Crazy how some people are born with abilities that make their lives better, while I have literally nothing going for me. Im not even smart enough to pursue what I thought I liked. If there is a god, fuck me, he's one unfair son of a bitch. just practice!!! fuck off. I've heard that shit a million times and it's just complete and utter dogshit. Why do I even go to fucking college, when I know I'll fail like the fucking miserable loser I am. 

I could keep practicing and studying for CS, but I think I'd rather spend my fucking time jacking off. Wouldn't change anything but I guess I would be happier right? Fuck this fucking dogshit ass course, literally designed only for people who are smart enough to solve the bullshit ass fucking questions and problems. But, hey, its not their faults im fucking retarded. CS really shouldn't even be a major in college. They don't teach you anything. they just give degrees for people with CS brains, they just literally learn the syntax, but the logic and problem solving is literally innate to them. all the cs courses do is teach syntax, and let the smart people use the new syntax and fucking language they learned to solve the problems like the fucking geniuses they are. The logic is already in their brains, and people like me learn the syntax, but still have no fucking clue how to solve the problems in the course.

I’m a sophomore, recently interested in pursuing a career in accounting. I’ve seen the CFRM page and looked into the BCPA program, so on a formal academic level i think i’ve got it figured out (or maybe not? If you have tips on that not, i’d love to hear it). But what I’m wondering is how people get experience in the field. From what i understand, accounting seems like a profession that requires specific technical training, like nurses or mechanics, yet you don’t need a CPA to become a general accountant. (This mostly stems from previously being premed and the idea of going into a career without a million years of school is still mind-boggling)


Do you just apply to accounting firm internships with no accounting experience?? Do you do general consulting work? How and where? Are there any accounting-specific clubs on campus to look into? Overall, just very confused about finding work in the industry and how to use my time in college to work towards it. Thanks!"

I've heard that Cal is a great, challenging school, which is what I want. I've also heard of some rather extreme politics that I'd rather not have to deal with on a day to day basis. How common are people pushing their political beliefs, and if I'm not super far to the left on the political spectrum, am I going to fit in? I prefer to not worry about politics at all, and focus on my own life.

Last thing, I know Cal is super popular for their CS program. Because of this, should I expect a lot of competition to get into classes? If I choose the school, I want to graduate on time.

I’ve grown up in the Bay Area my entire life. I know that the weather used to never be like this - sure we’d occasionally hear about wildfires on the news, but never within a 20 mile radius of our homes. 

And now? 

Last year the smoke was so thick that you could see it inside Evans. It triggered the fire alarm in the middle of the day. The sky turned red, and between the color and the dust it looked like we were in the middle of an apocalypse. My friends with asthma and other lung conditions had to start taking extra medication. 

Then this year, with all the PG&amp;E bullshit. Not knowing whether classes are going to be continued or cancelled, whether we’ll have midterms on Monday or Wednesday or Friday - or hell if they’ll be cancelled all together so the weightage of our finals increases (note that Davis implemented a policy similar to this last year). We don’t know what’s going to happen to dead week or finals week, and how this is going to impact the organizations, research, and jobs that we’re a part of. 

Don’t get me wrong - I really do think the University is doing a good job on the whole given the circumstances. There are also people who are fighting for their houses and their lives up in NorCal who are objectively far worse off, and we need to do everything we can to help them (including but not limited to simply sending thoughts and prayers). 

All in all, though? This is also a pretty scary time to be at Cal."

I graduated from school last December and am currently working as a UX Designer at the corporate office of a manufacturing company. It's okay as a starting job fresh out of school, but it's not fostering my UX skills in the capacity that I want and I have plans to seek other opportunities once my one year is up next April. 

I'm intrigued by the new Experience Lab program but I see that it just launched its first semester. If you are currently enrolled, what are your opinions so far? How has it been? Seems like the current program is very marketing-oriented with some HCD/Design Thinking aspects. This seems potentially valuable for me because my current role is very UI-heavy and I worry I'm getting rusty on my strategy skills. However I'm wary that it is just another ploy for profit that entices students with the study abroad/""field experience"" sells but is in reality useless at the end of the program. I understand that part is up in the air though, since the program just launched.

If you're enrolled/have completed in the Professional Program in UX at Berkeley Extension, what are your opinions? How has it been? I stumbled upon this while researching Experience Lab and I am interested in this as well. 

Are any of these continuing education programs worth looking into? I'd love to go back to school for a formal UX education but considering as I'm from Texas, school is expensive and so is the Bay Area, that would be a huge life decision to make. Just looking for insights and testimonies. Thanks!"

""Nancy Pelosi is here and she wants $3 billion to keep  the border open at Monterrey. $3 billion dollars to keep that shit open  do you believe that?"" Matthew Porter commentates. Pelosi states 1034: ""I  think he \[Brian Schlenker\] needs to be removed. I think we need to get  this guy out of here"". Speaker Pelosi then agrees to call back at 7pm  PST. Gigi Hadid at 1034: ""Thanks for calling us. I've got you down for  three minutes"". Pelosi don't worry about that I've got 3 billion.

1031  Matthew Porter: Nancy Pelosi is on and she wants $3 billion dollars to  keep the border open at Monterrey. Three billion dollars to keep that  shit open do you believe that?

1033 Nancy Pelosi: I don't think that will be necessary unless you insist.

1033 Donald Reeves?: We insist.

1033 Nancy Pelosi: Ok then I guess we have a deal.

1033 Matthew Porter: Thank you Mrs. Pelosi.

1033 Nancy Pelosi: Please call me Speaker Pelosi.

1033 Nancy Pelosi: We want to make sure you have safe passage at Monterrey.

1033 Matthew Porter: We appreciate that Speaker Pelosi.

1033 Gigi Hadid: I think we may have to scale back a little bit though.

1033 Nancy Pelosi: Gigi I think we'll be just fine.

1035 Nancy Pelosi: God damn it! I want Kamala to get a billion out of yours, not out of mine.

1035 Gigi Hadid: I think we can accommodate you but we need to find out if Monterrey will be open on the 30th of January.

1036 Nancy Pelosi: Of course it will Gigi.

1036 Nancy Pelosi: $3 billion goes a long way Peter.

1036 Peter Thiel: Excellent answer.

1043 Gigi Hadid: I think we need to give Kamala a billion dollars to keep her \[happy\].

1043 Matthew Porter: I think we can do that but we need to get her to do something first.

1043 Gigi Hadid: She did. We got her fucking Rahm Emmanuel Monday morning \[14Jan\] at 235.

1043 Matthew Porter: Perfect, then we're all set. Send her the billion.

1043? Nancy Pelosi: She'll accept the money, I guarantee it.

1043? Gigi Hadid: Nancy thank you for everything.

&lt;ch4&gt; 

1036 Donald Reeves: Don't listen to her. She will close down the border if it's not there. Make sure she gets the $3 billion.

2134 Christopher Porter: A fifth child has died at the hands of Bill DeBlasio.

2134  Matthew Porter: Thing is Bill \[DeBlasio\] didn't even want the fifth  one, but he did it anyway because that's how bad he wants to be a part  of the Illuminati.

2135 Bill DeBlasio: \[regarding Illuminati 'ownership' of DeBlasio\] ...seriously, you already owned me with $100 million dollars.

2137  Bill DeBlasio: I think I figured out what you're doing. You want me to  go on record saying I killed five kids. But here I am on video so what  difference does it make? I killed five kids by raping them. Does that  fucking work for you?

2137 Donald Reeves: That'll do Bill thank you.

2138 Bill DeBlasio: Now where is that little minx I'll finish off with her.

2138 Gigi Hadid: So he just fucked five kids and killed them now I have to finish him off?

2138 Patricia Porter: Gigi is gonna finish \[DeBlasio\] off. She has to do that.

i was thinking about maybe switching my major to cogsci if im trapped to medical school with neurobiology. im more interested in humanities side of things anyways, but that worries me too because 

1. my first semester would have kind of gone to waste, trying to do pre-reqs for mcb instead of cogsci (or any other major for that matter)

2. cogsci (and other majors i've looked into) is impacted, so i might not even get in. what if i make all this fuss and switch majors for nothing

I’m currently taking Math 54 and CS 61A and are doing... not terrible but not too good either(projected B+ for 61A and A- for 54)

Anyway, I’d like to take from 16-20 units next semester. Besides either EE16A or EE16B+EE47D, i’m also thinking about taking 61B and either CS70 or Math 55. I’m also thinking about a easy writing class(according to berkeley time)

So my question are as the following:
Give that i’m doubling in math and CS, 
1, should i take math 55 or cs70? imo 70 has better professor but heavy course load(especially with 61B cuz i wanna do well and have a better GPA), while 55 has shitty professor but comparatively lighter course load.
2, should I take 16A or 16B + 47D? taking 16A would be easy for me bc im taking 54 this semester, but it might waster some of my time, especially when I’m trying to double major and graduate in 4 years; on the other hand, 16B and 47D(if i can get enrolled) does put me on a faster pace, but might result in heavier course load and less stable foundation
3, i’m taking 15 units this semester and really want to catch up. one of the reasons i’m not doing ideally this semester is because i tried out a lot of clubs which kind of used up part of my time(as well as the adjustment). i’m wondering if 3 techs + 1 writing(16U) or overall a 16-20 unit schedule is doable.

So, I am first of all not planning to go to grad school.

I know for Data Science most end up either taking more CS heavy classes while others take Stat heavy classes but then that brings up the point as to what the difference is between Data Science and Stats in the first place... Why major in Data Science when you are doing pretty much all stats anyways??

This might sound superficial, but I want a major that would look good on my job applications as well. So far, Data Science is up and coming, but it isn't like Stats is considered bad. Most people at Berkeley say to take Stats since it is well established, but I have a close friend who works at Salesforce who told me they are impressed/love/interested in seeing Data Science on applications. 

Since both majors are HEAVILY overlapping, I guess it comes down to which one would be considered good in the job market??

Also, I won't have many problems getting into UD classes because I have priority enrollment with a scholarship.

honestly, to all my underclassmen i would like to give you some good advice. avoid relationships in your time here. i wish i could have done the same. as you've just seen, relationships are a waste of time. if you do decide to get into a relationship there are really two outcomes (1) you two find each other compatible and get married and live happily ever after or (2) she dumps you and finds a chad who is taller, richer, and has a bigger D than you. dating is overrated, and so are hookups. focus on studying hard, getting that degree, graduate in 2-3 years, and earn $200k+ offers when you graduate, and then become a multimillionaire by 30. 

then, those chicks that dumped you or gave a pass on you? they'll be begging to come back and suck your D.

I feel like I can definitely handle the coursework for two majors. I made a very tentative four year for all three and it does indeed fit nicely with one summer class, but I don’t know if or how I should choose two. Given that I am quite passionate about all three majors: I want CS because it’s very useful in the future with all the tech stuff in the world, and also because of the starting monies; ORMS because I’ve been obsessed with efficiency since I was a kid and because it’ll help greatly with business management and functions; Business because of haas name flex (if I get in) and so that I can combine With one of the others to move up corporate ladder.

I feel like I can’t handle the coursework for any of the majors. I made a very tentative four year for all three and it does indeed fit nicely with one summer class, but I don’t know if or how I should choose. Given that I am quite apathetic about all three majors: I don’t want CS because it’s extremely difficult in the future with all the tech stuff, and also because of the starting monies which I won’t get; ORMS because I’ve loathed efficiency since I was a kid and because it won’t help at all with business management and functions; Business because of haas name (ew) and so that I can cry about not choosing one of the others when I’m at the bottom of the corporate ladder.

At first, I thought it was a class that was difficult or not taught very well (I never want to pin the blame for difficulty/my own underperformance fully on an instructor but I feel like Acland makes concepts very confusing and explains things in a very roundabout way). I also feel like the Varian textbook is hugely unhelpful also. 

I did okay on the first midterm with an A- and kind of just chugged along for the second midterm's material, but recently I've been concerned about my understanding of the concepts, especially after I (very likely) did average/below average on the second midterm. 

For example, for this week's problem set, there was this one part that literally didn't make sense to me at all, even after checking over Piazza, the notes, and the book. 

I *could* just go to the SLC or office hours but I'm not sure if being told the answers/given hints is the best way to learn--ideally I'd like to be able to get the problem set ~80% correct without any outside guidance. 

I guess I wanted to ask if any former students/current students in Acland's class felt the same way (i.e. lost in lectures, confused on problem sets, but able to understand *some* of the content after studying it closely) and whether or not feeling lost/struggling in 100A means further trouble in economics upper division classes down the road."

The thing with Chem 1AL is that the waitlist filled up so I didn't even get on that. I wanted to take Chem 1A this fall semester but I didn't because of my place on the waitlist. 

If I don't get into Chem 1AL, it'll back up my plans for the next few semesters. I'm an environmental science major with a plan to double major in molecular environmental biology.

I'm having a bit of trouble deciding my courses for next semester and I basically boiled my choices down to the options above. I know that 170's enrollment is still closed, but from everyone I've asked, there's a pretty high likelihood it will be offered. In that case, which of the combinations above do you feel is the relatively easiest one to take? 

 

With regards to my personal background to provide a bit of context, I'm currently taking 70 and enjoying both parts of it quite a lot (I just generally love math/stat related stuff) and my highest workload was spring last semester where I took 61B + EE 16B + Math 1B + R&amp;C Writing + 2 unit IMT DeCal. I found the workload quite easy and did pretty well in those classes but I'm not sure how that translates to the workload for the upper div courses since these will be my introductory UDs. 

 

I'm currently enrolled in 126 and 53 so I will have to phase 2 61c and/or 170 regardless of the combination I end up picking so that might be worth keeping in mind I guess.

 

Another thing is that I would prefer to take 126 with Ramchandran next semester and 61c with Garcia in Fall but I'm willing to give up that preference if a different workload is considered easier. 

 

I'd really appreciate any help I can get with this. Thank you so much in advance!"

Give it a try and let me know what you think. Ideally we should have a lot of event in there but you likely to see nothing because I just launch this :)

So recently, a classmate posted on Piazza basically saying that s/he wanted to work with people that were great at \[X subject\] because s/he had gotten 90+ on a midterm where the fucking \*seventieth percentile\* was in the low 50's. That literally means that literally fucking 70% of people did worse than a 51% or so.  70% or above on the exam was an A-plus. 

What annoyed me even more about this was their use of their happy faces, which they placed next to ""I wrote this anonymously because I don't want others to know who I am/what my grade was :)""

What I wanted to know was: am I just a petty piece of shit for getting triggered every time I come across this post on Piazza (as I scroll down to read answers to older questions?) Would anyone else have gotten triggered over this message? 

Should I just channel my energy into studying for a quiz in this class tomorrow out of spite?

Personally, I got a 65% or so and scored in the A- range (obviously not as good as someone who got a 90% or higher) so it's not like I'm on the opposite spectrum (i.e. failing the course). But I felt like they were just trying to flex their magnum dong about how amazingly they did on a difficult, lengthy midterm and not really trying to ask for group partners.

 Or sure, maybe they really did need a group, but there wasn't a need to be all like ""hey y'all I got a 90% on that difficult test so I will only work with people who got a 90% or better too!"""

According to various online stats, the majority ethnicity at each campus differs. The list below cites the majority ethnicity at each campus:

[**UC Riverside: Hispanic**](https://www.ucr.edu/about/facts.html)  
[**UC Merced: Hispanic**](http://www.ucmerced.edu/fast-facts)  
[**UC Santa Cruz: White**](http://diversity.ucsc.edu/diversity/images/student_demo_2014.pdf)  
[**UC Santa Barbara: White**](http://bap.ucsb.edu/institutional.research/common.data.set.2014.15.pdf)  
[**UCLA: Asian**](https://www.admission.ucla.edu/campusprofile.htm)  
[**UC San Diego: Asian**](http://studentresearch.ucsd.edu/_files/stats-data/enroll/ugethnic.pdf)  
[**UC Davis: Asian**](https://www.ucdavis.edu/sites/default/files/upload/files/uc-davis-student-profile.pdf)  
[**UC Berkeley: Asian**](http://opa.berkeley.edu/uc-berkeley-fall-enrollment-data)  
[**UC Irvine: Asian**](http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-ln-ucsb-latino-20150127-story.html)

UC Merced publicly prides itself on having a diverse student body and claims it “proudly serves the most ethnically and culturally diverse student body among all University of California campuses,” its website [**states**](http://www.ucmerced.edu/diversity).

UC Merced’s student ethnic demographics [**show**](http://www.ucmerced.edu/fast-facts) Hispanics make up the lion’s share of the student body at 3,022 students – or 48.5 percent.

Asians and Pacific Islanders come in second at 1,485 students, or 23.8 percent (Middle Eastern students are included in the Asian category if they are U.S. residents). White students place third at 795 students, or 12.7 percent.

📷Next up? “Nonresident aliens,” defined as students who are not U.S. citizens — either undocumented students or international students. There are 333 such students enrolled, or 5.3 percent of the student population.

After that comes 299 African-American students, which makes up 4.8 percent of the student body. The rest are listed as either “two or more races” or Native American, and 1 percent “declined to state.”

About 99 percent of the student body is from California, with only 24 students [**listed**](http://www.ucmerced.edu/fast-facts) as coming from out of state or a foreign country. That would leave 309 as undocumented students – more than the African American student population.

“UC Merced welcomes students of all ethnicities and backgrounds, and we are proud of the support that we provide to the highly qualified, UC-eligible first-generation students from our region and elsewhere who often aren’t exposed to higher education opportunities early on,” campus spokesperson James Leonard said in an email to *The College Fix*.

He added “undocumented students represent all ethnicities and nationalities. We often don’t know how they identify, which makes it difficult to compare that category to others.”

[**RELATED: Tired of Racism Claims, UCLA Student Sets Record Straight**](http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/16312/)

UC Merced also has a “Hispanic-serving institution” designation, handed down by the U.S. Department of Education in 2010. That makes the university eligible for a host of funding and grants from the U.S. departments of Education, Agriculture, and Housing and Urban Development. Interestingly, UC Merced does not offer a major in ethnic studies or Chicano/Latino studies.

[**RELATED: Hispanic High School Grads Outpace White Peers in College Enrollment Rates**](http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/13488/)

In some ways, the student population at UC Merced mirrors California’s demographic trends. Gov. Jerry Brown’s office [**reported**](http://www.ebudget.ca.gov/2014-15/pdf/BudgetSummary/FullBudgetSummary.pdf) in 2014 that statewide Hispanic residents surpassed whites, coming in at 39 percent compared to 38.8 percent, respectively. Asian residents come in at 13 percent, followed by Black residents at 5.8 percent. Multi-race was 2.6 percent, then came Pacific Islander and American Indian at 1 percent apiece.

“As the Hispanic population in California continues to grow, the proportions of the other race groups will decline slightly, except for Asian, which through immigration should sustain its proportion of the population over the next five years,” the governor’s office stated.

When asked whether or not certain ethnic groups at UC Merced appear to be underrepresented, Leonard says “it really depends on the context” and that “our distribution of ethnicities is much more similar to that of the San Joaquin Valley than of California as a whole.”

According to the most recent stats available online, white students are not the most represented demographic at at least six other UC campuses as well, but none of the campuses have such a small percentage of Caucasian students as UC Merced except for UC Riverside, which has a white student population of 15.6 percent, according to its [**website**](https://www.ucr.edu/about/facts.html).

Although a B is an ok grade imo, I am very stressed because I am planning to apply to the 5th year CS  Masters programs (so 170 is important for application purposes) and I strongly dislike all the material in 170. Specifically, I get really really bored and stressed out when reading 170 notes/watching lectures. Tbh, I feel like I’m just learning a bunch of theory that I won’t realy use (I know DP/LP/etc are often tested during coding interviews may be tested during interviews, but I still feel like 170 goes way too deep). **I also studied my ass off for both midterms, but still scored \~0.5-1 std below avg.**

I have a late drop form available, should I P/NP, drop the class, or continue taking it? To provide more context, I am currently also taking Data 100 and 61c, and am on track for A’s in those classes. I have also taken 2 other upper divs in prior semesters and received A-/A’s in them.

I called my sister (an EECS grad) for advice, and she is adamant that I should continue with 170 even it hurts my GPA. She also mentioned that theres only a few weeks left so I might as well just finish it. However, I don’t think my sister understands how much I dislike the class and how stressful it will be for me to study for the final. Please anyone have advice?

Yet today, after scouring the crowded terrain of Floor 4 for a place to study (to no avail, I might add), my world was changed forever. 

As I ascended the stairs to Floor 5, I was overcome by a profound sense of purpose. There was a void that needed to be filled, and I would be the one to fill it. Upon exiting the stairway, I noticed a free seat overlooking  Memorail Glade. Almost giving into temptation, I hesitantly approached the bench.  

“BUT NO!” I though to myself, “I can do better than this.” And so I marched Westward towards the realm of the Cubicle-Dwellers, wind in my sails, courage in my heart.

As I rounded the corner toward the Holy Land, I feared defeat. Perhaps the legends were true, perhaps there was no void to be filled, perhaps the Dwellers remained... Passing by the first cubicle, my heart sank further. Occupied. The next four were the same. 

But finally, upon reaching the last cubicle of the lot, I found that the legends were false. “I HAVE ARRIVED!!!” I shouted valiantly, drawing glares from the natives of the Quiet Floor. Marching onward to claim my territory, I slammed my backpack on the ground and put my ass in that sweet, sweet blue leather chair.

What we want to know is...how even is it there? Campus life (tho we're both postdocs), city life, life when you're commuting from a place not so expensive?


We're both coming from so cal, and I've been in Monterey bay for the past 2 years, if that gives you any reference. We also like both the city with fun shit to do, and the outdoors.

Pack is a platform that helps **students match with other students** who are walking to and from similar locations. With an emphasis on night safety, our aim is to ensure that we are all able to partake in academics and extracurriculars late at night and get home safely. 

We have not yet finished development, but we are starting to get the word out. If you place yourself on the waitlist, you will be notified instantly when the platform goes live. The more students that are on the platform, the better it works.

If you have suggestions, critiques, or comments, please do not hesitate to leave them below. Thank you.

I'm a leftist and I don't care for these chuds coming to our campus but we need to learn from what happened when Milo came to our campus and we need to try something different. Personally I reccommend that we ignore them, sending the message that they are irrelevant to us and that we are not going to play into their hands. Going back to what happened in the aftermath of the Milo event, the protest only gave him more publicity, he became more popular , sold more books and made more money. The last thing Ann Coulter needs is our attention, because ultimately a protest at Berkeley is publicity for her and it's exactly what she wants and that is exactly why we shouldn't do it. As for the more alt-right elements of their movement who are bound to show up, they too want us to show up and pick a fight with them. We should not give them the fight they are looking for, it only helps their cause because when they get hurt they get to play the victim. No one wants to punch a nazi more than I do but please believe me when I say it is not good optics for the left. The country at large does not view our violence the same way that they view the violence from the right, they playing field is unequal and the game is rigged against us. Their movement, (the alt-right) like the rest of the country, is predominantly white. When images of injured and bloodied white boys circulate in the media, the people who are these images do not react rationally, they react emotionally: what they see is not a 'nazi' being hurt for being a Nazi, what they see is a white person being hurt for being white. The alt-right knows this and it is exactly what they want to happen so they can push their white victim narrative. 

So please, it is my belief that the best thing we can do is ignore them. No one needs to get hurt or go to jail or die over this. The world doesn't need another Heather Heyer tragedy to happen. They can't hurt anyone if nobody shows up. In all likelihood if they don't have anyone to taunt or goad into a fight then they will get bored and go home. If you are going to protest the event, please please please just keep it non violent and remember that the whole country is watching us. If we repeat the events of the Milo debacle we are only going to produce more bad optics for the University and for the Left. 

Let's try something different this time, lets give them what they really deserve: to be ignored."

I am a student at UC Berkeley and I would like to say a few things to those who need to hear some words of encouragement.  **If you don’t want to read about mental health and some more philosophical lessons, keep scrolling.**

I have struggled with several severe mental illnesses; coming to college I was still in the process of recovering from six years of eating disorders.  At the beginning of sophomore year, I was diagnosed with chronic anxiety and depression with suicidal tendencies and put on antidepressants.  I have done everything awful to myself imaginable: I have self-mutilated, starved myself, purged, you name it.  But coming to Cal has shifted my perspective on the world and my individual happiness in many ways.

1. **No one cares about you** \- I’m not trying to sound mean or harsh here.  At a competitive, underfunded school no teacher will ever reach out and tell you you need help.  No counselor will ever call you into their office to see how you’re doing.  Growing up, I had the resources and a support system (my family) to guide me.  Here, I don’t.  I had reached a point in my life where I knew if I did not do something soon I would not be around much longer.  I was the one who scheduled my therapy, who demanded treatment after I left home.  And in doing so, I want to let people know: *there is no shame in reaching out for help*.  And even if there was, would you trade your life for your pride?
2. **Respect yourself** \- Self care, to me, doesn’t mean face masks and television and shopping.  Self care is doing the things that people who love themselves do.  Self care is showering, eating three meals a day, exercising, and telling yourself that there will be good days and there will be bad days, but the goal of right now is to make sure there will just be *more days*.
3. **Your worth as a human being is based on your** ***character*** **and nothing else** \- As someone who attached body image to worth in the past, this is an especially important point.  Our school is a hotbed for comparison- why aren’t you getting that internship?  Getting that grade?  Why aren’t you enough?  Oftentimes, we forget that we are worth more than any number ever given to us.  I am still worthy of loving myself even if I do not have that GPA or set that curve.  I still need to hustle, grind, and tough it out, but that grade has nothing to do with my worth.

To most “sane” people these things sound obvious.  But we need to hear them, reassure ourselves that we are more than this school tells us we are.  I am in an impacted major, and I get what it’s like to have your mental health be impacted by this stressful environment.

Take care of yourself.  Know yourself.  Treat yourself with respect."

For context, I'm a third-year and I switched majors to cs this semester from an unrelated major. I'm currently taking 61b and 70 and haven't completed anything else for the major besides 61a. I've been looking through the doc with upper div cs classes and I had some questions as I have 3 semesters left to graduate on time.

Within cs, I'm leaning most heavily toward SWE since I've enjoyed doing the projects in 61a/b. Realistically speaking, I know 61b and leetcode can pass for a lot of internships and entry level jobs. The upper divs I’m planning on taking are 161, 168, 186, 188, and 100, a lot of which are less intense and lighter workload. However, I'm trying to plan for the long term because I'm not sure how well my career can progress if I only know the base level needed to stitch some functioning software together. For instance, the prevalence of bootcamps and online resources show that people can learn to code in a relatively short period of time without a degree (I'm also basically trying to do cs in 2 years). I'm thinking along the lines of: What about after my first job? What if I don't enjoy what I'm doing and what to explore other fields within or related to cs? How do I progress from my first job to a fulfilling career?

The classes besides the ones listed above that I'm interested in are 170 and 162, and though they’re recommended the most, I sometimes hear conflicting information about their usefulness in industry depending on who I ask. I’m concerned that the advice I’ve heard of emphasizing the value of practical experience over coursework may be coming from people interested in different jobs, people interested in specific companies, or perhaps just thinking in the short term for the first few jobs. I really don’t know very much about the industry so I kind of have to ask a lot of people. It takes me a while to get math concepts, I’ve only taken 1a/b freshman year, and I’m below average in 70 but within -1 SD at the moment so I’m concerned about my ability to handle classes like 170. I’m working with only 2-3 semesters remaining and taking high workload classes like 16a/b and 61c with everything else, so I’m not sure if it’s possible.

Should I try to take any of those intensive classes or should I just take what’s needed to graduate and be employable? What classes should I take to maximize the rest of my time here? I know I should be more concerned with declaring and finding an internship/job first but I need to think about what classes to take too. Sorry for long post and TIA

TL;DR: should I do 170 and 162 as a third-year that just switched to cs or just take easier classes"

This semester has been really rough for me and I’m not sure if I should complete this semester. I’m struggling a lot with both my health and in academics and I’m genuinely unsure if I can even pass my classes anymore.

I would really like to withdraw from this semester so I don’t end up with Ds or Fs, and so I can focus on improving my health. But it’s a bit late in the semester, so I know that if I withdraw now I wouldn’t be able to come back for the spring semester and I’m not sure if I want that either. I’m in the college of engineering and using my late-drop seems to be a little more complicated as I still need to be enrolled in 2 graded technical classes. I’m also in the process of trying to switch my major within CoE and I don’t know if I’ll be able to do so if my GPA completely tanks. 

This is also my first semester, and so on one hand I want to just push through the rest of this semester, but I don’t know if this will be better or worse for me in the long run. Academically, I’ve had a lot of hiccups that I feel like I can solve in future semesters after learning from my mistakes, especially since everyone says that it only gets harder from me. But my personal health has also been at its worst since I’ve been here due to the strain that schoolwork has been putting on me.

I’m not really sure what my options are, so I’m talking to some advisors soon, but I would love to hear about anyone else’s experiences with withdrawing. My main concern is with financial aid, when I’d be able to come back, and if I could do CC classes on my leave or something. UHS has not been the most helpful for me unfortunately and I haven’t been registered with DSP, but I will be looking more into that as well. Thanks everyone :)"

She has had no faith in Berkeley nightlife since then and I wanted to change that. Problem is, I actually live in SF and don’t know all that much about the Berkeley nightlife.

A student housing group associated with the University of California, Berkeley, is staying silent regarding questions about its nonwhite “Person of Color” student housing, a facility that one official said is “not meant” for non-minority students.

The Berkeley Student Cooperative’s Person of Color House was opened in the fall of 2016 with the goal of “increas\[ing\] inclusivity for low-income students and students of color,” according to [**a report**](http://www.dailycal.org/2016/03/04/reclaiming-a-safe-space/) in *The Daily Californian* at the time.

The housing option was created as part of an effort at “creating a safer, more inclusive space for historically and presently marginalized low-income students of color and those from multicultural backgrounds,” according to [**the cooperative’s website**](https://www.bsc.coop/index.php/housing/houses/medium-houses/pocth-castro). The housing is equipped with 56 bed spaces and is wheelchair accessible.

So throughout high school, I was super passionate about music. I was heavily involved in the music program, being in my schools orchestra, marching band, jazz ensemble, and even choir. But I also focused and did well in academics. I strongly considered a music performance major, and either going down the music performance route or being a music teacher. I play violin, marching percussion (like marching snare), and electric guitar. But I caved to the pressures of my Asian parents who made it clear they were not okay with me pursuing music and I should pursue a more lucrative and practical profession, like CS. So I focused on that, and got into Berkeley.

I've been at Cal for 2.5 years now, and I'm doing kinda well academically while pursuing my CS classes. However, I genuinely hate it. Music is my true passion and what I love, and it would make me happy to drop out and pursue music full-time. I want to be a guitarist doing jazz stuff mostly, and hilariously enough, I wish I attended Berklee school of music on the east coast over Berkeley. 

However, I know quitting college and trying to make it as a musician is reckless financially, and a lot of aspiring musicians, even super talented ones, make ends meat by driving uber and lyft, doing retail jobs, etc. And if I tough it out in CS, and get the degree, I could have a CS job, even though I hate it so much, as a backup that pays pretty well and devote my entire free time to music and making that work, and I could work part-time in CS too to get some dough while trying to get an avenue into music. It's just I love music so much and hate academics and school despite being competent at academics and caved into Asian culture/parent pressures, but you need to put food on the table somehow. 

Any advice you guys would be great! And I know I'm just venting. Appreciate it :)"

I saw a poor girl try to sit on the barricade and people started to accuse her of trying to go to the Ann Coulter event, and of being a nazi. They were chasing her around screaming all kinds of things at her. She was very shooken up and buried her head in her phone to text her friends to help.  When her friends came to the rescue, they were obviously other protests, and some of them were men and women of color. They all hugged her and walked away. I scanned the crowd to see their reaction, and see if there was any remorse. Most people just turned away after, and only a couple people seemed to have any remorse on their face. No one apologized though, and a couple people even doubled down by saying ""*wow* I didn't know *they* could show compassion""

Another embarrassing thing I witnessed was a man grabbing a megaphone to scream at the crowd ""you all *MURDERED* my people and took our land! Think about that when you're stuffing your faces with turkey next week. Fuck all of you murderers! Everyone here at this school is complicit with the murder of my people and theft of their land"" and everyone in the crowd cheered while he continued to call them murderers.

One last one: there was a black man that was trying to get into the event and everyone obviously were yelling at him. However, what bothered me is that they were calling him a race traitor, or saying that because he's black he shouldn't be conservative or whatever. They were calling him a clown, etc. Isn't it fucked up that if your skin is darker people will specifically mention that when arguing with you? I'd hate if someone were to tell me that I should think one way or another politically because of my race.

I've never been to a protest before but that was an embarrassing spectacle imo. Good job on giving the person you all seem to hate so much the attention they want."

Regardless of whether you’re on the right or left, you should be conscious of this as a Cal student.

Peaceful protest is respectable, but these groups are incapable of that and their respective histories speak for themselves. I don’t care who’s coming to campus - if they’re coming to speak at a public institution they should be allowed to speak without such impediments. Sure, if a speaker has said reprehensible things, then educate people with reason. When you engage with violence and force then you automatically lose all respect amongst the rational, reasonable person whom you are trying to educate.

As Cal students, we should be actively speaking out against these types of groups and let them know that they are not welcome here, whether right or left wing, since we have to foot the bill in the end."

Because of this, would it be a good idea to take Math54 and EE16b concurrently next semester, or is it just a waste of a class?

Instead of that option, would perhaps taking Math110 in my sophomore or junior year be perhaps a better idea? Can EE16AB satisfy the Math 54 prerequisite for this class?

I was physically threatened, shoved, and verbally abused while punches flew by inches away from my face. 

I realize that this, in comparison with the dozens of unopened Nixle alerts with scary titles in my inbox, is as tame as it gets, but I really had believed that walking with a group of people on Game Day at 8 in the morning should have prevented this from happening, especially because I've definitely taken riskier walks alone.

Who would just randomly cross the street and proceed to shove and shout at random busy people walking by, carrying boxes and other equipment? Is it because we somehow offended you by \*daring\* to walk down Telegraph as the shortest route to our destination on campus?

I sympathize with those who are less unfortunate than I am, but \*\*victimhood doesn't give you the excuse to be an asshole\*\*, and definitely not somehow justify violently lashing-out towards others. 

How do you deal with someone who clearly is not reasonable and is actively threatening you? Do you try to talk them down? Do you stand up for your friends when they are shoved around? What do you do in those tense minutes after you contact the UCPD? What do you do when all of these tactics don't work?

I'm just confused and honestly angry that I was powerless in resolving a situation that really shouldn't have happened at all. I feel disgusted by the fact that all I could do was stand by while he went off on ""you asians"" and how the police can't even touch him.

I'm going to go take a shower and wash his spit off my face.

My price limit for monthly rent is probably about $1200, and from the research I've conducted, it appears that the cheapest studio units in Berkeley go for a bare minimum of $1500. And the studio units that go for $1500 tend to have at least a dozen other applicants. The last studio that I inquired into had 18 candidates, and the landlord was systematically interviewing each one to determine who was the most viable. 

Does anyone have any insider tips on finding studio units? Also, I am open to the possibility of renting a studio in a cheaper area surrounding Berkeley. I am not immensely familiar with its surrounding terrain, but I suspect there must be little towns and suburbs within decent proximity. I've never even been in California before, so I am completely clueless. 

Are there any Berkeley-adjacent towns or provinces or suburbs that would offer a better chance of finding affordable housing in a safe area?"

Explanation:

Roommate is a massive asshole who always says and does things that make me feel like utter garbage. Super super moody except when high, and usualy one second she'll be normal and the next she'll be jabbing at my insecurities. Been taking hits from the passive aggressive insults and hearing from a mutual friend that she always texts about how annoying she thinks I am (even though I now basically never speak directly to her anymore for the exact fear of her shitting on me again). 

We also are in the same friend group lso kinda minor so I'm always inviting her and our entire friend group to parties, smoking, etc. But she often (not always) leaves me out.

Woke up this morning, went to a meeting, joined them for lunch. As soon as I sat down she stood up, threw me a passive aggressive comment, and left. Few minutes later a mutual friends texts me saying that my roommate just invited the other people in our friend group to hang out but not me.

Note that I'm not being a sensitive bitch because I usually don't care what random people say, but her being in my friend group and being my roommate makes it worse. It also isn't just me. 2 other mutual friends (actually our 2 ex-roommates) both noticed and talked about how moody she is and how she hurts feelings and never apologizes and doesn't communicate.

So basically I'm tired of tiptoeing around her and I just want to not be judged so I am planning to sleep in Moffitt tonight."

He said he worked at Cafe 3, Foothill, Crossroads, and Strada all at the same time, apparently, and asked whether I'd be down to go to an ATM near the 7-11 to give him some money.

I unfortunately gave him some money because I've had bad experiences with panhandlers before when I refused to give them money or attention, but yeah, it seems like a scam because many other people have had the same experience (I even saw him trying to get money out of someone else firsthand walking home).

So yeah, please be vigilant of him and if someone could get a shot of his license plate next time, please do.

So I took Math 1A for P/NP because I wasn't doing that great and I was originally taking it as a pre-med requirement. Then spring semester I took Math 16B and got an A. Fast Forward to the summer before junior year I took the equivalent of Math 1B at a community college and got a B. I needed it because I wanted to do MCB as my major and they don't take 16B, so I took it. I also took Math 54 for a grade, and I now have the necessary Math credits to complete MCB.

Now I email the advisor to a grad program I'm interested in at UC Davis. She told me they accepted the Math 16 series at Berkeley. I told her my situation and he said not taking Math 1A for a letter grade ""may hurt my chances""  but providing proof that I took Calculus AB in high school and taking the AP test may ""help."" I asked about retaking a class for a grade in the form Math 16A, and she said that would be the best thing to do but she said she wasn't sure if Cal would allow me to do that (especially after getting a P in Math 1a). 

Today, I just ""enrolled"" myself in Math 16A and it went through the system somehow. What does it mean if I end up getting a letter grade in Math 16A even if ""**Credit Restrictions:** Students will receive no credit for 16A after taking 1A."" Will the letter grade still appear on my transcript and GPA? Just wondering."

My cognitive functions are incredibly low,  my anxiety and depression, the reason for my medication, are at an all time high. I’m not super behind in my reading and homework and can’t even begin to consider taking a final. One of my GSIs told me to consider the hw deadlines as just suggestions, but I’m starting to think there’s no way I can be successful this semester. The last week has been a really big blur, I don’t remember most of it, it takes me significantly longer to process things.

The security monitor was at the desk and when we checked in, she let us know that she had to notify the RA that one of us was intoxicated. We went up to our room, and the RA was there waiting for us. This RA in particular has had a past of giving students a hard time and excessively writing up people for minor violations. The RA asked for our IDs, asked my roommate if he was fine, and then left. I didn't think much of it until today, where I received a conduct violation letter, for which I was written up for alcohol consumption, violating policies while under the influence of alcohol, failure to comply with an RA, and for being a threat to health and safety to others in the dorm. Keep in mind that I was sober the whole night and exhibited no behavior that would persuade the RA to believe that I was intoxicated.

I usually study in my room but because of her bringing her bf over and talking(her desk is right next to mine) I haven’t been able to stay in my room bc I feel very uncomfortable with guests being at my room+cannot focus on my studies.

Instead of applying to L&amp;S under ""Intending a major in Business Administration in the Haas School of Business"", I will need to switch it to ""Global Management Program (Haas School of Business)"" within L&amp;S.

If I am not admitted to the program, will I still be considered for admission to Berkeley? I understand that incoming freshmen are admitted to L&amp;S undeclared, but does denial from GMP lead to an outright rejection from L&amp;S?

For instance, students not accepted to the MET program are still considered for their engineering program, and I was wondering whether L&amp;S and GMP had a similar system in place.

I totally get that we are all different and I think I'm past that stage where I compare myself to others smarter than me and feel inferior and whatnot. I try to put as much effort as possible with given time, but I find myself just playing catch-up most of the time now. 

I was able to complete the first two projects, but I wasn't able to complete Tablut even if I started on it fairly early, mainly due to how slow I was at making progress.

I'm currently studying applied math at michigan, doing [this](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/major-and-minor-programs/mathematics-of-finance-and-risk-management.html) major. I've looked at berkeley applied math major cluster groupings and there doesn't seem to be anything similar (I'm interested in operations research so there is something there I like lol).

Just wondering if there are any courses that looks similar to what I linked? We have a course on things like derivatives pricing, portfolio theory, Black-Scholes Analysis, which is sort of the basic financial math course. Is there something similar at berkeley? It looks like the IEOR cluster might be closest.

The relevant courses on [this](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/undergraduate-math-courses/400-level-courses.html) page are math 423 and 472, on [this](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/undergraduate-math-courses/500-level-math-courses.html) page they are math 525 and 526. If you would like to see syllabi for the courses I can find some old ones.

I saw there is the masters of financial engineering, but it doesn't look like those classes can be taken by undergrads.

Absolutely would not be a deal breaker for transferring if there wasn't anything similar (in state tuition&gt;all), just curious."

&amp;#x200B;

Only 2 blocks from Berkeley Public Library. A lot of able-bodied adults who could find a job if they wanted to just keep coming there for food and shower, and spend the rest of the day in the library. People who get food stamps scam the system. One guy goes to Berkeley Target, only few blocks from campus, and buys something for food stamps. Then he immediately turns around and returns that. Target refunds in cash, and he uses this cash to buy drugs. Is it allowed for a store to return cash for purchases made with food stamps?

&amp;#x200B;

Other people made a deal some store nearby that the store buys food stamps from them for 50% of the value, and then they buy drugs for that money.

&amp;#x200B;

One totally healthy 33 y.o. guy camps in Richmond every day behind somebody's house and comes to shelter to eat every day. He could have found a job, but why would he do that if he can just live off of the system like this?

&amp;#x200B;

Then  there are illegal aliens who hang out in the shelter almost every day. They probably get food stamps too. One of them has the name Arthuro, a 35 y.o. from Mexico.

I'm not sure if I'm at risk of failing the class by not doing these assignments, but even if I did fail, what's the worst that would happen? I'm already far above the credit requirement, and as far as I know, pass no pass classes don't affect your GPA.

This could be in terms of anything: academically, socially, professionally, romantically, etc etc.  

Personally for me, I think my peak is (and always will be) second semester of freshman year.  Granted, I'm only a sophomore, but I think nothing will compare to my second semester because not only did I establish an amazing friend circle and was already acclimated to to the onslaught of academic rigor from the preceding semester, but the dorm environment allowed me to have access to an infinite number of on the fly social interactions and impromptu hangouts/adventures -- many of which will live on to be some of my most memorable times here.  

Even though I still have an amazing social circle its much harder to initiate social events and ""get in the groove"" of going on adventures since everyone lives all over the place.  

Moving out of the dorms really made me realize what a privilege I had last year and the large gaping void that's now in my life. As a result, I'm making joining extracurriculars/clubs my number one priority next semester.  

So far, this current semester is my worst semester here. Academically I've fallen into a huge slump (can't get motivated for shit) and its way less social.  I'm dying to press that reset button in ~3 weeks.

We've considered emphasizing prestige markers (things like Haas sponsorship, names like Berkeley Consulting @ B, industry partners, etc.) to attract ambitious people, de-emphasizing prestige to avoid prestige-whores, requiring more social events to improve bonding, dropping social events to reduce time commitment, rebranding our social media to look more fun, rebranding to look more academic and serious, and more.

People who quit usually say they like the org but need to focus on classes. Berkeley is definitely hard, but lots of students make time for orgs on top of school. We're interested to learn about what has or hasn't worked for other people.

This is particularly tricky because we want to improve the diversity of experience within our org, such as by targeting junior transfers, targeting less popular majors, or dropping resumes from our interview process to focus on short answers and personality, but are worried about hurting retention efforts in the process."

Why do they do this? There are soooo many innocent freshman tweaking hard over their grade and where they stand in the class.

So I'm in CS61A rn and I will gladly say that I have learned a lot of material. Its super challenging at times but I push through. However, I've struggled with anxiety over my latter high school years and its only gotten worse at Cal thus far. This anxiety manifested itself on the midterms, but I was able to get around it on the first midterm and do decently well (above average) and was happy with my score. 

However, I did remarkably horrendous on my second midterm and had a panic attack during the exam, causing me to falter and take the biggest L of my life. I was so ashamed, I sat in the back corner of the lecture hall for the next two weeks just because I didn't feel worthy to even sit near other students. 

I've been doing the math and im really scared that if I don't perform well on the final I will end up with a B. 

This has lead to constant cycles of self-deprecation, doubt, and worst of all: depression. Ive been through peaks and valleys and right now ive never found myself more stressed and sad about myself. I'm so freaking scared bc if I can't even solidly get through CS61A, can I even get through 61b and 70? Should I just give up? 

 talking to certain people and hearing firsthand how some classify CS rejects and subjugate people who struggle makes me feel bad and I honestly feel like those ppl may be right that Im just some loser who tricked his way into cal and I don't think i deserve to be at Berkeley.

I've heard I have to take CS 70 to transfer into CS. This is fine by me because I'm currently in Stat 134, so I know a lot of probability. Also I'm probably gonna take EE 126 next semester so I'll know way more probability. Also I need a B in 70 to declare which is apparently below the mean. Long story short I'm not *that* worried. 

I'm wondering if anyone else has been in this situation. Or, if anyone can give insight on what it's like to take a class but ""not receive credit"" for it. 

On that note, would you recommend taking EE 126 and CS 70 (and another CS upper div) at the same time, just so by the time I get to the probability part of 70 I'll get an A on it because it'll be so easy to me? 

I really wanna take EE 126 next sem bc I love the content. I just don't wanna overload my schedule, end up failing 70, and then suddenly I'm no longer a declared CS major."

Hello,

I am writing to educators, academics, and academic institutions to encourage the adoption of a course of study related to the issue of “ufos” (the most commonly used term though the United Stated government and many others today prefer the term “unidentified aerial phenomenon” or “uap”).

Despite the “breaking news” on this subject since the NY Times report of December 2017 (when they identified a Pentagon UFO study program and released Navy pilot film), signs of a continued avoidance to addressing this subject remain.

Nevertheless, there are beginning signs of a growing recognition of the need to address this, no matter where this leads. In September 2019, Politico’s Bryan Bender noted an interesting statement by the Ranking Member of the House Homeland Security Committee, Matk Walker (R-NC). Walker had been making inquiries in a partially frustrated attempt to determine whether the Chinese or Russians have made an extraordinary and dramatic leap in technology. It appears he may be realizing something else may be happening:

“In a recent interview, Walker, a former pastor, also acknowledged that he is open to the possibility that there are no easy explanations—or the answers could change how humanity perceives the known universe.”

Since preparing a course of study for a long-ignored subject may be a difficult and confusing process at the start, I want to identify a resource that can serve as a good starting point for that:

THE UFO ENCYCLOPEDIA, 3rd Edition, Two Volumes, edited by Jerome Clark. (Make sure you get the 2018 released 3rd edition; published by OMNIGRAPHICS.)

There are very limited UFO courses in a very small number of academic institutions; these may serve as helpful models.

There are also a few expensive online UFO courses of study.

Since I have had 50 plus years of intermittently engaging in a concentrated study of the subject, I began in late May 2019 to write educational content for different aspects of this subject:

http://cosmic-pluralism-studies.academy

As stated there, the material can be freely adopted, or utilized in any way, without attribution.

Finally, it would be great to see academic institutions as a safe refuge for encounter experiencers to relate their experiences in a setting that adheres to strict standards in research, something often lacking in the uncredentialed arena of ufology.

Thankyou for considering this.

Now, paying \~$1500/month for a triple just seems way too expensive. Additionally, how would cancelling the contract affect my financial aid? For those of you living off-campus, do you receive financial aid for off-campus housing? And how is it distributed? By check, to a bank account?

Finally, if it is ridiculously difficult/not worth it to cancel my contract, when should I start looking for next Fall semester's housing? I've heard that I should start looking now, but I don't really see any options for next year yet."

Neither of us meant anything said in the video and we deeply regret even recording that video in the first place.

TLDR at end. 

————————————————

Please comment on the strengths and weaknesses of the instructor in classroom presentation and provide suggestions, if any, for improvement.

In every conceivable way Mr. Rasmussen failed to conduct lecture in an academic and thorough manner. The “lecture” portion of the course (I use quotation marks here because the Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a lecture as a “discourse given...especially for education”, and Mr. Rasmussen’s “lectures” certainly did not match this definition) consisted of the same reused slides throughout the entirety of the course - I sincerely do not mean any exaggeration here, any surface examination of his slide decks on bCourses would corroborate my statement. I perceived his slides as serving the purpose of vaguely defining the trajectory of the course, rather than serving the purpose of instruction. As an example, Mr. Rasmussen failed to define or illustrate a “KPI”, and when a “gate” on KPIs for our project (effectively a midterm) was due, my team was left scrambling to figure out what that was - from an education perspective, this is unacceptable. I am an English major, so I understand to some degree the format of subjective instruction, especially in the context of an argument, but not one of Mr. Rasmussen’s “lectures” gave any direction to my team on how we should conduct our project. When I expressed my concerns about the lack of quantitative instruction, my comments were negated with the response “we are trying to simulate the uncertainty of start-up culture” - while in other circles this may be a valid mode of instruction, in an academic lecture setting, the failure to direct students on the subject matter of the course was completely abominable and fails the most basic of criteria for an effective “lecture”. 

What is your opinion of the instructor's effectiveness in interacting with students? Any suggestions for improvement?

Our weekly 2 hour section was formatted for each group to present on their projects. While Mr. Rasmussen did provide some surface level feed back on our projects, 2/3rds of my time was purely wasted while other groups presented. It got so bland that Mr. Rasmussen eventually let students leave as soon as they were done presenting, as his comments for other groups was simply not useful to our project. Moreover, Mr. Rasmussen did not have office hours, and he was only present as a lecturer around half of the time. His email communication was vague, and even soliciting a response to a due date was a monumental task. After Mr. Rasmussen returned from one of his trips (the reason for him not attending class), he would spend the first 20 minutes of class talking about things like “the gorgeous beaches of Brazil” and how he met a bunch of famous people. These comments made his “lecture” style almost bragging, and demonstrated a complete disregard for the students’ time and eagerness to learn. Moreover, these trips, from what I gathered, were not in any relation to his work with the university. I have had Professors miss lecture because they have had to give a talk on their book, but missing lecture (and failing to communicate with your students) for an external venture? How is that fair at all to me as a tuition paying student? His lack of interaction with students and failure to invest in our education truly made me loose faith in the University of California Berkeley as an academic institution. 

Please give your opinions on the nature and quality of the exams and assignments/projects

Projects were incredibly vaguely defined. I am a Math and English major, so I understand the nature of subjective feedback (ex. The process of grading essays), however, Mr. Rasmussen presented no desire to define what he wanted from our presentations. Interestingly, the lecturer of the main course, Professor Ken Singer, attended one of my group’s presentations, and he absolutely loved it. I remember him commenting that we should take this project out of the university, as there would be plenty of money to be made selling our project back to the university. My group was incredibly ecstatic with Professor Singer’s enthusiasm for our project, but much less enthusiastic with the B- we got on our presentation from Mr. Rasmussen for being “non grabbing” and “not clearly defining our objectives”. Moreover, even in the few instances when we got concrete feedback, to be blunt, I felt cheated, as something like a good “KPI”, “finance plan”, or “road map” was never once defined (even externally through a reading)! No expectations were outlined for projects before hand, and even though we could resubmit projects for a grade, the comments we had to work off of were so very vague - I implore anyone interested in the academic integrity of the University to examine his feedback and determine if anything more than “I didn’t like it” can be discerned. Moreover, when a winner for the “Colider Cup” (effectively a designation of “best project” was given), before announcing the winner, Mr. Rasmussen said “the winner was not chosen based on presentational ability not project merit”, rather it was chosen based on “what project he thought would compete the best” - is this not a long winded way of saying he chose the winner based on his own personal biases? How is that fair to me as an academic student? Is this not a slippery slope into grading based on personal biases that Cal has so diligently tried to avoid?

Please provide additional comments or suggestions about the instructor

If you want a “lecturer” that serves as a medium for education, I could not recommend a professor less than Mr. Rasmussen. Taking his course has made me loose faith in the Industrial Engineering and Operations Research Department’s standards for hiring quality professors. As a recap, his ineffectiveness as a lecturer stems from (i) his lack of attendance, (ii) his lack of communication, (iii) his failure to reflect topics goals in instruction, (iv) his vaguely defined grading procedures, and (v) his lack of regard for the educational process (that being in the most basic sense, serving as a conduit between his own knowledge and the knowledge of the student). As a final point, since when does the University not require a syllabus for a class? The lack of a syllabus was taken as a point of pride in this course - to me, this seemed like a hand waved excuse to define grades arbitrarily - a function I see as serving no other purpose than solidifying the superiority complex of the instructor - a complex, that as research from Berkekey itself shows is non-conducive to a learning environment.

2. Do work study employers let you off for spring breaks? Would I have considerable flexibility on when I work? (Assuming I work in a library)
3. Do I need my social security card etc. to apply?

These may seem like dumb questions, but I would greatly appreciate if any of you can help a freshman out. Thanks!"

For his punishment - as far as I'm aware he didn't do anything illegal, such as make any threats to anyone or call for bodily harm. Therefore any punishment the school takes would be for the social implications as well as the morality of his actions \*. It seems to me that it's a slippery slope, for the school to expel someone for speech that is not illegal \*\*. Right now the school could get away with it simply because it is such a radical view, however, I simply don't think that the school has any business censoring speech and handing out punishments for speech that is legal. Additionally, I think it is important to note that he said what he said was not in public but in private and inside what could be considered his home \*\*\*.

\*(as far as I know, someone correct me if im wrong)

\*\*(even though it is wrong)

\*\*\*(as far as I know, someone correct me if im wrong, additionally does the privacy aspect change the situation from a legal standpoint)

What is your guys take on what I said above?

I was told that a person will have to verify my dorm situation and see if I am eligible to get my port activated. So a person came in and inspected everything and said that my port will be activated. A week past nothing happens and a few weeks later I called again and made a ticket on SAIT helpdesk. I had to wait a week for an appointment for someone to simply walk in the dorm and verify that I am eligible(this took 3-4 minutes). So again I am eligible, but apparently I need to make an appointment with the engineering team to come in and activate the port in person. It's been 2-3 weeks now, there's no response at all to my ticket. There's no ""engineering"" team that reached out to me and no more response from the SAIT helpdesk.

But the stuff I am reading on twitter is absolute garbage. There are people out there calling for violence and honestly, that is much worse than the comments he made. And going off the fact that many people on twitter are citing this subreddit, I want to let you know that I know you're reading this: Shame on you. The kid is 16 ffs. Yes, it was detestable and egregious and he should have known better; but that doesn't warrant some of the terrible things being said about him that are putting his safety in jeopardy.

He made a terrible mistake. It happens. However, I certainly don't want to see the kid's life be affected forever because of it. He's obviously gifted academically but lacked the maturity to realize how stupid he was being. We all make mistakes. He was drunk and it was a dare: just a couple of freshman knuckleheads trying to be edgy. Haven’t you ever been drunk and did something dumb? Yes he should be taught a lesson, but for people to call for violence? That's total crap. I feel bad for this kid: he has such a bright future ahead of him and now he will have this hanging over his head forever. I say give the kid a break. He said some awful things but I highly doubt he meant any of it. Just watch the video again: it was clearly staged and the whole thing was obviously contrived to fulfill whatever stupid bet these kids had going. 

Like others mentioned in a couple of threads, Obama talked about this phenomenon recently where merely trying to 'cancel' someone isn't akin to real activism or contributing to or effecting real change. This is a very apt example. And meeting hate with hate isn't going to get us anywhere. 

I bet if you met this young man, you'd see that he's not actually the monster people are painting him out to be. He deserves a second chance. Perhaps he should be kicked out of Blackwell, but as a student, he should be allowed to study without any threat to his physical well-being. This just my take on it. You don't have to agree.

All the people on Twitter and overheard talking about “I fear for my safety” or “this is traumatizing” needs to grow the fuck up. Adolf Hitler is not speaking on campus. There are no death squads walking around killing minorities. All the happened was that some sixteen year old kid got recorded talking like he would into Xbox live. He needs to be brought to the real world. Not shunned from it. If my conversations with friends at 16 got published, fuck I would be absolutely annihilated by everyone.

Now the UC system, by its sheer size and influence as the nation’s premier public research university, is again poised to play an outsize role in the future of standardized testing in America as its leaders consider whether to drop both the SAT and ACT as an admissions requirement.

Although the standardized tests are predictive of college performance, particularly at selective universities, they are increasingly seen as an unfair admission barrier to students who don’t test well or don’t have the means to access or pay for pricey test preparation. Decades of research has shown that scores are strongly influenced by family income, parents’ education and race.

The looming question is how UC officials will move to address the clearly documented flaws of the test. If they choose to throw out the SAT and the ACT, another popular test, will they find a better replacement? …

UC regents are not expected to make a decision until next year. But an extraordinary and unscripted exchange about 2 hours and 25 minutes into a recent meeting revealed the enormous stakes, deep passions and growing impatience surrounding the issue.

### ""States of Exceptionalism: Politics, Economics, and National Identity in Britain and the United States""

 **Great Britain and the United States of America have deep-seated political, economic, cultural, and historical ties. As well as having both language and law in common, they share an intellectual heritage and distinctive commitment to individual liberty, free-market economics, and limited government. And at pivotal moments in modern history—most notably both World Wars, but also Korea, the Cold War, the Gulf War, and the invasion of Iraq—they have been staunch allies. Yet this “Special Relationship” has also been marked by conflict and difference. Most obviously during the Wars of Independence and 1812, but also in their varying experiences of (and attitudes towards) religion, race, socialism, and imperialism. Curiously, both nations see themselves as “exceptional” even as they continue to articulate their national identities—in part at least—through comparison to the other. This course will examine the similarities and differences between Great Britain and the United States from the early modern period up until the current political, economic and cultural turmoil. It will do so through examining four key aspects of each country: (i) their overall history, including forms of nation-building, key domestic crises, and foreign entanglements; (ii) their politics, including the evolution of their intellectual traditions, political parties, institutions, and laws; (iii) their economic forms of governance, including domestic markets, welfare states, and foreign trade; and (iv) their national identities, including the ways these are articulated through political culture, public education, and their treatment of immigrants and other minorities. We will cover these aspects in turn, looking at each country separately before comparing them, trying to understand their relationships to each other, and thinking about possible ways forward. Approximately half of the class time each week will be spent on lecture, and the other on discussion of the assigned readings and lecture material. Assessment will be via a midterm exam, a final exam, class attendance and participation, and various forms of in-class tasks (including reading quizzes, short presentations, and peer-to-peer work).** 

So far \*4\* people are enrolled, and the seminar is in danger of being canceled. It looks super cool, and I really want to take it (plus I dropped PE 101 for this so now I'm slightly worried). It's also an international breath if anyone needs that? Please take it with me! We need more small classes at Berkeley!

So I have a super average music background. Played piano for a few years as a kid, then started violin and played in an orchestra for around 8 years, until I started college. For the first two years, I set aside all my extracurricular interests to focus on school and whatnot — the usual trajectory. But I’ve always had an itch to play music again, despite my fear that it would only eat up time from other activities. I love listening to music, and I absolutely love attending concerts and performances, anywhere I can hear live music. Specifically, I want to pick up piano again.

As someone who knows almost nothing about the music department here, what are some music classes geared toward intermediate piano players? I have years of piano and general music experience, but since I’m rusty I really want to improve my technique and learn some pieces in an instructional setting. If so, are these classes open in spring 2020, and do you have to audition?

Also, are there any music clubs/student orgs that look for piano players? I would love to meet new people through a shared hobby, since most of the friends I’ve made here have been through classes or professional clubs. Plus, playing in a group is so much more fun than busting some tunes by yourself in the Morrison practice rooms LOL

On a side note, any classes or clubs for introductory jazz? I’ve always been a fan of the genre, got no experience but seems really cool"

3) I know that people in 1st sem sophomore year get FAANG internships and by default they cant be ""CS"" majors yet, coupled with the fact that I've heard that once you get your first internship (as long as you still learn, don't burnout, etc .)  you have secured a strong future in tech, leads me to believe that major name really doesn't matter.

eb7o96,The Mental Health Problem in CS - From CS61B,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/eb7o96/the_mental_health_problem_in_cs_from_cs61b/,KuKluxKitten,1,2019-12-15 16:57:38,119,/r/berkeley/comments/eb7o96/the_mental_health_problem_in_cs_from_cs61b/,NaN,"Directly copy-pasted from CS61B piazza:

&gt; My name is {REDACTED}, and my mental health has deteriorated because of this class. While other confounding factors were of course at play, this class was really the final blow. And I am not the only one who feels this way. 
Let me preface this by Saying 61B was by far the most engaging and useful class I have taken at Cal. I really do wholeheartedly love the content and the projects. However, being able to keep up with this class has quite literally shattered me. This class has one major issue that is really important to me and must be addressed: The stigma around mental health. While I understand that it must be a difficult class just in nature, I really think there needs to be some preemptive steps taken in the future to mitigate the extreme stress that this class causes on its students, whatever that may look like. At the moment, this class is destructive in a way that no other class at Cal is. The statistics in my survey below are a good example of this destruction.
This semester, I took on 61B knowing it would be a difficult class and fully expecting to put everything in. But this class took more from me then I had. From countless sleepless nights, skipped meals, crying, anxiety attacks, stress-induced nausea, and self-deprecating thoughts, I found myself faced with the reality of mental state while being unable to do anything about it. I was stuck between a rock and a hard place, under pressure, and lacking the resources to get the help both mentally and material wise from the course.
I am not the only one who felt this way. In my time working with my peers, I watched as they cried in front of me over their broken code, held them while they had anxiety attacks, and listened to the others tell me that they did not sleep for days or had not eaten. I have friends who forgot their prescribed medications over stress and have breakdowns due to it. I listened to my peers tell me they were too stupid for this school and didn’t deserve their lives -- and they really believed it. And for some students, it was the first time they were experiencing this. Many students needed therapy but refused to seek help/didn’t recognize that they needed help. Many didn’t know how to get help. Others said “There’s no time for therapy when you have a project to finish.”
So, over dead week I decided to take a mental health survey to really get a better understanding of the situation. (Shared with permission) The results are the following. Out of the 65 people who had responded to the anon survey:
On a scale of 1-10, 70% of respondents rated their mental health under 5. 
87% of respondents said their mental health got worse after this class. 
90% of respondents said no other classes affected their mental health as much as this one.
90% of respondents reported skipping meals and losing significant sleep. 
What’s more is that my situation applied to many other students. We shared horrible mental health experiences. Here are just a few of the responses of your fellow students in 61B:
I don't think I would call it an experience anymore, it's become so frequent I think it's just a state of existence. I used to cry every other day because of this class but now I can't feel anything anymore :) I just hope someone is getting a kick out of my misery because I'm not
I had panic attacks and I started going crazy(screaming, anger anxiety etc)
Broke down in Soda twice.
This whole semester I have slept 4-6 hours a day mainly because of this class and it has led me to put off tasks in my other technicals. My self esteem has also gotten a lot lower because I always thought I could do better on the next assignment/project but I end up doing worse.
I was so stressed during enigma that I started hyperventilating and almost passed out. :( worst thing is that I started the project super early and ended up late dropping the class for mental health issues.
Project 0 was a disaster for me. I literally start working on it the day after it came out. I struggled until I was finally passing the given unit tests only to find out these tests were definitely not an indicator of a working board. I worked the entire weekend on the project scared by the prospect that I was probably get a 2 on this project. By Sunday night after getting no sleep, I just couldn't do it anymore. I collapsed in tears and filled out the paperwork to e-drop the class.
Had multiple mental breakdowns, have not slept in own bed in 48 hours, ate twice in that time.
I had to drop this class during dead week because of how stressful it is
The autograder running only in the last 24 hours, especially on days when the project deadline falls on a difficult day (for Gitlet, I was presenting a final deliverable in Vancouver on the deadline day, and was unable to work on my code), really added a significant amount of stress. I lost a lot of sleep over this class, and things like the ""6 hour grace period"" after midnight only exacerbate these kinds of issues. Students are encouraged to lose sleep over projects rather than providing more infrastructure to ensure that they are able to take care of their health simultaneously.
For better or for worse, I have always been confident in my ability to do well in school, to be able to figure any problem I have out. I knew coming into this class that it would be difficult, course staff is always very open about that. But what I was not prepared for was the overwhelming pressure of the projects in the class. I want to be challenged, I would not learn otherwise (and I have learned immensely in this course). What I did not want out of my college experience was cryptic responses to my genuine problems and being brought almost to tears by my project not working. The projects went from being something I wanted to do well on, to something I wanted to finish, no matter what the grade.. Without the support system of my friends in the course, I doubt I would still be an intended CS major. There were so many moments this semester that I wanted to give it all up. Admittedly, I used to be unsympathetic to those who took on anxiety and stress because of their classes, but I understand now the depths to which a class can take you. I consider myself a fairly good programmer, but I don't think anybody can succeed in Computer Science individually. This class asks us to do just that, though, work on everything individually. I never want to experience that kind of isolation again, and hope that this course becomes more supportive of its students because I truly have grown so much as a programmer, but I am sure it was not worth the cost.
I’ve cried multiple times while working on projects in 61B this semester. I’ve also been on the verge of panic attacks many times from the stress of this class. 
I haven't been able to sleep due to the stress caused by this class. Whenever a project deadline was approaching I wouldn't be able to sleep because I was worried about not being able to finish and turn in the project on time. I distinctly remember being on the verge of tears the night the first project was due. It was very traumatizing and frustrating having the feeling that you couldn't find real resources for help during this class with OH being 500 minutes long and TA's and Tutors being sassy/vague/condescending on Piazza. My friends also have shed tears over this class - after tablut, my friend and I literally just hugged and cried together during our team practice because we were just so burnt out and done with the project. 
I haven't completed a single project in this class and allnightered for every one of them. Each time I stayed up for 36 hours or more in a row, causing severe sleep deprivation, dehydration and hunger. After I submitted gitlet I took a shower and some clumps of hair fell out :/
I can't fall asleep sometimes because of how stressed I am about this class. I feel like I'm doing significantly worse than my peers, and like I am not qualified to be a CS major. I don't think I deserve sympathy or help either, because I think other people in this class have it worse and are still doing much better than I am. Somehow I still have it in me to still love coding and enjoy all the projects from 61b in spite of all this, which is why I would love more reciprocation of effort and support from the CS department other than a piece of paper. 
I suffer from anxiety and have only had one previous panic attack during my 4 years attending this school. This course really broke me -- I am in DSP and Data Science major. I began having panic attacks more often and had a panic attack so severe that I had to go to the ER. The only thing that kept me going after that instance is that I have one semester left.
THIS IS NOT NORMAL. YOUR STUDENTS ARE SUFFERING. 
Look, This post is not meant to bash this class. But this problem CANNOT go ignored any longer. There needs to be a solution to a pressing problem, which is more severe than many of us realize. This issue needs attention. My goal was to shine light on the issue, notify course, and also talk to staff about implementing real solutions. More so, it is to remind other students that they are not alone -- we are all in this together. You are not suffering alone, and I hope to change things for those of you who are struggling.  I and a few other students would like to discuss with the CS department/Course Staff the possibility of implementing a mental health dept within CS (like the CoC), having the class provide more resources to students, having a mental health lecture, and structuring a class that puts students and their education first. Literally anything would help. You will find that I have already sent an email to course staff in regards to this situation.  No one else should have to suffer like this for their education. Please help us build solutions to make this class the best it can be. 
___________
Ps- I am aware that I have a small sample size and that not everyone feels this way. And to those of you who are thriving: I am incredibly proud of you. In fact, I did receive some positive feedback on the aforementioned survey. However, the response to my survey was negative enough for me to feel this issue needed to be addressed. Thank you for taking my thoughts into consideration.

Unfortunately, the physician at Tang called an ambulance and I had to spend the next 6 days in the ICU burn ward at Saint Francis Memorial Hospital in SF.  


To make matters worse, I still can’t even write. My hands are shaking so much from the neuropathic pain that everything I write looks like gibberish. The social worker at the ICU wrote emails to Sahai and my other professors, but I don’t know if letting me take the final a few days later would even do much at this point.

I am looking for advice on whether I should drop my two courses with a large written final (Math 53 and EECS16B), do a full blown medical withdrawal, or try to get an incomplete. To be precise, I want to get an incomplete and take the final when I can write again, but I don’t know if my circumstances are severe enough to warrant it.

I fucking hate this school. This semester has pushed me to the breaking point and forced me to become a hard-working individual.

Looking back at 61A, it has pushed me so hard and even though I may not get the grade I want I have learned so much and I'm honestly so excited to learn here. We have learned HOF's, lambda's, recursion, tree recursion, trees, OOP, data abstraction, scheme, tail recursion, macros, streams, SQL, iterators, generators and more stuff I am possibly missing. At the beginning of the semester I went full try hard mode, and did well on my first exam, then got cocky and bombed the second one, I am now going full try hard mode on this final and hopefully do well. Im looking at the intro to CS courses at other schools and it doesn't even compare. My giant has ego has shrunk down and been replaced by a sense of self-accomplishment. I hope I do well on the final and get a B+ (was gunning for an A- but fuck the second midterm), but regardless it has been a hard, challenging, yet fulfilling first semester. Can't wait to come back, go full try-hard mode for all 3 midterms and crush 61B.

1. How is UC Berkeley competing with the top private universities in research and reputation rankings despite having the 10% of the resources that Harvard has?
2. How is University of Michigan, also a public university, so much more wealthier than Berkeley?
3. Who here is willing to donate a few billions (or tens of billions) of dollars so that Berkeley can stay competitive in the future and our degree will not depreciate in value?

I also have some programming experience.

Here's my schedule:

\- CS 61B

\- EECS 16B

\- CS 70

\- MCB 140

\- MCB 100B

\- History 137AC

\- Physics 7C

\- 2 development clubs (10 hr/wk, 6 hr/wk)

\- Part Time Job (16 hr/wk)

\- Genetech internship (25 hr/wk)

I definitely think this is a lot but is there someone out there who did something similar?"

What is the best way for someone who is staying in the area in an ideally furnished place for all of four months? airbnb? Hostel? Housing groups?

TL;DR at bottom

I'm currently a 3rd year CS student, and am trying to come up with my class schedule for next (my final) semester at Berkeley. I am trying to get more experience with AI and have taken 188 this semester. 

I was planning on taking 162 next semester because I have heard it is very important for a Software engineer, but also some people have spoken differently, saying depending on your focus as a Software engineer. I'm trying to decide between 162, and taking 189 with 182 (if that's even possible/recommended). 

From those with work experience, how important is 162? I'm not planning to remain a software engineer for too much of my life (trying to move up to project manager ASAP, as pretentious as that might sound) and am wondering which class combo will give me the best way to reach that path. (I would also be more interested in AI development both for engineering as well as product management)

Thanks in advance!

ecpsbc,WHY is gpa ~so~ important?!?!,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ecpsbc/why_is_gpa_so_important/,rocky_teapot,1,2019-12-18 23:11:39,14,/r/berkeley/comments/ecpsbc/why_is_gpa_so_important/,NaN,"I'm --&gt; TIRED. Can someone please explain to me why there are GPA minimum requirements on applications (internships, jobs, grad school, etc)?? GPAs aren't--or at least they *shouldn't be*\--indicative of mastery, diligence, capability. There are many factors that contribute to one's GPA other than their study habits, but grad schools and the professional world don't seem to understand this? Why? 

I'm an engineering student who didn't come from an engineering/technical background. Engineering seemed cool when I was applying to college, so that's what I went with. My high-school wasn't the best, but I still did relatively ""well."" Coming to Berkeley, though, I've realized just how far behind I am. I'm constantly struggling in most of my classes. I also have a part-time job which takes away from my studies a bit. 

I guess I'm just tired of getting bad grades, and I'm even more tired at the fact that these bad grades continue to shrink the number of opportunities I'll have post-grad. I don't think any engineering program will accept a 2.6 GPA. I'm trying my best to find internships but many of those have a 3.0 minimum GPA as a mandatory qualification. I don't know what to do at this point. Feeling: hopeless \*sad emoji that's looking down pensively\*"

So many people (looking @ you, featured on ucb's ig account) have done such extraordinary things or had so many experiences or hell, were captain of two sports teams and president of three clubs and valedictorian and their school's principle. Obviously I had these people at my high school too, but they weren't the majority. It doesn't feel like I've done much of anything. It's weird having ""normal"" feel so inadequate now.

I know everyone says admissions didn't make a mistake and we deserve to be here, but being fortunate to attend such a great school with such talented people makes me feel that I'm not making the most of it. I test pretty well and I didn't think much about applying or getting into Berkeley (not a brag bc now I feel inadequate and inferior🙃). The whole process even since/in high school feels so disconnected and like I'm just going through the motions and even now the classes and everything feel very passive. Hearing about how people worked so hard to get here makes me feel like I'm wasting my time here by not doing enough or appreciating it enough or because of this passive feeling. Also I'm planning on declaring a arts/humanities major (no shade on the humanities, just personal insecurity) and even though I find my intended major engaging and fulfilling, it also sort of makes me feel like I'm not taking advantage of being at this school. Like I'm interested in my field and I wouldn't want to be a STEM major lol but STEM fields seem more technical and science-y and sometimes makes me feel arts fields aren't the same caliber (THIS IS ONLY @ ME NOT ANY OF YOU ART/HUM MAJORS). I don't know. It's a weird mix of I'm too boring to belong and now that I somehow got in with all of you I'm later going to regret not taking advantage of being here. I don't know exactly what I want to get out of making this post ~~besides procrastinating something I reallllly need to finish by tomorrow~~ but getting it out feels kinda nice nonetheless."

Take one or the other, and pack easy classes on top for stable declaration. Condensing classes increases suffering a lot more than it reduces the duration, and may perhaps haunt you for the rest of your career, given unfamiliarity with both classes.

I poured my heart and soul into the class and really enjoyed it.   However, when the midterms and final came, the amount of studying I did didn't measure up with my scores.  Before coming here, I knew I would have to make up for my lack of natural talent by studying more and I thought I would be able to keep pace with others.  But when I wasn't able to, it was disheartening.   My floormates exceled in the class and it feels like many people around me have so much natural talent.  I did every practice test and studied every resource I could find but many times I coulnd;t solve the problem no matter how much I worked at it.  I know it's not my study habits because I tried different things.  I feel like I learned a lot but when I take an exam or practice exam, I feel incredibly stupid.  Sometimes, it feels like the tests are an IQ test written in porteguese, and the whole point of the class is to learn portuguese to be able to read the questions and just to understand what the test is about and what it's asking.  Are future courses here at berkeley like this?  I was really happy to get into Berkeley and I'm still pretty happy here.  But every now and then I feel like I'm just not smart enough to preform, and I'm really doubting whether I'm cut out for CS.  I feel like I'm just not able to think critically, creatively, or for myself.  Sorry, I guess this isn't really a question but I needed to say this somewhere."

&amp;#x200B;

Twas the night before finals, when all through the chat;

Not a student was sleeping, not even a nap.

The cheat sheets were made on the paper in ink,

In hopes that GPA the next day would not sink.

Sitting for hours, feeling quite dead;

While visions of integrals danced in my head.

Professor at home, and I at my desk,

Thinking the exam will be quite grotesque.

When up in my brain a lonely synapse did fire.

The thought that ensued, it was enough to inspire!

Getting lost in the notion soothed for a time.

I thought giving it heed might not be such a crime…

Like lightning it struck, in my mind it was clear.

I am a Cal student, and I made it here!

I have what it takes, of this I must know.

Looking down my old path, far behind, and below…

All of the pain that I felt, and the tears that I wept,

The nights that I worked, when I could have just slept.

All the rungs that I climbed to get here tonight;

I will not go out now without a hell of a fight.

And let history show that I was not one to quit

When I felt more unworthy than I care to admit.

I have wonderful friends. I know they struggle too.

I just want them to know I believe they’ll get through.

One day we will look back at the struggles of school.

Of how the exams were mean, wicked, and cruel.

But we will probably then, have new burdens to bear.

For a life without burdens is exquisitely rare.

And school will be a flicker, no more no less.

Yet more proof that we are already a success.

I took 16 months off Berkeley via withdrawal for mental health reasons and since coming back my only goal has been to declare CS so it’s a scary day for me.

I’m not even in some horrible position score wise but I have also been steadily declining in my classes this semester. Gone from +0.2 to -0.7 standard dev from cs70 midterm 1 to 2. Also have like an 88% hw avg post curve which will slightly hurt me. 

I only need a B- in 70 to guarantee CS major admission (even if I fuck up 61B final) but my confidence has been steadily declining in the class in spite of a lot of attempted effort and office hours. Since the class is curved w/ correlated exam distributions I don’t even know what type of min standard deviation would boot me below the bucket for a B-, but it feels like it could realistically happen possibly. I don’t know since nothing can really be computed accurately yet.

Good luck to everyone taking CS finals today. I’m (statistically) not even in the most desperate possible position and I’m terrified there’s a real chance I could fuck up and not make it. I really hope it works out.

(By the way, if anyone with a better working knowledge of stats than me has any reasonable idea when accounting for correlation what a very ROUGH estimate would be for the min standard deviation on the final I’d need to maintain a B- or better, please let me know because I’ve driven myself crazy trying to figure it out)"

Has anyone done sage corps over the summer? How was it? Do you think you actually gained professional skills, or was it -- out of a lack of a better word -- bitch work in a different country? 

I'm a little suspicious, not just because I've gotten a bunch of emails from them since freshmen year. 1) There was absolutely no technical screening (I listed software as my #1 choice). The one-way video interview consisted of only 4 behavioral questions. It's kind of sus that a proclaimed ""high quality"" internship would set the bar so low. More importantly, 2) they don't tell you the company or even the ROLE that you're assigned to before you sign the $1000 binding contract. Guys, I'm literally paying a company I want to get a job at. And before you sign the contract, there is NO guarantee that you will be paid or provided a stipend. There is a possibility that I will need to pay for housing, food, transportation, etc. from my own pocket. So this third reason isn't that important but 3) almost all online reviews from past interns are absolutely GLOWING, which kind of screams suspicious to me.

What do yall think?"

Here at Cal, there's this notion that students' professional ambitions negate their compassion and empathy. In other words, people feel that  students here are selfish, consequently resulting in the cutthroat environment that is Cal. However, my latest question regarding my dismissal proves that all wrong. It was enlightening to see such compassion and support from a group of individuals I don't personally know. You are all beautiful people and I appreciate every single one of you. That being said, the outcome of my predicament still scares me. But  whatever happens, I know it is with reason and I am not alone. After evaluating everyone's responses, I realized that life wouldn't throw this obstacle at me if it knew I couldn't handle it, which gives me hope in the sense that I know I can outperform this hurdle.

Bottom line is, what is happening right now will not define your future. I have a friend who is head of data science at a company who never got a high school diploma or a GED. I have other friends who couldn't afford to go to more than a state school who are doing great. 

Yes, doing great at Cal will make things easier in the short term but even if you fail out you can still end up in the same place. It might take more time and a more creative route but I promise you'll be fine and what is happening now will not impact your happiness or success for the rest of your life.

ee0fn1,In Distress: Attention All Pre-Meds,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ee0fn1/in_distress_attention_all_premeds/,ucbthrowa,1,2019-12-21 20:26:52,10,/r/berkeley/comments/ee0fn1/in_distress_attention_all_premeds/,NaN,"Hi, I am a pre-med in need of advice. I am a junior and a pre-med, that initially wanted to take a one year gap year, but that is now considering taking two. I still have to take Chem 3B/L and Bio1A/L and then BioChem, to finish off my requirements for pre-med and I have come to realize that the time in which I finish these, at least for me, will determine when I will begin to prepare for the MCAT.

Pathway #1

I could take Chem 3B/L and Bio 1A/L in the Spring, which I heard that a good amount of people actually do or have taken together, but with a focus on maintaining and slightly increasing my GPA would this be risky? If I took this path, I would take Biochem in the fall, and ideally take my MCAT in the Spring to apply for that coming Summer Application Cycle.

Pathway #2

But then the other option is to take another one of my upper divs with either Chem 3B/L or Bio1A/L, and have a more manageable load, then take the other in the Fall and Biochem in the Spring. In this case, I would study for my MCAT the summer after graduation and take in sometime between August and January, and then apply that following Summer Cycle, and hopefully matriculate in the Fall of 2023.

If it were you in this position which option or track would you take? I think that my worry is that I didn't really plan on the additional gap year, but given my experience and my minor in BioE I think I could land a gig in biotech for sometime to accumulate some money to pay for med school.

What would be the better option? To set myself up to hop right in after a year, or to take time to further build the GPA, and make money and get some additional experience?"

Stat 88 received a complete overhaul this semester with a newly written textbook, and an increase to the unit course load from 2 to 3. Given this, I thought I would give a review on the class from the perspective of someone who had never taken AP stats or had any stats exposure.

Also quick disclaimer: Lucas will be teaching this in Spring 2020 so my experience can and will probably deviate from future class's experiences. Additionally, Adhikari kicked out anyone who was not concurrently enrolled in or had taken Data8 in the past. Also, if you had taken Stat 134/140, she also kicked them out because she said those students would have an unfair advantage and recommended they take other upper div stats courses.

**PEERS:** Anecdotally, I would say a majority of people were pre-haas or cs kids looking to cop a data science major/minor. Also (I'm a transfer), There were also not that many transfer students compared to a class like Stat 20 (which imho, meant tougher competition).

**WORKLOAD:** I would definitely say that the homework and textbook exercises required a pretty considerable time commitment. I'd say pretty much everyone I interacted with in office hours, or before/after lecture hours/discussion peeps I talked to agreed that this should have been a 4 unit class and some kids I talked to also voiced their regret as to not having taken stat 20 instead. And it was kind of hard to justify spending more time on a 3-unit class versus a 4-unit class when obviously the 4-unit class matters more towards our gpa for declaring majors or whatnot --  I'd say this was a pretty big reason in some kids falling behind in material (those taking cs61a/b/etc or other important major-related courses).

**LECTURES:** Honestly, Adhikari lectures -- not much more needs to be said. Though I will say that I knew some kids who stopped/never attended lecture and read the textbook instead and they did perfectly fine.

**TEXTBOOK:** The textbook was written week by week, by Adhikari. Honestly, I was pretty amazed at how thorough and well written the book was for having been written on the fly. Book is really great and definitely did its job. I'm used to math textbooks being useless and resorting to khan academy or w.e., but this book did a really great job.

**QUIZZES AND EXAMS:** Though the homework and textbook exercises were pretty time-consuming, I actually felt like the quizzes and exams were really fair. If you followed along with homework/textbook exercises, you probably did 'ok' at the minimum on these. First midterm had an insanely good performance result because the midterm length was 50 minutes and Adhikari wrote questions to account for time-length. Also there's a clobber policy so the final can replace your midterm grade. Fortunately, I have extreme testing anxiety so I made really dumb mistakes on both.

**GSI/OFFICE HOURS/PIAZZA:** The Course staff was really really outstanding. Plenty of office hours to get help, and they, along with Professor Adhikari were super responsive on Piazza. They were also hiring tutors for next semester, though I did not apply. No criticisms at all about this.

**WOULD I RECOMMEND SOMEONE TO TAKE STAT88?:** Definitely. Though there were times I disliked the workload, I'm so glad to have taken the course and I feel like I'm really prepared for future statistics related courses. I would definitely tell people to not underestimate the course just cause it's 3 units though. Be prepared to keep up with material and homework or you will fall behind because there will be no curve to save you. There's plenty of pre-haas kids who are really grindy for that dank gpa and would be more than grateful to you if you plan on making this class a low priority. Also, this class fulfills the stat requirement for the econ major **AND** can be used for the data science minor, while stat 20 **does not** as far as I know.

**TIPS I HAVE FOR FUTURE STAT88 STUDENTS:** Take advantage of piazza, and don't be afraid to ask questions. Also, it seemed like everyone in the class formed facebook messenger groups and banded together for problem sets and to make study groups so that would be a great idea. This is especially true for those of you who have never had any prior exposure to stats/probability... **READ THE TEXTBOOK**

Anyways overall, I really enjoyed the class and would take it again if I were to go back in time. Feel free to ask any questions if you're curious. This ended up being super rambly, but I really hope y'all don't take this as too whiny and I genuinely hope this class gets the popularity it deserves!"

Hope your time off is going well so far. 

I took 3 graded classes this semester: Psych 101, Econ 100A and Stat 20 with Ibser. While I think my Psych 101 grade might be okay, I am nervous about 100A and Stat 20.

For 100A and Stat 20, it's not really being nervous about declaring economics (need B- and C+ or some combination of 5 GPA points, like a B and C would be okay too, unless of course my grades were worse than that) but more so the damage it would due to my overall GPA. 

I definitely fucked up the 100A final or at least did below average--I was telling everyone that I thought it was worse than both midterms but everyone else seemed to think the final was in between the midterms for difficulty. So there's that--30% of my grade was probably a disaster.

And for Stat 20, while the final wasn't as much of a sucker as that awful midterm, I just honestly had shifted most of my attention to 100A and was just unsure of little things here and there. That final was 50% of our grade. I don't think I *failed* it but I don't think I will like my Stat 20 grade because my final was heavily weighted and wasn't a ""slam dunk"" performance. Moreover, I heard Ibser doesn't post your final on Gradescope or the score on bCourses which heightens my anxiety, as I will literally have to go off how I 
felt about the final. 

I've been in therapy for academic anxiety for a long time and so one strategy I'm trying to apply is thinking of the ""middle"" outcomes, as in ""Okay, I probably didn't get an A or A+ in Econ 100A or Stat 20 but I probably didn't get a C-level grade either, which is enough to declare Econ even if it would hurt my overall GPA."" 

But does anyone have any other tips?"

Hope everyone is having a great holiday season. I am planning on taking 102 next semester and was planning on studying for it during winter break as I've heard this class is the bane of every premed. The teachers teaching next semester are Calendar, Miller, and Ingolia. I found a syllabus on TBP that had Miller and Ingolia so I can see which chapters of the book they cover so I can pre-study them but I can't find any syllabus with Calender in it. Does anyone have one? Also, do you guys have any other tips for pre-studying for this beast of a class?

On a slightly separate note, I am looking to buy a used version of the Study Guide for this class? I am on a massive budget so I was wondering if anyone was selling their used ones?

I'm a prospective transfer student studying English, and while I've been at cc I've come to know some of my profs really well. Especially as I was an in-class tutor for one of my former prof's composition classes, I ended up just hanging out in his office a ton and talking about pretty much anything. So my question.

 Obviously Cal is much bigger than my cc, but I was wondering what your relationships are like towards your professors? For the most part are they less involved? Are you on a first name basis with any of them? I was especially thinking this in terms of class size, and I know that more popular classes tend to be pretty sizable...  But since I'm a transfer I could probably expect to not have to deal with most of the English classes that everyone's required to take.... so what are class sizes like for major classes that aren't GE? I feel like a lot of this isn't exactly necessary to know for my well being haha but I think being able to spend time getting to know my professors outside of class hours really helped me in cc, so I was curious."

This spring, we're offering our DeCal called the ""Beginner's Guide to the Universe!"" again, by popular demand!

In this course, we will cover some of the most important and mind-blowing discoveries in physics, including quantum physics, rocket science, and astrophysics.

Expect from the course an understanding of the fascinating questions asked (and sometimes answered) by physicists and astronomers throughout history, and an ability to confront popular science headlines with informed excitement and skepticism.

There are no math or physics prerequisites at all, just healthy curiosity and a willingness to ask questions! This year we also have no enrollment cap, so just sign up on Calcentral (the class is listed as Astro 98) to be guaranteed a spot. Use the course code 19090 and make sure to select two units. Lectures will be at 5-6:30pm on Thursday and discussion will be either 3-4pm Monday OR 2-3pm Thursday.

The problem is I'm really confused by its definition on the number of times I can go for free - It says Oral examination ""Two per plan year"". Soooo does that means for the my insurance plan that was covered for the first semester (August - December) or does it literally mean one full year and assumes that you would be with the insurance for at least one year. I may be really dumb but the definition is really vague and confusing to me! Link below is what I'm looking at - specifically the oral examinations.

&amp;#x200B;

During last year's admission cycle, I applied to the EECS M.Eng program, but was not admitted. Although disappointed, I decided that I would reapply this year. The EECS Grad Admissions FAQs imply that you are able to reuse letters of recommendations from a previous application, although it does say that it recommended that you get new letters. 

&amp;#x200B;

Seeing that I just applied the year before and I had asked the professors that I was closest to, I wanted to keep these letters for this year. Just to be sure, I reached out to the EECS Department months ago in October about reusing letters of recommendations and I was told that yes you can use your old recommendations for your three recommendations if you applied the year before. I did not see a place to reuse recommendations in the application and was told that if I submitted my application last year, my previous year's application will be linked with the new one and that is how you use old recommendations.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought great! Well, I finally put the finishing touches on my application on December 24th, and attempted to submit my application and I received the following error:

&amp;#x200B;

 Section Required       Field or Error

Recommendations      Enter at least three recommenders. 

&amp;#x200B;

So it seems I can't submit my application without adding new recommendations. I called them immediately, but was told that the offices were closed until January 6th, which is the deadline of the application. I tried to call a bunch of numbers today, on the 26th but no good, they all say January 6th and the message even said they'd be operating in limited capacity of the 6th through the 10th, so I am not even confident I would be able to get a hold of them then.

&amp;#x200B;

I do not know if there are many graduate students in this subreddit, but if anyone has any experience reusing letters of recommendation or has any advice for me, please share it with me, thanks."

This is an honor that rightfully belongs to us. This sub has been a shell of its former self ever since we were surpassed in subscriber count; and regaining the crown would provide just the jolt this place needs to get regain the energy and vigor we once had. 

Forreal, I'm so tired of taking shit from my HS friends who go to UCSD who constantly rub it in my face every time I see them about how their sub has more subscribers than ours. They laugh and bring it up constantly and I pretend it doesn't bother me and try to play it off, but deep down I fuckin' seethe in anger and even had to excuse myself once during a kickback at my apartment so that I could run to my room and scream into my pillow in anger for 6 straight minutes just so I wouldn't have to erupt in front of my visiting UCSD homies.

Doesn't anybody fucking care? I know the tang center doesn't seem to give a shit given that they don't think this is a serious enough matter to warrant counseling. But whatever.

Yeah yeah, I know some of you guys are gonna be all like, ""Dude, who cares, it's just a subscriber count."" Well you know what Stanley? (My roommate) Fuck off, dude. This is all I got. I have a fucking 2.3 gpa you stupid son of a bitch, you have no right to tell me what I should and shouldn't care about, asshole. Maybe if you actually washed your fucking dishes instead of leaving them on the coffee table or letting them pile up in the sink talking about ""hey yeah i'll wash them this weekend"" and then head off to san francisco with your batshit crazy gf all weekend instead of actually washing them I'd have other things worry about. But for now, this is my goddamn quest. And all of you should care as well.

Seriously, this fuckin shit keeps me up at night. During dead week I could barely fucking study and function because I was too busy keeping track of the subscriber counts between both subs. I've been clicking refresh all goddamn weekend staring at the counts and all you silly sons of guns have to talk about 61b course evals and EE16A grades or whatever trivial, banal bullshit that's on your mind. You're sitting there and acting like we're not in the middle of the second fucking COLD WAR, on the verge of closing the mf missile gap with the enemy. 

If you care about your school you'll get off your friggin butts and do something about this injustice. I'm so tired of walking around with this terrible look on my face due to the subscriber count disparity. My friends ask me, ""Hey Todd, you okay bud?"" To which I reply, ""Haha yeah, just thinking about HW and stuff. 61a is a doozy. Amirite?? Haha."" Well that's a fucking lie. The only thing that's causing this shitty mood I'm in is being the #2 UC subreddit w/r/t subscriber count.

We're currently at 30,941 while /r/UCSociallyDead is at 30,952. That's 12 fucking subscribers between us and greatness. What will you do about it??"

Before I get into the details of this, here is a quick overview of what this externship entails/offers:

* Resume building opportunity
* Learn about diversity and inclusion in higher education
* Networking with aCal State Fullerton Chicano/a Studies professor with a Ph.D. in Ethnic Studies and B.A. in Chicana/o studies and Anthropology at the UC Berkeley and other externs from UC Berkeley
* Research introduction and/or supplement to research experience
* Gaining experience in team collaboration
* Gain familiarity using library databases for research
* Applying and learning skills in Microsoft Excel/Google Sheets
* File organization/organization skills

In case you don’t know, the career center has this \[winter externship program\]([https://saservices.berkeley.edu/CCApps/Externship/Students/StudentHome.aspx](https://saservices.berkeley.edu/CCApps/Externship/Students/StudentHome.aspx)) where you get to shadow or work with someone in business, health, non-profit, education, etc. My externship is with a Chicano/a Studies professor at Cal State Fullerton ([http://hss.fullerton.edu/chicano/faculty/facultyProfile/a\_gradilla.aspx](http://hss.fullerton.edu/chicano/faculty/facultyProfile/a_gradilla.aspx)) that I did research with last year and it was a pretty fun and informative experience, with breaking that barrier between professors and students. More details about that in the picture. Last year, we had a team of 4, but this time only I applied for the research again. I’m trying to build up the team since having more people enhances the experience and offers more area for networking. I’m a Media Studies major, but last year we had people interested in political science, education policy, and legal theory. We all had lunch with the professor twice to discuss findings and the real-world implications of the research. Last year our topic was looking at professional/scholar views of the Latino Health Paradox. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*This year, the research can swing two ways\*\*. 

The focus can either be in 

\- Higher education literature research on mentoring and mentorship programs for students of color in higher education  (what programs or policies do faculty recommend for first-gen students and students of color)

\- The role of diversity and inclusion programs run by officers and administrators in higher education (how effective are diversity programs and do the deliver what they promise? Do the statistics surrounding college diversity follow with the diversity that schools boast about?)

\*\*The externship runs from about Jan 6 - Jan 17\*\*, but we will probably wrap up earlier than that.

If you think this experience would be valuable and interesting to you, then post a comment and/or email me at [jrash@berkeley.edu](mailto:jrash@berkeley.edu). I can put you into contact with the professor and we can do a video meeting to further discuss the project. It goes on for about a week but it is a really cool experience to chat with a professor like this! You don’t have to be in southern California to participate, by the way, as a lot of the actual work is collaborative collecting and organizing of information that we then talk about with the professor in whatever the most convenient way is (so can do video chat)

\####Deadline for response: January 1, 2020####

This class was supposed to be an easy A for me, and I aced all the projects but messed up the midterm, and did alright on the final.  But the main reason it feels so bad is because:

1. I have already taken the 61 series in its entirety and 70 and gotten B's and B+'s in those classes
2. I am taking upper division CS and EE classes starting next semester, and dont really know what this means for me

I dont really know what happened or how it happened, but Ive always felt wildely inconsistent as a student, and just cant seem to find a groove at all since starting college. I just feel like nothing I do to better myself as a student has worked, and am just getting tired of constantly saying to myself ""This semester Ill improve."" Ive never blamed my poor performances in anything on anyone except myself, and Ive always been optimistic. But this time it just really hurts because I tried to stay consistent this semester and it really was looking up until about the midpoint of the semester, when everything really started to kick in. I just dont know how to feel, and I feel my morale is just getting kicked down over and over again, and dont really know how many more times I can get back up. I have had strong highs in many of these classes, but I feel tired of not being able to hold on to it consistently. Its just been feeling like ive been inching towards a more depressive attitude, and the only thing thats been stopping me is my optimism. I just dont know how much longer I can do it, and I feel like im just gonna crash in a semester or two. I dont really know what im looking for in this post, but I thought maybe venting a little would help. I honestly felt like crying in some of my finals this semester because I felt so inadequate and know I could've done better, and felt that I had to put in 100x the amount of work to scrape up mediocre grades.

I guess my question is, will my research experience outweigh my GPA? I've heard academia is super competitive, so is it worth even continuing down this path if I can't even get into grad school? Also if I performed poorly inlower division classes, doesn't it basically guarantee failure in upper divs?

2. Is it very loud? How clean is it?
3. Are the houses similar to the dorms?  Would an apartment be better?

Reasons for 188: I likely want to do ML stuff in the future and really really wanna get started in AI stuff, which is why I wanted to add 188. Maybe will do some fast.ai this break. (Is this relevant for 188?) One point of caution though is that I want to get an A+ to maybe get into BAIR in the future, which may be harder considering this schedule.
 
Reasons for 110: Due to time conflict with breadth I will not be able to attend 188 lecture at all. Also I am self studying Axler (linear algebra done right textbook) over break for fun and I feel like I might as well take 110 to get credit for that as well (Is there strong overlap?)
 
Reasons for another breadth instead: Want to bump my GPA up a little bit and less work. I don't wanna push myself too hard though because last semester I struggled with 61c and 170. Did p well in the classes but found myself working way harder than I thought I would. However this might be because I am bad at project classes and significantly better at math classes, which is better for this intended schedule. Overall, I don't want to work more than 10 hours a day (ideally much less) for the sake of my mental health. In this case, then I will take 188 + 189 + 110 in fall instead of 189 + 188/110, both along with recruiting.
 
Any advice is greatly appreciated!"

It wasn't as cumbersome since I had taken just one technical course (Math 1A, I'm an international student and didn't know about APs till the end of senior year) and got done with a couple other breadths and university requirements. I'll be taking Physics 5A along with Math 1B next semester. I'm planning to pursue a PhD program after graduation and mostly get into academia after that.

What I have observed from my exposure to the field of research (in physics at least) is that there is a growing need of programming skills for analysis and other purposes. Because of this I was planning to do a minor in CS, hoping that it would help my cause as I pursue higher studies. But what I have heard is that CS courses at Cal are super time consuming and upper division courses are extremely hard to get into even for CS majors. I am also planning to get a double major in Astrophysics for which the lower div prerequisites are the same as that for Physics but except for CS61A, there aren't any course overlaps between CS and Astrophysics. I have 6 more semesters (and 4 summers) for which I have just made a tentative schedule.

I'm dead set on majoring in Physics but not so sure about the Astrophysics and CS part. Is it a feasible path to take? I would love to hear from people who have taken a similar route to this one and advise me on how to manage my schedule. If anyone wants additional info to help me decide, please let me know.

ei0ncq,Research Externship With An Chicano/Ethics studies Professor - Resume Opportunity for Jan 6 - Jan 17,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ei0ncq/research_externship_with_an_chicanoethics_studies/,monzano00,1,2019-12-31 01:23:46,0,/r/berkeley/comments/ei0ncq/research_externship_with_an_chicanoethics_studies/,NaN,"Apologies for the repost but felt compelled to clarify it and give it one last boost:

&amp;#x200B;

Before I get into the details of this, here is a quick overview of what this externship entails/offers:

&amp;#x200B;

Resume building opportunity

&amp;#x200B;

Learn about diversity and inclusion in higher education

&amp;#x200B;

\-Networking with a Cal State Fullerton Chicano/a Studies professor with a Ph.D. in Ethnic Studies and B.A. in Chicana/o studies and Anthropology at the UC Berkeley and other externs from UC Berkeley

&amp;#x200B;

\-Research introduction and/or supplement to research experience

&amp;#x200B;

\-Gaining experience in team collaboration

&amp;#x200B;

\-Gain familiarity using library databases for research

&amp;#x200B;

\-Applying and learning skills in Microsoft Excel/Google Sheets

&amp;#x200B;

\-File organization/organization skills

&amp;#x200B;

In case you don’t know, the career center has this winter externship program ([https://saservices.berkeley.edu/CCApps/Externship/Students/StudentHome.aspx](https://saservices.berkeley.edu/CCApps/Externship/Students/StudentHome.aspx)) where you get to shadow or work with someone in business, health, non-profit, education, etc. My externship is with a Chicano/a Studies professor at Cal State Fullerton ([http://hss.fullerton.edu/chicano/faculty/facultyProfile/a\_gradilla.aspx](http://hss.fullerton.edu/chicano/faculty/facultyProfile/a_gradilla.aspx)) that I did research with last year and it was a pretty fun and informative experience, with breaking that barrier between professors and students. More details about that in the picture. Last year, we had a team of 4, but this time only I applied for the research again. I’m trying to build up the team since having more people enhances the experience and offers more area for networking. I’m a Media Studies major, but last year we had people interested in political science, education policy, and legal theory. We all had lunch with professor Gradilla twice to discuss findings and the real-world implications of the research. Last year our topic was looking at professional/scholar views of the Latino Health Paradox.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*This year, the research can swing two ways\*\*.

&amp;#x200B;

The focus can either be in

&amp;#x200B;

\- Higher education literature research on mentoring and mentorship programs for students of color in higher education (what programs or policies do faculty recommend for first-gen students and students of color)

&amp;#x200B;

\- The role of diversity and inclusion programs run by officers and administrators in higher education (how effective are diversity programs and do they deliver what they promise? Do the statistics surrounding college diversity follow with the diversity that schools boast about?)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*The externship runs from about Jan 6 - Jan 17\*\*, but we will probably wrap up earlier than that.

&amp;#x200B;

If you think this experience would be valuable and interesting to you, then post a comment and/or email me at [jrash@berkeley.edu](mailto:jrash@berkeley.edu). I can put you into contact with the professor and we can do a video meeting to further discuss the project. It goes on for about a week but it is a really cool experience to chat with a professor Gradilla like this! It's personally been helpful in making me comfortable talking to professors at Berkeley, so I'm glad I did this last year. You don’t have to be in southern California to participate, by the way, as a lot of the actual work is collaborative collecting and organizing of information that we then talk about with the professor in whatever the most convenient way is (so can do video chat). I will give you the professor's email to ask about availability for meeting if you are interested and we can start working on the project in a week.

&amp;#x200B;

CS61A was the first coding class I’ve ever taken before (My high school had never offered comp sci classes) and I thought I could improve as the semester went by, but I always found the material overwhelming and difficult to grasp for some reason. I usually scored poorly on exams and always needed to attend office hours + tutoring to finish assignments and projects. Looking back, I should have dropped CS61A for CS 10, since I was also overwhelmed by the college transition in the first semester as well. However, I actually enjoy cs when I’m able to understand what I’m doing, and I’m able to visually see the outcome/impact of my own code, like through the CS61A projects and a couple websites I’ve built this past summer. Moving forward, any advice for CS 61B and CS 70? I would have to earn an A in CS61B and a A- or B+ to meet the 3.3 GPA gap or even have the chance to write an appeal letter.

2. what happens now? do i just go to a trial and try to defend myself?
3. how often do these cases get deemed false positives? is there a significant amount of people who get flagged and make it out innocent?
4. what happens if they find me guilty? how likely is it that i'll get kicked out or something super severe like that? i'd obviously get an F no matter what but would it just be as simple as having to retake it and maaybe getting academic probation?

I’m just really fucking angry/sad/disappointed right now. So I didn’t do well on the quest and midterm but after the midterm I put in a lot of work into the course and ended up clobbering very well with the final, or so I thought. 

Quest: 28–&gt;37
Midterm: 54–&gt; 67
Final: 72.5

So by this point I have a TCP of like 219, but after multiple rerubric-ing my clobber for midterm is all but removed. Anyway I’m sitting on the mean, or very above the mean if we count students who dropped (raw mean at 197). And if we just consider my exam scores they’re sitting at or above the means for each individual exam. So rumors by course staff of a 45 point bin shift start circulating because uh everyone did shit on the final lmao, and I’m chilling bc hey, guaranteed A- by a 3 point margin (for reference grading bins are 10points each).

Here’s where the fun starts. 

Staff decides to mess with the final exam rubric after we take the exam. My clobber for midterm tanks, horribly. The average score of the final goes up. My TCP drops to a 215. Okay, fine. Still A- with a 45 point bin shift and a bit of EPA magic. It’s chill. Staff announces bin shift will not be as dramatic because scores went up so well after rubric messing. Uh. My grade tanked. All my friends’ grades tanked. Whose scores are going up exactly? It’s fine, they’ll consider people who dropped the course like they did in 70. 

Staff announces EPA may play an outsize role in grades. Fantastic! I know I have a very high EPA score. Grades come out. I get a B+. 

I know this sounds really salty. And I’m not entitled to a good grade. But hey, I spent all of dead week holed up in Moffitt studying 61C. And it paid off on the final. And judging by Garcia’s grading trends I should have pulled an A-. I guess I’m just really angry that the rubric was changed after we took the exam. I’m angry that I put in a ton of work into this class (did all the labs and homeworks, spent 100 hours this semester in Soda slaving over the projects which I got full credit on), that I put more work into this class than any other I’ve taken at Cal, and still got lower than the 50th percentile. 

I didn’t put a lot of work into 70 and 16A and got a B+ in those courses. But when I actually spend a ton of time and effort and still get a B+? It’s a bit soul crushing. I’m honestly trying to hold back tears right now. God, it just feels really unfair (even though it isn’t) with all the rubric changes and the way the average shot up but my grade went down. It wouldn’t hurt as much if I didn’t work so hard. I really enjoyed this class and the grade that I got doesn’t represent that, and I know, grades aren’t everything. But they do mean something, don’t they? 

I want my grades to represent how many shits I gave. Chem 4A? Zero shits. Flunked the class (PNP at least). Engineering 7? Like one and a half shit. C+. Math 53? Yeah 1.5 shits. 16A? Three shits. 61A? Many shits. 

I gave many shits about 61C."

Here's some backstory: 

I originally took this class in Fall 2018 with her. I came in premed as a freshman and was MCB/IB. However, after scoring slightly below average the first Bio 1B midterm (so basically a D+, which lowered my grade to a B-) I had a panic attack, which aggravated my already severe depression and anxiety about life and my probability of making it to med school, and so I had to drop out of that semester. 

I wasn't on track to doing well in Chem 3B with Robak either; I had about a B/B+ average on quizzes (according to her grading scale) before I started developing serious mental health issues, at which point my quiz average dropped into the single digits out of 20. 

I switched majors to economics, but I've done some reflection over the break and have decided that I might want to be premed again. I think I have a much healthier perspective on GPA and have better control of my anxiety/depression. So--taking this class would be the first step towards being premed again. 

However, I'm a bit nervous. First of all, it's organic chemistry, and also, I remember I'd often feel a bit lost and overwhelmed with details in her lectures (side remarks she'd make about the chemistry/science of reactions if I remember correctly). 

I wasn't always very attentive during lectures but I remember having to re-watch webcasts afterwards because I couldn't get all the notes down. I also think that quizzes felt a bit hard and were a time crunch if I remember correctly. 

Her straight grading scale (with no curve) was also pretty scary, IMO. I know that I suck at organic chemistry, and that ""weeder"" classes like these have to have at least some standards, but I sorta think 85% for an A- in organic chemistry is a pretty tall order. 

Anyway, if anyone took this class and did well (or had any feedback to share), I'd like to know what you thought of it and what helped/didn't help."

I had to take colwrit r1a to fulfill my entry level writing requirement this semester, I took the course and passed my final portfolio with like an 86, which is the grade I’ve been receiving on all my essays. I asked my professor about the importance of this portfolio, she said that if you fail the portfolio, you’ll fail the class (even if you would have otherwise passed) and if you pass the portfolio, you should pass the class. I even asked her if it’s possible to pass the portfolio and fail the class, and she reiterated that if you pass the portfolio, you should pass the class.

Except I failed. 

Yeah, D in a 6 unit course. Really hurt my GPA. I looked over my assignments to see what went wrong, and it says I have 10/100 on my reading journals and reflections.

Which is strange, because under every reading journal assignment on her courses page, there is a box of texts that says “this assignment does not count towards the final grade.” And it only says this under the journals and reflections, not under my essays. I want to dispute this, because the courses page clearly says that the assignments do not count towards the final grade, yet they were counted. I failed because of it. I never did these assignments because I thought they were optional, and I remember asking about one reflection and my professor saying it would not count. I don’t have this in writing, it was an in-person question. I took screenshots and added time stamps of the bcourses page.

Is it worth it to dispute this? I sent my professor an email, but she hasn’t answered. How should I navigate this? I’m a bit lost, I’ve new to college and I’ve never had to dispute a grade before. Thank you for any help you can provide. :)"

I’m not a super outgoing person, but I don’t consider myself to be incredibly reserved either. I really just don’t know what’s happened this semester… I expected to find a group of people I fit in with and share mutual interests with, but it just hasn’t happened. I’ve heard the “you just have to put yourself out there” thing many, many times, and have genuinely tried to do that to the best of my ability. I tried ultimate frisbee (loved the sport, didn’t really vibe with the girls), tried out for club soccer (didn’t make it, that one stung), and have tried the old “hey we should hang out and study sometime!” bit with people in classes, to no avail. I live off campus in a single, so there hasn’t really been the forced dorm friendships like I had freshman year at my old school. I considered joining Greek life, but I feel like I don’t fit in physically with the sorority ideals.

I have one or two friends from my hometown that I see every now and then, but they live their very separate lives. 

It just seems like everyone already has their “thing” and their group of friends on campus, and it’s getting to be so discouraging. 

How tf do I make friends?"

&gt;In addition, the notes request that Harrison Ford to be cast as Indy’s “old fashioned” professor. He is, as the script describes him, “a bit racist, a bit sexist, and very closed minded. So, basically, just white.”

Hello,

I am writing to educators, academics, and academic institutions to encourage the adoption of a course of study related to the issue of “ufos” (the most commonly used term though the United Stated government and many others today prefer the term “unidentified aerial phenomenon” or “uap”).

Despite the “breaking news” on this subject since the NY Times report of December 2017 (when they identified a Pentagon UFO study program and released Navy pilot film), signs of a continued avoidance to addressing this subject remain.

Nevertheless, there are beginning signs of a growing recognition of the need to address this, no matter where this leads. In September 2019, Politico’s Bryan Bender noted an interesting statement by the Ranking Member of the House Homeland Security Committee, Matk Walker (R-NC). Walker had been making inquiries in a partially frustrated attempt to determine whether the Chinese or Russians have made an extraordinary and dramatic leap in technology. It appears he may be realizing something else may be happening:

“In a recent interview, Walker, a former pastor, also acknowledged that he is open to the possibility that there are no easy explanations—or the answers could change how humanity perceives the known universe.”

Since preparing a course of study for a long-ignored subject may be a difficult and confusing process at the start, I want to identify a resource that can serve as a good starting point for that:

THE UFO ENCYCLOPEDIA, 3rd Edition, Two Volumes, edited by Jerome Clark. (Make sure you get the 2018 released 3rd edition; published by OMNIGRAPHICS.)

There are very limited UFO courses in a very small number of academic institutions; these may serve as helpful models.

There are also a few expensive online UFO courses of study.

Since I have had 50 plus years of intermittently engaging in a concentrated study of the subject, I began in late May 2019 to write educational content for different aspects of this subject:

http://cosmic-pluralism-studies.academy

As stated there, the material can be freely adopted, or utilized in any way, without attribution.

Finally, it would be great to see academic institutions as a safe refuge for encounter experiencers to relate their experiences in a setting that adheres to strict standards in research, something often lacking in the uncredentialed arena of ufology.

Thankyou for considering this.

Awards: I’ll graduate as a scholar with distinction which is the highest honor for graduates at my school.  

Extracurriculars: founded my school’s astronomy club because even though i don’t have any interest in pursuing science, astronomy fascinates me. I’m VP of the club. I’ve also played soccer for 13 years, most of it on club but i stopped this year because of mental health and injuries. I didn’t play for my school team because of my mental health and also, and this sounds snobby i know, but because the quality of play is shit and the risk of injury is high. I volunteer at my local library shelving and reading and one of my future job aspirations is a librarian 

Other: I feel like my essays were pretty strong so I’m not too worried about them, but I’m terrified that I didn’t do enough throughout high school because I told myself I would just go to community college to save money

ekaskj,Has anyone ever felt totally stuck between several career paths but simultaneously didn't feel good enough for any of them?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ekaskj/has_anyone_ever_felt_totally_stuck_between/,AnxiousGoldenBear,8,2020-01-05 01:17:26,4,/r/berkeley/comments/ekaskj/has_anyone_ever_felt_totally_stuck_between/,NaN,"So before college I didn't really think much about career stuff. My parents kinda made it seem like if I got into a place like Berkeley I'd be fine afterwards (i.e. would get a high paying or at least decent job). Long story short, I learned the hard way that was not the case. 

For some background on myself, I'm economics (waiting to see if I can declare but probably can...) and might do data science or premed (only one of the two though). 

I'm currently stuck in between 3 career paths: business (marketing or consulting mainly but maybe also accounting), premed or prelaw. I'm mostly more serious about the first two but don't feel like I'm really good enough for any of the fields. 

Business because I lack knowledge and soft skills (struggle a lot with social anxiety, and just switched into economics from another major, and honestly economics is way too math-y and academic anyway).  I also find case interviews pretty stressful and challenging.

Premed and prelaw because grades: took a few premed classes here and while I didn't fail any of them, yikes. Also not sure if I'd make it through medical school in one piece or whether I'd pass the bar exam. I honestly think I'm just into med and law school because I'm not ready, or good enough, to get a job in business after graduation. 

I had a rough finals week so I was honestly sorta looking forward to this break. But honestly, over the break I just became even more anxious about the future. 

During the break, I've talked to my family and friends about their experiences, a bunch of interview and career coaches, applied for a few internships, and rearranged my schedule to keep my options open, but I'm still pretty scared/unsure about what comes after graduation. 

The fact that I still don't have a summer internship as a sophomore is kind of making me more anxious--did fall recruiting with lots of consulting firms but most experiences were L's (not to mention I don't really think I applied to as many gigs as I should have over the break).

Idk, I feel stuck and know that I'm the only one who can do anything about it, and I have taken steps to kind of figure out what I want, at least by signing up for the relevant classes. 

But at the same time, I don't feel like I'm doing enough, which is making me even more anxious. However, I don't know what else I should be doing apart from maybe practicing more case interviews, networking and applying to stuff. 

To make matters worse, I feel like everyone knows what they want to do (friends-wise, at least), whether that is product management, SWE, etc. Really high paying jobs that they actually have the experience and background to get into. Unlike me, lol. I don't know what I want and my experience is...questionable. I've tried just focusing on myself, but that just makes me even more anxious...

Honestly, my goal after graduation is just to land something that's 45k and up with some benefits, and preferably something that isn't dead-end and has room for promotion or something like that. I just don't want to be unemployed and clueless after graduating while still living with my parents. 

Does anyone relate/has anyone else been in this situation before?"

&amp;#x200B;

I was looking at colleges for Environmental Energy Sciences and Engineering and of course UC Berkeley has been on my radar for a while, but I had been planning to go to UW Madison simply because in-state tuition is so much cheaper. But, just a couple days ago I was doing some research into classes at UW Madison and it turns out they don't have the major I wanted. Since Berkeley was second on my list, I double checked and everything with classes and majors checks out so I started looking at tuition. This is where this becomes a problem, my family is in the grey zone where we are privileged enough that we cannot file for financial aid, but don't make enough to send me to college outright. My mother also implied she would pull any financial support i would've received if I choose to go out of state. There is no way i can pay out of state tuition rates without some kind of help, its just not possible.  


In addition to this, as the title tells you, I am a closeted trans woman, but i'm in an extremely  transphobic home. Berkeley is my way out, to get away from my mother and start living how I want to. Berkeley offers majors in what I've always wanted to do(Solar Energy Engineering), its one of the best colleges in the US for that. But more than that, Berkeley is one of the most LGBTQ+ friendly colleges, even offering HRT through the college itself which for me is life changing. It is also halfway across the nation, where I will finally have some privacy, where my mother cannot keep me under her thumb.   


So, my question is, who would I email about tuition breaks if that is even possible? Should I use my legal  name, or my preferred name? Just general things like this I don't know what to do and Berkeley is probably my last hope at this point."

&gt;  A total of 993 applications were received, of which 893 met basic qualifications. The LSI Committee conducted a first review and evaluated candidates based solely on contributions to diversity, equity and inclusion. Only candidates that met a high standard in this area were advanced for further review, narrowing the pool down to 214 for serious consideration...  Limiting the first review to contributions in DE&amp;I is itself a dramatic change of
emphasis in the typical evaluation process which generally focuses on primarily on research accomplishments.

76% of the applicant pool in the first review was eliminated ""based solely on contributions to diversity, equity and inclusion"". 

&gt; Three departments (MCB, PMB and ESPM) are experimenting with new interventions in the coming year and
emphasizing diversity, equity and inclusion in the first review is now an agreed practice in these departments. 

This has become an official practice now.

&gt; Possible scores based on the rubric ranged from 3-15. Applicants who had scores that diverged widely were assigned a third reader. A minimum average score of 11 or a combined total score of 22 (across two committee reviewers) was required to continue to the next round of review. 
The rubric in question: https://ofew.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/rubric_to_assess_candidate_contributions_to_diversity_equity_and_inclusion.pdf

It's not enough to even have:

&gt; Clear knowledge of, experience with, and interest in dimensions of diversity that result from different identities, such as ethnic, socioeconomic, racial, gender, sexual orientation, disability, and cultural differences

But they must:
&gt; Describes multiple activities [in advancing diversity] in depth, with detailed information about both their role in the activities and the outcomes. Activities may span research, teaching and service, and could include applying their research skills or expertise to investigating diversity, equity and inclusion

And have a:

&gt; Clear and detailed ideas for what existing programs they would get involved with and what new ideas they have
for advancing equity and inclusion at Berkeley and within their field, through their research, teaching, and/or service. 

I understand screening candidates to make sure they aren't racist jerks but diversity-related ""knowledge"", activities and plans shouldn't be the *main* criteria for the life sciences department. ""The typical evaluation process which generally focuses on primarily on research accomplishments"" is more sensible."

ekqrio,Has anyone else experienced this with UCLA kids?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ekqrio/has_anyone_else_experienced_this_with_ucla_kids/,Calthrowaway34,1,2020-01-05 23:35:59,87,/r/berkeley/comments/ekqrio/has_anyone_else_experienced_this_with_ucla_kids/,NaN,"Okay so, given that we're at a pretty special and reputable university, one of the best in the country, I have found it common to observe that, regardless of where I go outside of Berkeley, people generally react with admiration and praise upon hearing where I go to school. For instance, it is not uncommon for me to observe people's eyebrows rise in admiration, display expressions of pleasant surprise, or mouth the words ""wow,"" denoting, obviously, an acknowledgement of Berkeley's academic pedigree, reputation and all the implications about one’s personal ability, intelligence and IQ that accompany attendance here. 

I've grown accustomed to these reactions. I would be lying if I said I didn’t feel little endorphin rush each time I received such praise. If I’m being completely honest, I seek opportunities where I can name-drop Cal into conversations with individuals whom I’ve just met so that it raises my personal stock in their eyes. After all, it feels good to be smart and be acknowledged as such. Usually, simply uttering the name Berkeley is all it takes for the person I’m speaking with to change their orientation and begin treating me with a little more respect. 

This is the case about 90% of the time. 

The other 10% can be divided into two cases: people who don’t know much about college rankings or colleges in general, and the second group is UCLA students. Typically, these people will learn that I am a Berkeley student and not bat an eye or show any added respect. The person in the former group will simply ask what I'm studying. I don't take offense to these folks because I simply attribute their reactions to a lack of information. The latter group, however, the Bruins, tend to say things like, “cool, what are you studying there?” or “How do you like it there?” or “What’s your major?” without any facial expressions that convey acclamation for the fact that I attend Cal. In fact, I can’t think of a time when a Bruin treated me with the same instant high-esteem I’d expect from 90% of people I encounter. This is starting to bug me more and more given that they obviously know about UC Berkeley and what kind of institution it is. Whereas the first group's excuse is that they are simply ignorant on the subject, I haven't figured out why UCLA kids don't react the same way as students from other UCs and the general population. 

I have probably encountered dozens of students--throughout my travels across the state during my three years at Cal--from every UC campus. All across the board, from UC Merced to Riverside and even UCSF, students from these campuses show instant respect and display kudos and are generally impressed when they learn that I’m a Golden Bear. This is true for every campus *except* UCLA. 

And I’m left wondering: Do you think they do this on purpose? What possible reason could they have for not reacting like 90% of the population does? It’s pretty perplexing. It’s started to bother me lately—mostly because I went back to visit my grandparents in SoCal over break and ran into UCLA students all over LA county. Their reactions, upon hearing what school I attend, showed the same neutral faces or light smiles as before I uttered the Berkeley name. Their orientation to me didn’t change at. There were no raised eyebrows accompanied by ""oohhs."" To be honest, I'm not used to this.

When I meet a UCSD student, for example, they show a lot of respect and tend to light up. Many of them become excited with lots of questions about attending Berkeley; barring that I have to be somewhere, I tend to stick around, sharing what life is like at Cal. But with UCLA students, I never experience this at all. I feel like maybe they don’t know their place in the pecking order? I understand if this comes off as super petty and perhaps a little pretentious, but I wanted to see if anybody had any experience this. If so, what did you do about it?"

Could anyone offer me pointers as to where I could be looking?

I feel like the older I get the worse my grades get. I remember first semester here, I took CS 61A, EE 16A, and Math 53, and Berkeley seemed like a joke. 53 was easier than high school calc, 61A was pretty straightforward, and 16A was really easy. Especially considering that I thought the circuits in AP E&amp;M were way harder than 16A, I didn't see why people sucked at that class so much. That semester I pulled an easy straight A semester. Same thing second semester, with CS 70, 61B and EE 16B.

However, the longer I'm here, the worse my grades get. For example, this semester I got destroyed in CS 164, EE 126, and a grad EECS class I was taking, despite only taking 12 units. I also got destroyed last semester in Math 104, Stat 150, and CS 162. This was also a min unit semester. I'm keeping the same 3 tech a semester pace, but now I barely pull a 3.5. 

I'm beginning to think that all these people with ""comeback stories"" of massive unit loads are tricking themselves. Like a semester 3-UD semester of CS100, CS188, and CS 160 is gonna be way easier than 3-LD semester of CS 70, EE 16b, and CS 61c. Lower divs are single streamed, but upper divs are extremely stratified. As in the demographic that takes EE 126 is gonna be way different than that in Data 100, despite both classes being geared around ""data science"".

I’m a little unsure about how many units I should be taking moving forward. Since I have some AP credit, I’d be able to take 12 units every semester (CNR minimum) and graduate in 4 years just fine. Is this common? Or would it be better if I take 13-16 and get to my upper divs faster? Also, I haven’t given much thought to a minor as of right now.

For background , I took Math 191 and H110 this past semester, and am taking H113, 104 and 191 along with Phil 149 (phil of math) this next semester. I am also a philosophy (or logic haven't decided for sure yet) double major.     

Questions regarding research: would it be too early in my math career to participate in an URAP or apply to an REU for this summer? additionally, what are the odds I would even be accepted (4.0 first sem and prob 20 on putnam if that is relevant) at a solid REU? 

Questions regarding summer programs: Should I take 185 through the Berlin program with professor Holtz this summer or should I take it at Berkeley? The pluses I see to taking it through Berkeley is that it is significantly cheaper and I can take additional classes that interest me (like 61a, Phil 25B, Math 115/126, etc), but I've heard great things about professor Holtz and so I'm curious for input from someone who has participated in the program.       

In general, what can I do to optimize my spring semester and summer? I want to pursue a PhD and so would like to do everything I can to bolster my CV as early on as possible.

Now that I've been here for a while, I don't think Berkeley is necessarily cutthroat/backstabby, but I get the vibe that it's very competitive (some students are really capable and at the top of their fields and go for all the top firms/tech jobs/top graduate/med schools). 

I feel like I'm pretty average in comparison academically and in terms of work experience also. I think Berkeley's competitive environment has made me work harder for stuff I have achieved, but that my ""hard work"" is also motivated by fear (i.e. fear of being behind internships-wise, fear of being the only one out of my friends who's unemployed/working a dead-end low paying job, fear of failing a hard test). 

I came from a sort of competitive school that wasn't really a ""top"" HS, like Gunn HS or whatever, but also not a crappy school. So I was sort of used to competitive environments, but also not. And early on the competitiveness just made me super anxious and insecure. It was motivating, sure, but I was motivated mainly by fear and wanting to keep up. It was like running a marathon severely dehydrated + with other health problems but forcing yourself to put one foot in front of the other to keep on. 

However, my friends from the Bay Area (born and raised there) kinda just shrug it off and are like ""well the competitiveness helped me because it made me work harder."" Are Bay Area kids just used to this (as a non-Bay Area native, I get the sense that living in the Bay Area is sorta like the survival of the fittest, just because it costs so goddamn much to live here, lol), or does the competitiveness of Berkeley really help?

I remember before DailyCal was constantly filled with SJW articles complaining about identity politics, etc. But now it's much more normal and talks about things not necessarily obsessed with any social justice cause.

What really surprised me was when the new about the Life Sciences department hiring faculty based on ""diversity contribution"", most of the comments here were actually against using race/gender as a basis for hiring research faculty. This is a huge shift as few years ago the popular opinion on here would be that it's justified to discriminate based on race/gender for the sake of diversity.

Students now also seem much more supportive of free speech and less inclined to the ""call out"" culture and ""safe space"".

I have no internship or research experience, but have been doing relatively well in my classes and am a TA for one of the introductory CS classes. No meaningful side projects, literally my only projects have been from CS classes. Can't really find time for extracurriculars because when I'm not studying I am usually working to pay off school (luckily have been able to be debt-free so far). I am incredibly grateful for the position I am in right now, but I've just been doubting myself recently as I am planning for the semester and the summer.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I was recently updating my resume and realized my peers just have so many more accomplishments than me. I don't have anything lined up for me this summer. I would love to get a software-related internship, but don't feel as though I am competitive enough when it comes to employable experience. I am also totally open to do research in Berkeley over the summer, but I don't know where to begin with that considering that I don't really know any professor all that well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the rambling, but I wanted to know if anyone who's been in a similar position to me has any advice. I fear that I am running out of time in my undergraduate career and opportunities are disappearing faster than I'd like. Specifically, if you have research experience, how did start getting involved? Also, if you have internship experience,  how did you combat feeling underqualified in the application process? And lastly, what helped you find your ""niche"" at Berkeley?

We witness you a new way of life, understand our people, our history and our culture.

The program is flexible with the start and end dates, ranging from 8-16 days internship program which will start from February 2020

Looks like a great community!

I have a question for you fortunate Berks;

I'm working on a paper discussing Hak Kyung Cha's *Dictée*  through Glissant's poetics of relation. While I have found some  interesting sources already, there is one book that I would really love  to take a look at:  Kang, Laura Hyun Yi., and Alarcón Norma. *Writing Self, Writing Nation: a Collection of Essays on Dictée by Theresa Hak Kyung Cha*. Third Woman Press, 1994.  Unfortunately, my (Dutch) library does not carry this collection.

Is  there, by any chance, anybody among you who knows how or where I could  find this source? My paper is due Thursday, which makes it short notice.  I only received a good-to-go on my proposal yesterday (though,  admittedly, I should have just requested it per ILL weeks before  anyway).

Happy weekend!"

He also missed one of our scheduled meetings completely.  The ""tasks"" he gave me were along the lines of ""download the data"", ""see what you can do,"" and, ""try reading the data into Python."" Admittedly, I only downloaded the data, and when I told him I had done so, he just never replied to my email. About a month later, he emailed me asking me how the research was going, if I'd made progress, and if I wanted to meet to discuss things. I replied, a bit upset about the whole situation, saying that the only thing I had done was download the data, also that I wouldn't be continuing the URAP next semester but appreciated the opportunity and would still be willing to meet to wrap the semester up if he saw fit. No response. And now, I have an NP on my transcript.

URAP is supposed to be supervised research. To be honest, it felt like the majority of the time I was the done doing the supervision of the professor. If any of you know what I could do about this, I'd appreciate any feedback!"

I used to have one friend from a summer class but since I never made the effort to go to her church things, we never got closer and she isn't good at replying to texts, my main form of communication. 

My two close friends are great and I'm also part of online groups that fill my need to be social. I'm very introverted, so I don't need that much interaction and would prefer close friends over many superficial connections.

However, sometimes I'll see groups of friends hanging out near campus or just people tagging a whole bunch of people in memes or whatever, and I'll feel sad that I don't have a ""friend group,"" just disjointed connections from random classes and stuff. 

Sometimes I look back with regret at not nurturing closer friendships from people I met freshman year (from my dorm floor or just random people I met that I clicked with). I was premed and super depressed, so I was always studying or too distressed to hang out. However, I've put in the effort to work on my mental health and improve. 

So...does anyone have any advice on where I could meet more friends? I only have 4 semesters left if that makes a difference. Also, feel free to PM or chat me if you need a friend or would like to talk further. 

A bit about myself: Econ major, might get a DS minor or be premed; loves pop music, psychology, public policy, boba, writing, reading (sometimes), and swimming. Taking Econ 100B, Econ 140 (or Econ 133), Chem 3B, and Data 8 next semester. Introverted but can be more open if we get to know each other better."

Maybe also everyone being someone who is working hard to get good grades while also doing clubs/personal projects too. In addition, I got the impression people just like to work by generally not collaborating. 

For those who are also from a CC, do you feel like the definition of rigorous can be expanded upon? Do you feel the same way as me? I'm curious for what other CC transfers have to say from the stem majors and non stem majors. 

In my opinion, I feel that if students from CC take engineering classes at Cal it is doable. They just have to have time management skills, be not shy to go to office hours, don't rely on the professor, do learning on their own, and ask questions when stuck."

Would any of you be able to evaluate how useful these courses were for 189 prep? Also, is it worth it to take both courses even though I fully intend to work in CS? There is a chance that I end up taking EE 16B in my sophomore spring - is it feasible to take 16B concurrently with one of these courses? Moreover, I found the EE 127 syllabus to be very interesting (I might take it senior year if I have time), but I've heard that it is a badly planned course (much like CS 61B of late). EE 126 on the other hand is a ton of work.

Finally, for someone who wants to get into doing grad courses (and ultimately a 5th years masters), when is the best time to take the upper division course that you ultimately want to specialize in?

CalVisitor DNS has never, ever worked for me.  I can connect and ""ping [8.8.8.8](https://8.8.8.8)"" but resolving any URLs fails.

If you have a server you can SSH into, you can do the following:

1. Establish a SOCKS5 proxy to the server: \`ssh -D 9000 &lt;user&gt;@&lt;hostname&gt; -fNq\`
2. Go to Firefox Preferences, type ""proxy"" in the search and go to Settings.  Use ""Manual proxy configuration"", uncheck ""Use this proxy server for all protocols"", fill in the SOCKS host/port to be [127.0.0.1](https://127.0.0.1) and 9000 respectively.
3. Scroll down and check ""Proxy DNS when using SOCKS v5"".

Now DNS requests over Firefox should tunnel through the server.  However, any non-Firefox programs will still use the system-configured CalVisitor DNS, so you'll need to tunnel DNS system-wide.

What works for me is installing [sshuttle](https://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle) and running:

    sshuttle -vvv --dns 8.8.8.8:53 -r &lt;user&gt;@&lt;hostname&gt;

This will route DNS requests system-wide to your server.

Have the UCB website and portal for transfers been updated yet? Because so far it says:

"" Welcome! This site contains important updates for students preparing to transfer to Berkeley while the new [ASSIST](https://assist.org/) site is in development. ""

and in the Gen Ed form

"" \*UC Berkeley will honor the 16/17 academic year as listed on ASSIST.ORG except for select majors. Please review our [Berkeley Course Transferability Guide](http://apply.berkeley.edu/register/transfer_guides). If your major does not show for your college, please use the agreements for the 16/17 academic year on ASSIST.org. ""

The website and the form in the portal both say that UCB with honor the 2016-17 agreement which is outdated since CS has a 2018-19 and 19-20 one (which my friends, counselors, and I have been using). The new site has been completed since before the fall 2019 applications. 

Another post 7 months ago asked the same thing and it said they'll honor the 16-17 agreements until the new site is finished.... but they did before November so we've been using it.

The difference between 2016-17 with the other 2 is diff. eqn. and linear algebra are not on the most recent agreements. I won't have diff. unless I crash in the spring.

Will they really use the 2016-17 one or did they forget to update? Did transfers in 2019 use the 18-19 agreement or 16-17 like it says?

I arrived a few minutes early and sat down in the front row. More and more students entered the classroom. After a few minutes, a particular student walked in. I remember I turned my head and saw his beautiful, energetic smile. For a split second (which felt much more than that), our eyes met. At that moment, his radiant smile made me smile unconsciously as well. I had never felt like this before. I got shy and lowered my gaze, and saw his fluffy red boots. He walked towards the chairs to take a seat.

After a few minutes, no TA showed up for that session. I remember the moment that he stood up, walked to the front of the classroom(as if he would start teaching us), and made a clever joke about the situation. 

It's been weeks after that short encounter, yet thinking about his radiant personality gives me butterflies every time. I've been thinking about him a lot. I know the encounter was very short, but the way he looked in my eyes felt like we had known each other for years.

I really wish I can meet him again... Perhaps in CS61B? I choose to stay hopeful.

I wish him the best."

I am a freshman right now, and first semester I joined two student groups on campus that are more recreational (though this semester i am taking on leadership roles in them, so they are certainly important to me and an investment of my time.) However, this semester there are so many new things I want to try, namely activities that deal more with professional skills. I really want to try them out (peruse this world of consulting, business clubs, research, and healthcare decals, to name a few) and at the same time i want to meet more people in a fun environment. 

I want to stay involved in my two activities - I am passionate about what I do in them - but between them and the part time job I have a pretty solid chance of securing, i know I will only have time for one professional based activity (and dont think spreading myself too thin is a good move with ochem this semester.) if you were in my shoes, what groups you are a part of would you suggest? I want something professional, but still with a good social atmosphere. Or should i stick to my current responsibilities and pursue professional things in the fall? I’m in a weird spot between what I know i love to do but also feeling limited to exploring all the opportunities I have at cal, that I feel i’ll regret trying to do.

And I heard that it was meant to be the exemption

From the classes that are 61A and 70

Throwing difficult brainteasers at you endlessly

But just as I thought I could declare

I looked at Hilf’s bins and felt despair

I came here to learn and not to stress

But declaring CS is starting to feel like a game of chess

I know enrollment is at an all time high

And in fact the cap has really pushed me to try

But its discouraging to truly love a subject

Only to get kicked out of it like a reject

I love coding and making computers do stuff

I never thought that doing so could be so tough

But doing what’s hard is the most fulfilling

Yet the prospect of not declaring is extremely chilling

I hope the CS department lifts the curtain

And tells us whether our future is certain"

This year Microsoft brought several AI and research-based teams together at a new site in Berkeley. Having a physical presence near U.C. Berkeley, a renowned institution for research and education, complements the academic nature and learning mindset of the teams located here.

Two groups that will be located on the seventh floor at 1919 Shattuck Ave. joined Microsoft last year through acquisition. [Semantic Machines](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/05/20/microsoft-acquires-semantic-machines-advancing-the-state-of-conversational-ai/) and [Bonsai](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/06/20/microsoft-to-acquire-bonsai-in-move-to-build-brains-for-autonomous-systems/), now the [Autonomous Systems](https://blogs.microsoft.com/bayarea/2019/09/11/innovating-for-impact-a-machine-teaching-platform-for-autonomous-systems/) team, are both dedicated to developing AI technologies that push innovation to the next level. [David Hall](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dlwhall/), principal researcher at Semantic Machines, is focused on building a team that advances the state of conversational AI. Using the power of machine learning, the technology they are working on will enable users to discover, access, and interact with information and services in a much more natural way, and with significantly less effort. “The future of human computer interaction is conversation—actual back and forth dialogues between you and a machine carried out in natural language,” says Hall. “Think today’s technology, but without having to carefully memorize commands, or spell out every single step. We’ve assembled an amazing team of researchers and engineers in speech and natural language processing to work on this, and we look forward to deepening our connection to Berkeley’s learning culture.”

The space is specifically designed to drive collaboration in a modern, welcoming environment. It is geared toward driving interaction not only with the teams there, but also the local academic community. Microsoft is a proud sponsor of the [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) lab, co-located in the building, as well as the [Real-Time Intelligent Secure Explainable Systems (RISE)](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/) lab, and [Simons Institute](https://simons.berkeley.edu/). The proximity to these groups enables Microsoft to be a better partner, connect with others through  research, and educate students on the opportunities available to them when exploring careers in technical fields."

I'm currently in my 4th semester here at Cal and am an undeclared intended CS major in L&amp;S. As a bit of background, I have already taken 61a and 61b in the first two semesters of my first year, and unfortunately didn't do great in them - I have to get an A- in CS70 if I want to be able to declare. Originally, I was taking CS70 last semester, but I only scored ~0.5 std deviations above the mean on the first midterm and just around the mean on the second one, so I ended up late dropping the class and deciding to retake it in the future as I would have had to do pretty well on the final to get an A-.

After dropping the class, my plan was as follows:

**Spring 2020**
* Take CS61C along with some EE/Data Science classes in order to get lower division requirements out of the way and gain more programming experience.
* Apply to more summer software development internship positions.

**Summer 2020**
* If I get an internship, do the internship.
* If not, take CS70, since you get a separate drop for summer courses so I have another fallback in case I fuck up with 70 again.

**Fall 2020**
* If I had an internship in the Summer, take CS70 and declare at the end of my first semester of my 3rd year.

I have contacted my academic adviser about this as well, but pending a response, my question is this: is this schedule allowed and/or viable? I picked my current semester schedule with this plan in mind, but I am now questioning it as I was recently informed about the fact that there is also a registration hold placed on people who have accrued too many units but still haven't declared, which could be an issue if I end up taking 70 in the fall. Moreover, I am also concerned since declaring in the fall of my Junior year would only leave me 3 semesters to explore upper division CS classes here at Cal. Any insight would be greatly appreciated!"

As you may have realized, meeting new friends can be tough at Cal and it is easy to feel isolated. Many clubs are difficult to get into and it can be demoralizing when you are not able to join a club, especially if you were motivated by the chance to meet new friends. 

In order to remedy this, me and a few others created a ""Social Club"" of sorts where anyone can join so that they can can meet new friends in a low-anxiety environment. Basically, we started a discord that anyone can join (but please be civil). We thought discord might be a great way for people to get a feel for one another and ideally there could be some gatherings every so often. This is a dedicated social server so we hope to distinguish ourselves from the /r/berkeley discord in that way. Since we just started the server, it may be kind of slow at first but I am confident we can get it going quickly. Please leave any suggestions down below, we hope for this to turn into a sizable club that provides a low pressure environment for people to meet one another in. Let us know what you think!

I've been offered a Group Tutor position for Data 100.

Pros:

Getting cash money at $19/hour

Some teaching experience/work experience, building communication skills

Course staff community has a great reputation for being fun/enjoyable/social

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

8 hours/week time commitment, much of which is reviewing material, grading written assignments/exams, proctoring all of which is not teaching time; would rather spend this on clubs, studying, etc.

Fee remission decision will probably significantly lower my chances of TA'ing in the future

Class has a more tangential relation to CS than other courses, e.g. 61A, B, C

&amp;#x200B;

My questions:

How heavy is the time commitment? With 16 units (including CS 170), I want to be able to do reasonably well in all of my courses.

In the longer term, how valuable will it have been to be part of course staff(s) if I'm just looking to go into industry after graduation? Outside of having a potentially good experience this semester, I'm not sure I will really mention this on a resume; should I just focus on applying for internships instead?"

I've been browsing though research programs such as SUPERB ([https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/research/superb](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/research/superb)), but this seems to be open only to US citizens and residents, which I am not (I'm an international student).

Is there anywhere else I could look to in order to get a research position over the summer?

For context, I am currently a junior majoring in computer science. I have completed all comp sci lower divs and CS 170 so far. I will also be doing CS 161 and CS 162 this spring.

thanks!"

I’m just wondering how possible it is for me to request an extra year, and how/when I should apply for it for the highest chance of getting that approved

This is just a proposal and hopefully a planning thread. A real megathread could be created by the mods and stickied for a week. 

I’m thinking parent comments would be categories of orgs. Child comments could be orgs commenting with a quick description of themselves, what they look for in new members, and links to their social media, info session ppt, or recruitment timeline. 

It would be way more efficient and sustainable compared to being hounded by 500 clubs with 50000 flyers each. It would also broaden awareness and reach for clubs that don’t have the resources necessary to table, and maybe even the ones that do. It's ridiculous we had to ban clubs from setting up [until 6am](https://www.dailycal.org/2020/01/23/sproul-plaza-closed-to-student-organizations-between-midnight-6-a-m/). Clubs could start posting the week before school starts, when they have more time to answer questions. 

It can be a new /r/berkeley tradition, first 2-3 weeks of every semester. 

I’m thinking categories would be:

* Consulting Clubs
* Exercise-related clubs
* Music-related clubs
* Tech-related clubs
* Biology-related clubs
* Business-related clubs (non-consulting focused)
* Humanities-related clubs
* Design-related clubs

Other categories I can’t think of, suggest below. Not sure if it would be better for clubs to post under multiple categories or just one.

Clubs would respond with:

* Name
* Description/focus
* Competitive? Y/N
* Average time commitment: 
* Spring 2020 app deadline (if applicable)
* Looking for: (description of what they look for in new members)
* Related links: 

Thoughts? Seems like an easy thing to do that touches on improving mental health, environmental sustainability, and friend-making, all of which are discussed on this sub pretty often."

I hope this email finds you well. My name is \[\] and I am currently a Freshman planning on majoring in Economics and minoring in Data Science. However, last week, I realized I can complete my economics major by next spring. 

However, while I realize that I must declare by my 5th semester or by the 80 units (whatever comes second), I was wondering that since I must graduate next year, do I declare now? However, with that, I am not currently taking one of the prerequisites necessary to declare right now. 

As I technically in my second semester, do you believe that I can still declare next semester and still graduate in spring 2021? If not, I am prepared to drop one of my classes and take one of the prerequisites instead if necessary. 

Moreover, while I do realize that there are drop-in meetings, none of my timings match up. Again, however, I am ok with skipping something to make sure that I can make it to an appointment. 

I apologize for spitting all of the info out, but if we can somehow schedule an appointment, I would truly appreciate it. """

I always lie to her that I ""saw a friend"" for dinner and whatnot, even though I spend most of my days alone. It's embarrassing to me that it's ""expected"" that I hang out with people when I actually don't, especially when I see everyone else doing it like its no big deal.

I think about not having many friends here all the time. I guess I'm just looking for reassurance, or others who have had a similar experience here. I don't terribly mind not having many friends here (and no close ones), but it makes me feel like an outcast and as if I'm doing something very wrong when I see everyone with close-knit groups of friends. I'd like to have a few close friends that I can see often, but instead I have few kinda distant friends that I see rarely.

I do make an effort with people, and these are the people I call my friends (and who I tell my roommate I'm out with when I am only a small fraction of the time). I have maybe 5 people I meet up with or talk to once a month or every two months. It's really easy to fake it on social media tho haha.

My mind always drifts to how people are super busy but still make time for their friends. I try my best to make an effort to hang out with people, but I try to limit it for fear of being overbearing/clingy (and I also don't always want to be the only one asking to hang out). Of course I want to see certain people way more often than I do, but I genuinely have no idea how to go about doing this when for almost two years, we've seen each other only occasionally. 

If anyone has any experiences to share or general social advice, please do! It makes me feel better to know I'm not alone in feeling alone. And of course, feel free to PM me with anything (pls)!"

I transferred here last semester from a Podunk college.

To be honest, they treat the students terribly here in general. Everything is a competition due to lack of resources. I see an attitude that it makes the students ""tough"" or whatever.  No, it just stresses everyone out.

* Even going to the gym is a pain. At my old college there was 1/4 the students, but the gym was twice as large. The gym is so full half the time here I can't even use it. It would be better if a ton of the equipment wasn't out of order.
* Going to L&amp;S advising feels like I'm going to the DMV. 
* We have to compete to even get into classes. Want to late add an easy gen-ed? HA
* I'm in CS 61A this semester. (A class with \~1800? students) For some reason the first test is scheduled from 8-10 pm. That late is totally absurd.

None of these things are a huge deal in themselves, but they add up real quick.

Berkeley doesn't really seem to care that stuff like this causes a stressful environment for the students. Why would they?.

We're over enrolled, and there'd be 100 people willing to take your place and put up with this stuff because we're ""Prestigious"".

Lectures here tend to be below par. My experience with GSI's has been mostly terrible. (Probably in part because they are overworked). So in my experience, most of the time you are on your own to learn stuff.

The difference in the educational quality you receive here and your average state university comes down to that here you are graded on curve against other really smart students.

We help tutors and students connect with each other online.

One of our students reached out to me the other day and asked me why there was nothing about us on Reddit - I jokingly replied: that’s a good thing, isn’t it?

I use reddit every day (from my personal account) and couldn’t decide if I should make a post about the company or not. In the end I decided to go through with it and write a relatively short post as some people might find it useful.

The company was founded in 2005 by a chemistry professor, he had many ties to academia, so he had developed a network of academics with graduate-level degrees in their fields of study.

Since 2005 we’ve connected more than one million college students with top academic tutors in 300+ subject areas. 

We offer one-on-one online sessions (using our state-of-the-art, HTML5 tutoring platform) and step-by-step written solutions/guidelines. 

There are no monthly fees or minimums, our tutors provide students with a price and directly negotiate with them.

We work with both domestic and international students and tutors.

This might sound very corny, but we take pride in good quality help that we provide – we’re not perfect mind you, but we do our best and we care about our students and tutors.

Quite often we have students that are falling behind due to some family emergency, health issues or language barriers. They could also be working full time or they could be single parents enrolled to adult studies. All of these cases (and others) can’t seem to catch a break and it’s almost impossible for them to get back on track.

In the end, when they reach out to us (or to our tutors) and thank us wholeheartedly for the help they have received, it melts my freakin’ heart, especially since some of their stories pack a punch and are not for the faint-hearted.

Hey Berkeley reddit! (This is gonna be all over the place so I apologize in advance)

Planning on starting a team on campus that Berkeley has never had before. In fact, except for one other university, no college in America has this sort of team. Most people would have never heard of it, but it combines the most iconic aspects of school spirit into one, so I want to bring that uniqueness to Berkeley!

Apologies for keeping things vague, will explain that later. What I need from reddit though is a couple of friends who have some time this semester and are looking to start a legacy!

You'd be a perfect fit if:

\- You want to get involved on campus and have your presence known! The goal is to represent our school with pride, and to make our school proud in return 

\- You like to dance! Specifically if your style is upbeat, peppy, and/or cutesy. It's a specific form of monement though, but it can be taught; the most important thing is that you have a passion for performing!

\- You have a lot of time in your schedule to spend on meeting up; this team is gonna be built from the ground up so we as founders are gonna need some time to get our show rolling

\- You have an awesome personality!!! But seriously, if you're kind-hearted, respectful, dedicated, willing to just have fun with the team, then you're a perfect fit. Yes, the main aspect of this team is to display skill and ability but a sweet person with two left feet will be chosen over a mean Beyonce any day.

On that note, this is not ACTUALLY a dance team........ Or is it? I don't want to give too many details but it's a certain KIND of dance. Visuals are the most important part so it involves a great deal of showmanship, crowd engagement, and grace. Also, cute uniforms. You (hopefully) won't know what it is until you ask though! 

If you're interested and wanna find out, send me a message! You can also email me at new.berkeley.squad@gmail.com 

Thanks for your time!"

About to get myself guillotined here but wanted to share some thoughts on international students in my program at UCB. I’m a graduate student in a technical school at Berkeley in which at least 50% of the student body is from India. These students are literally only doing the program to get a visa to work at a major tech company in the United States, and the program largely serves as a degree mill for their purposes. If you ask them, many will tell you that this is their intention verbatim, to your face. A public university is investing massive amounts of money to get these guys and girls jobs and housing in the Bay.

At the same time, the housing crisis is getting worse and worse in the Bay Area. The cost of living is becoming unaffordable, and everyday people have to deal with it. I see now people who likely had regular lives, girls with their hair still with the highlights from when they saw the stylist last, forced to live in the streets. The social system to support everyday Americans living in the Bay Area is nothing short of abominable.  

My question is - why is your taxpayer money being spent to finance a degree mill that gets foreign nationals housing and employment in the Bay Area, to the disadvantage of the people who already live there? Why are there so few services to bring the poor up? This would be one thing if we were bringing people in to stimulate the economy and create new jobs for people, but that’s not what’s happening. It simply brings in foreign nationals to make the housing crisis worse.

I hope this can spark a productive conversation, and perhaps a discussion on what can be done. I don’t have anything against foreign nationals, and in fact like many of them personally, but I just think the system is set up to make everything worse."

In January last year, me and a mate were walking along Shattuck, when we came across a food truck. We were pretty hungry, so we brought some food there on a whim. 

We both bought a double bacon cheeseburger (excessive, I know) and it was probably the best thing either of us had ever tasted. Perfection between two buns. 

In the year since, we’ve looked everywhere for the truck, but with no real results. Could anyone help point us in the right direction? 

The truck was very basic looking (not branded or gourmet like a lot of the other food trucks around here, just plain silver) and sold primarily Mexican cuisine, with a couple of additions to the menu such as fries and the aforementioned cheeseburger. 

It was parked outside the fiat dealership and Chrysler Dodge Jeep dealership  (across the way from Kirala) when we found it. We found it around noon. 

Any help to point us in the right direction would be fantastic

Thanks in advance- we’ll post an update if we end up getting our hands on it once again"

2) Does getting into a consulting/business club increase your chances of getting a job or whatever? Like not directly, of course, but indirectly?

I just signed up at the Y, but the only thing I have ever done at a gym is cardio. I’m trying to shed a few pounds, but more importantly I want to build some muscle. 

The problem is that I don’t know where to even start. I’m a bit intimidated of just going into the weight room and not knowing what I’m doing.

Does anyone workout here? Would you be interested in helping me out?

Comment or pm me!

Any advice helps! Thank you"

I came in with some stats experience from the Math 10 series as Stat 20, and some programming experience in R (Psych 101 and Stat 20). I did well in Psych 101 (but that class has huge grade inflation, at least with Catterson) and got a B+ in Stat 20.

So far, Data 8 has honestly been hard for me. Or at least harder than I'd like it to be. Lab 1 and HW 1 were pretty doable, but I needed more help than I would've liked with Lab 2 (the lab TA's had to break down concepts for me and give me hints). 

HW 2 was also pretty hard, especially when it came to creating tables and some parts in Question 5--a TA in OH literally had to explain things to me multiple times before I got to a solution. 

I think part of it is that I was rushing through the homework and didn't have time to figure out things for myself as well as the fact that I'm not up to date on the textbook readings. 

I've asked multiple TA's what typical signs are that Data 8 will be hard, and all of them gave me really optimistic takings like ""You're in OH and you got all the way to Q5 on the homework, you're gonna be fine!"" when I really don't feel that way inside. I felt like I had no idea what I was doing. 

I even told a TA after she had to totally break down a problem to me that ""Jeez, I really need to brush up on my Python table references"" and she was all like ""No it's fine this is all new!"" 

I think part of it is that I'm swamped (or just really shitty at managing time) with other classes like Chem 3B and 2 other econ classes as well as pre-existing clinical depression/anxiety managing stress about picking between business and premed. 

I'm wondering if I should drop Data 8 and possibly save it for later, but in the meantime I wanted to hear takes on what signs there are that Data 8 will be rough (i.e. I'll get a B or lower in the class)."

I'm am pursuing to double major in physics and data science. In order to declare DS, I have to take data8 over the summer( I have already took 61A on the Fall, B+, and am taking 61B this semester). I was originally thinking of taking only physics 111A this summer but I saw that the lectures and lab time of Data 8 and physics 111A were not overlapping this summer so I was thinking of giving it a try. 

I did hear that physics 111A was a huge time-consuming monster and it is highly recommended to only take that class during the summer semester, but I also just want to get over with declaring DS by taking data 8 on the summer. 

I'm pretty sure Data 8 will be really easy if I took 61A and 61B, but do you think it is wise to do physics 111A and Data 8 at the same time?"

For the past 3 semesters, I've been on Tinder on and off.  I saw so many cute girls on the app. I guess this shouldn't be surprising because I see so many cute girls on campus, so probably it's just a representation of that translated into online pool. I wasn't swiping right on every girl cuz I knew that would just fuck up my rating and my profile would just sink in the blackhole my profile wouldn't appear on anyone's swipe. So I was carefully swiping on the girls who seemed either really friendly or just fairly attractive, but who still felt like within my reach. However, I was not getting any match. Could it have been my bio? I didn't have anything weird or off-color comment written on my bio. Yet, I would get like 1 or 2 matches here and there on some day, but usually it was with girls who seemed a little over-weight and just not attractive at all. I was thinking, ""why am I not getting matches with any single cute girl I swiped right?"". I started to become frustrated and tried to get a fresh start by deleting my account and creating new account, but literally nothing changed. Same experience over and over again, kept getting likes from only unattractive girls. 

Then, came this thought. Could it be because I'm not attractive? Tbh, I'm probably a 3 or 4. I'm short with fairly ugly face. So I started to wonder. What would Tinder be like for an attractive guy? So I created a fake profile with a quite cute Asian guy photo. Guess what. As soon as I started swiping, I would get almost instant matches with all these cute asian girls. Even some white girls too. I was just in awe... I couldn't believe my eyes. Then some of these girls even initiated a conversation, which NEVER happened to me when I was using my real profile. Then when this asian girl messaged me, I replied with something like ""Do you wanna grab a boba tonight?"" and she replied with ""Yea sure, but I like Soju(Korean liquor) more!"". So I was like ""I have Soju! Did you just wanna drink then?"" and I wanted to see what would her reaction be so I even pushed it further and asked, ""Can I come over to your place then?"" and she was like, ""yea sure! My place is a little messy, but if you don't mind, you can come over :)"". I couldn't just believe my eyes... How could something like this be so easy? When I was barely getting matches with any girl with my real profile, a very cute girl literally willing to just have me over to her place when she barely doesn't even know me?

How could be something that I work so hard to get be so easy for some people? yea, I know it's life.. but man... that was really disheartening experience and ever since then I just started to become super bitter about pretty much everything. People keep saying personality is what matters but how can I even date someone when girls don't even give me chance to show my personality cuz I'm not attractive? I know there's an exception. Yes, I've seen an ugly guy with a really pretty girl, but that's really rare. I feel like I'm just doomed to fail and never gonna be able to date a cute girl.. What do I even do? Is there any way to get over this bitterness...?"

Now for my main problem: I feel like I'm just working to pay rent, and nothing else. I've been sleeping horribly because I just think of how I'll be able to pay for next month's rent when I barely make \~$150 a week. I've been saving every single coin that I own, I always use AC Transit (making it a 2 hr commute), I usually shop at ReUse ($3 clothes), I go to food bank and I don't eat out (not even McD's, which frankly baffled me when I saw the price of a cheeseburger). But when I walk out towards Downtown, my eyes can't help but water with hunger and sadness at those warm foods. 

This probably sounds like a shitty rant from a naive student, but how can I save money living in the Bay?

We have a semesterly print magazine as well as a website that is updated every few days with content ranging from club activities and Berkeley news to fashion advice, movie reviews, college humor, and opinion pieces. The staff is super chill and easygoing, and you can literally write on/photograph anything you want.

We meet for 1 hour on Tuesdays at 8pm, but some weeks meetings are not mandatory. If you would like to be a part of Caliber but are busy Tuesdays at 8pm, arrangements can definitely be made so you can still keep in touch via email/meeting with editors. We do not require participants to spend any money -- most photographers do already have their own camera and get reimbursed for any film purchased for Caliber purposes. We provide all other resources.

Application is due Tuesday February 11th. Apply here!!! [https://www.calibermag.net/join](https://www.calibermag.net/join)"

&amp;#x200B;

I’m a US Army veteran that is interested in applying for Berkeley's Computer Science graduate program. 

&amp;#x200B;

I’m currently taking the recommended courses listed on this website: [https://eecs.berkeley.edu/academics/graduate/recommended-coursework](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/academics/graduate/recommended-coursework) as a non-degree seeking student. 

&amp;#x200B;

After that, I wish to attend a school with a strong COMPSCI program that boosts my chances of getting accepted into Berkeley grad school. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a very limited list of candidates at the moment, but I’m willing to discard them if they’re not prestigious enough according to Berkeley. As of now, Florida University is leading the list (since I live in Florida) followed by Miami University.

&amp;#x200B;

Would Berkeley consider applicants from these schools? If not, which universities typically feed your grad school program? 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that recommendation letters, past research and a high GPA are the biggest factors, but I’m assuming high GPAs from certain universities are more valuable according to Berkeley's standards. 

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I’d be willing to relocate if necessary, or take online classes. I’ve heard The University of Georgia has a great online option for students out of state.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your time!"

Hey y’all,

I just moved to Berkeley last month and I’ve been feeling fairly lonely, and I’m not sure how I can meet new people. I just graduated from school (UCSD) last year, moved up here for work, but I’m not sure where people go in Berkeley to make friends, since I don’t know anyone here to ask. I have a few thoughts:

1. Some type of location I can go to (store, cafe, idk)

2. Some type of event in the city 

3. OR something at UC Berkeley...but since I’m not a student idk if that’s OK. I don’t want to waltz into a club or campus event and then get kicked out because i don’t go to school there. If it’s OK, this would be the easiest option.

Please let me know if anyone has ideas!"

At Cal, that manifests as getting as much work experience as I can, networking, and getting good grades, I guess?

Essentially, what I'm trying to say is that while I'm (trying) to actively work towards a better future for myself, I often fail to enjoy the present because I'm so anxious about life after college.

I was just accepted to EECS + Business MET '24. Super excited! The program seems to encompass everything I could possibly dream of studying in college. I've not yet had the chance to chat with an actual MET student though, and am curious to hear some current students' perspectives. Here are the many questions I have about the program -- they're a lot, but if you guys could answer any for me, I'd be eternally grateful! It's not particularly easy to find first-hand information about MET online. Thank you guys so much!

\----

First off, do you like MET? 

How time-consuming is the MET workload? 

Do you find time to work on your own businesses during the school year, despite what I assume is a pretty hefty workload (though please correct me if this assumption is false)? Is it feasible to balance MET + personal business venture + social life?

Do MET students often collaborate with each other to launch entrepreneurial ventures?

Do many MET alumni end up working industry jobs, or do they do other things? Is there any kind of vocational skew post-MET?

What practical technical skills will you learn studying EECS under MET? (web dev? C++? Arduino? etc.) How much freedom do you have to explore different areas within CS?

What do you study as part of the business side of MET?

As a MET student, is it possible to fit in outside courses that don't fall under the business / CS umbrella into your Berkley schedule? Or are basically all your classes going to be from these two areas exclusively.

Thank you so much in advance! Can't wait to join Berkley '24!"

I just received notice today that I got accepted into UC Berkeley with an offer to be interviewed for the Regents Scholarship!! YAY So excited!! But, I did have a few concerns that it would be great if answered. I got accepted into the L&amp;S program BTW and planning on majoring in CS.

1) I want to become a CS Major; however, I heard that in order to declare CS Major at Berkeley, you need to meet a minimum GPA for 3 introductory CS classes. How hard/competitive is it to meet this GPA cap? And are they moving up this cap for next year?

2) Is the stereotyped cutthroat Berkeley environment real, especially for CS? How much time will I have to balance my studies and social life?

3) How useful is the Regents Scholarship? 

4) Is anyone from the Bay Area? Do you guys feel like another college would have helped diversify your environment and do you ever feel like Berkeley is too close to home?

Thanks so much in advance for answering these questions! Means a lot!!"

Business frats, and including Theta Tau, are some of the worst and most toxic organizations on UC Berkeley's campus and having previously been a part of one of them, I can most confidently say that NO ONE should be subject to the treatment you go through in the pledging process of these ""organizations"". Now that I've graduated, I feel a lot more comfortable sharing my experiences and the underground process of brutal mental and physical hazing that is worse than any social frat on this campus. 

**Mental &amp; Physical Hazing:** Imagine that being berated, yelled at, forced to wake up at 4am-8am after sleeping at sometime between 2am-3am, and humiliated many days for 7-9 straight weeks. That is the hell that pledging involves. You are given quizzes on the brothers, the chapter, the pledge class, random professional topics from engineering to math to business, and more randomly throughout the week and if you fail them you are threatened each and every single time with the risk of being ""kicked out"". 

This mindset forces you to focus on pledging and ""the process"" for an incredibly taxing amount of time and the frats act as if the process is equally as important, if not even more important than school and the classes you take. (This is especially true with the business frats). They yell at you for failing, and when you try to leave they will always attempt to hold you back and manipulate you to stay only so they can mentally abuse you. At a certain point, they stop caring about your grades and your difficult your life is; they are so power hungry and caught up on pledging you and breaking down your mental stability all for the point making you become a ""brother"" in their ""exclusive organization"". You are also given pointless tasks, under the false vision that there is a reason for things like fundraising and selling shit like Chic-Fil-A and In-n-Out on Sproul for a fake purpose (Yes they do that, take a closer look at the orgs fundraising during the semester next time), as part of pledging. Furthermore, they will also assign you work and random tasks for the sole purpose of their own enjoyment that will force you to sacrifice not only your time, but your sleep, health, grades, etc.

Not only that, but many times you are put in situations where you are pressured in to drinking; BAP &amp; Theta Tau are especially known for making their pledges drink alcohol during events as a part of ""wet"" hazing. DSP/Rho was also heavy on drinking until pledges LITERALLY became injured and their process was exposed by the university due to their usage of the berkeley email domain (which is why they rebranded as Rho are underground nowadays). DSP/Rho is a very very dangerous organization. 

UC Berkeley generally turns its shoulders to this literal abuse of students. Please reach out if you have any questions. I personally used to be in one of the ""lower"" business frats and although the process wasn't that bad; I've realized how horrible it is and how most people just let it happen. This needs to change."

I'm currently a second year here at Berkeley studying EECS and I've definitely hit a low point in my life. Despite having my mental health mostly under control for the past couple of years, since last semester it has slowly deteriorated to the point where I just feel like I can't keep going on. Dealing with obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, and constant anxiety has just left me to a point of feeling weak and hopeless. I've been reaching out to therapists and psychiatrists to help me get back on track (hopefully, fingers crossed), but until I get that figured out I'm kind of just in limbo.

My schedule this semester isn't too crazy, only 12 units: CS 70, Data 8, and Philosophy R1B. I wanted to take a relatively ""easy"" semester so I could focus on my own sanity and such. Data 8 and Philosophy R1B are fairly manageable, but CS 70 with Sahai is snowballing due to my declining mental health and I'm at a loss as to what to do. I haven't been able to complete the last two homework assignments (used my homework drops) and I'm just getting flashbacks to my last encounter with Sahai. A year ago (Spring 2019), I took EE16B with Sahai, and basically the same thing happened. I turned in almost none of the homework assignments (resubmitted them for partial credit) and failed just about all of the exams... the only thing keeping me afloat was the lab portion of the class, so I did pass. Anyways, I thought I had escaped the wrath of Sahai, but here I am taking CS 70 with him again.

What should I do? I'm worried that another EE16B situation is going to unfold and I really don't want to be dealing with that for the rest of the semester. I was contemplating dropping CS 70 so I could take it another semester (or over the summer) when I am hopefully in a better mental state, but is that even possible to do? Since I'm only taking 12 units right now, if I were to drop CS 70 I'd be at 8 units, which is clearly below the threshold for being a full-time student. In addition, if I were to drop CS 70, I don't even think I'd have a replacement class to take at this point. For the College of Engineering, you have to be enrolled in at least two technicals... I'm not even sure where I would get another technical from. I'm just lost.

My apologies if this post doesn't have much coherency, I just really needed to speak my mind. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, and please feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk about anything. Making friends here at Berkeley has been tough for me, so I'm always open to talk to others. Thank you. &lt;3"

f20els,CS 70 and Linear Algebra,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/f20els/cs_70_and_linear_algebra/,abigfailure1,1,2020-02-10 17:03:11,17,/r/berkeley/comments/f20els/cs_70_and_linear_algebra/,NaN,"I am so frustrated right now with CS 70. 

I took the course last semester but emergency dropped bc I bombed the second midterm, but I essentially followed along and wanted to retake the course so I can have another shot at declaring CS. All is fine, I thought. I assumed it would be easier for me to grasp concepts the second time around, but even if I don't make it, I could move on giving it my best shot.

Then along comes Sahai... people say he's just trying to scare students with the mathematical maturity talk, but nope. Somehow, a course that I essentially took last semester now requires linear algebra. This course had little to no linear algebra last semester. I have no idea what to do because I haven't taken EE16A or B, or any linear algebra course for that matter. Now, I understand that it might help you become better at math to take these classes, but it's never been a part of the 70 curriculum. And frankly, it's pretty rude to assume everyone taking 70 has taken EE, which is what Sahai actually said-- that it's EXPECTED you have taken it. NOWHERE in the prereqs did it say you have to take those classes. Not everyone taking 70 is a CS major!!! There is actually no point in adding linear algebra other than to just fuck with people who haven't taken it and disadvantage them.

I assumed he was trying to scare people on HW0 with the random linear algebra questions after providing no review/lesson on this, but on HW2, he put a WHOLE question on proofs about Gaussian elimination that required a legitimate understanding of linear algebra (it's also the question worth the most points on the HW!!). Obviously, I was fucked on this question. Now, it's becoming clear he really wants to make sure people who haven't taken linear algebra can't fully succeed in this course. I know plenty of people who didn't take linear algebra and did really well in previous semesters (maybe because the course DIDN'T HAVE ANY LINEAR ALGEBRA). 

I'm feeling screwed now. I can't put off 70 yet again. In fact, it's too late for me to really swap into another technical (and I wouldn't know what to take because I don't even have a major yet technically).  And also I can't put off declaring; I'm already worried about graduating on time without stuffing too many upper div technical courses per semester later. I feel that it's incredibly unfair that he's changing things and adding linear algebra. Now, if he puts it on exams, I'm actually fucked completely. I don't know what to do, but I just hate the fact that my chances of success in this course could be destroyed simply because I don't know linear algebra?? Anyone else in the same/similar boat?"

I’m a candidate for M. Arch graduate program in the fall, and considering where I should live. The interesting part is that my husband currently works in the South Bay, so basically opposite from Berkeley. The major options I can see are these:

-Both live in SF, he can take the work shuttle and I can take the BART
-Live somewhere in East Bay, again would have to find a spot where we can take BART and shuttle, maybe Hayward (he’s willing to drive if it’s under 40 min)
-Live separately in two crappy tiny places; this is obviously for economics, but we wouldn’t want to pay two whole rents so we’d both be close to work/school and see each other on weekends

We currently live in Burlingame, where I commute north to the city and he commutes south. It’s a bit too far to commute from Millbrae though. I’m willing to put up with a bit of a commute, but the real kicker is that with an M.Arch there are typically a lot of late nights and weird schedules. I don’t want to get stuck at school with nowhere to sleep. At the same time, I could be one of those students who puts a hard deadline on when it’s time to go home. It’s not the culture, but I would keep my sanity. What do you guys think? Any M.Arch or commuter M.Arch students who could weigh in?"

I can spend $100 on a date and still not be reciprocated with rightfully deserved sex. ive come to the conclusion that asian males on this campus are simply despised, loathsome creatures in the eyes of society at large, and particularly from the view of asian girls. asian girls here give up their pussies to inferior, stupid, brutish men who have no place in an intellectual atmosphere such as UC Berkeley. i believe this is due to a number of reasons, mainly having to do with the westernization and whitewashing of asian culture, which turns most asian girls into brainless sluts that will bang any white chad they can get their hands on. we need to prevent future generations of asians from being corrupted by the fucked up morals and mentality of american culture.

Oh yes, and a picture of me shortly before  I spent $100 on my last date

I got a 9.5.  Looks like I won't be skipping any more discussion sections.  

Just fyi for anyone in a similar situation, here's the formula for point recovery:

 **def** **exam\_recovery**(your\_exam\_score, attendance, max\_exam\_score, cap=10):    

 half\_score = max\_exam\_score / 2     #Midterm 1 had 40 points, so if you scored below 20, you can   
\#recover points

max\_recovery = max(0, (half\_score - your\_exam\_score) / 2)    #Since I scored 9.5 points, I can get

\#10.5/2 or 5.25 maximum recovery points     

recovery\_ratio = min(attendance, cap) / cap                            #Cap is 10 classes.  If I attend 10 classes, I   
\#get all 5.25 points

**return** max\_recovery \* recovery\_ratio 

So, basically, attend at least 10 discussions for max recovery points.  Since I scored 9.5, I can get 5 max recovery points if I attend 10 discussion."

I hesitate to do this since next year will probably be my final year, and I really didn't want to stress out about wondering whether or not I will get into the class. Especially since this is a required class for me (MLDM, I'm a dual CS/DS major).  With my luck, as a 3rd year, I'll probably get waitlisted at #500 by the time I register.   I had Sahai for EE16B, thought he was tolerable, but I was focused on getting past CS70 so I didn't put too much effort into his class.  

Also, that would mean I would switch and take 162 in the Fall, which might be an ugly combination since I have to (re)take 61C (should be a lot easier the second time around with Garcia, I panicked and emergency dropped his class last semester when I didn't have to) and possibly/probably 176 and 168.

We're talking single digits, just shy of a 10. I'm really scared for myself and my future and I don't know if I'm just frazzled from my result or if it's because of my past experience.

I am on academic probation and am only taking two other four units (both humanities focused) and a seminar. I took Data 8 last semester and barely passed. I had prior experience with Python (but pretty minor and a long time ago). I don't hate programming, I like it, I can find fun in it, but everything about this class is making me question everything I know about coding, and whether I actually like it or not. I'm afraid that the rigor of coding classes in this school will make me sour on programming. (I think I did okay-ish on the projects and homework so far for 61a, for reference)

I don't know what else I'm interested in. My parents say ""well, you should pursue data science because you will make good money off of it"" and it's true, but pursuing something just based on money doesn't seem good. I do want to pursue data science for non-money reasons (but it is there on my mind). And since I got a C- on Data 8, well, am I really cut out for that major? With a C-? Won't people laugh at me for ""passing but really it seems like failing"" one of the most important major requirements? And to be honest, going up to my parents and telling them ""I don't want to do this"" feels just as bad as me failing 61a, probably because they both mean the same thing. They would probably tell me ""Well, get the Econ major ready! If you can't program, then you can still get that bread by accounting or measuring how much money a person's life is worth."" (I have not taken any classes related to the above quote). I should tell you all that I am not a math person, but I don't inherently hate it nor do I think that because I had very bad experiences with math (Math 1B, I'm looking at you) that automatically means that I will always do bad at math. Growth mindset and all that (but sometimes I can't maintain my belief in that, that's a whole 'nother story).

Everyone makes declaring a major and pursuing a career something that you have to wholeheartedly love. I have found things that I like well enough, but nothing that I love, that I want to fill out a form for and take dedicated classes in. Is that really a thing? Do you have to go into college and come out of it wholly loving a thing, and then that means it's easier to get a job out of it if you love it?

Yes, I am a first year, but after this semester there's a quarter of my college years gone!  There are things that I take an interest in, I took a few language classes that are taught in English, and I like the subjects, but I don't like them enough to take classes to learn the language, except maybe Chinese, because that's my parents' native language and I'm interested. I liked English and History from a young age. I have been told that pursuing these majors makes it hard to get a well-paying job in this day and age. I think those people are right, but please tell me if I'm wrong.

Frankly, I don't want to drop, because I don't know what kind of classes are still available now (I'll probably hate them), and I still have some hope that I can turn things around...somehow...if I work on my habits, get (a) tutor(s), get out of my fucking isolation. But I don't know if I can. It's too comfortable to just relax, ""work"" on my other classes, go to club events and such. And that academic probation mark on CalCentral is hanging over my head like the goddamn sword of Damocles.

someone help."

At 3pm, the exam was finished but a GSI announced that students who got their exam late could follow another GSI to another room in order to finish with a bit more time.

Obviously when an exam ends, students always discuss questions and answers, usually comparing specific numerical answers. This means the students who were not yet finished with the exam, whether they wanted to or not, heard answers that other students discussed. In addition, there are a few students I saw and likely many more that I did not see, who went into the other room for extra time despite not receiving their exam late.

Is there a history of anything happening as a result of something like this, or will the exam just stand as it normally would, ruining the curve for students who did not cheat? I just wanted to bring attention to this to gather other students' opinions and because I find it very bruh."

Not bad for how long it was sitting in my backpack. It had a bruise from my water bottle and having been in my backpack while skating, so it was a rough ride. Overall, not too shabby, though another day may have made it the perfect shade of yellow.

Ease of peeling: 9
Easy and to peel, top came off with a nice snap, got a tiny little bit of that thing where the sides stuck together but not bad.

Smell: 8
Very fragrant and floral, nice smell but I could tell it was a n00b. If it was a day older then the smell would have been a little sweeter and that much better

Taste: 8
First bite was a little disappointing. It tasted a little bit underripe and I could tell. After that, it really grew on me. Good tasting 'nana. The aftertaste is really where this bad boy shines. The subtleties make you pay attention

Mouthfeel: 9
This is a big one for me. The texture was fantastic. Nice and firm, but not so firm that it stands out as underripe. From the first bite I could tell it was gonna be a good ride. It's at that sweet spot where you don't have to bite all the way through but breaking off the chunk in your mouth doesn't accidentally break off more than you want. The ONLY detractor here was a very very slight chalkiness that I wasn't crazy about. Overall, very enjoyable experience.

Price: 3
I got this banana for 95¢ and that is way too much for a banana. I did use flex points so I guess that's nice but this could have been way cheaper. I meant to post this a while ago but I decided to wait to verify the price because I was in disbelief. Good banana but still...


Overall, I'd give this banana an 6. The appearance left a lot to be desired, but this is one that put function over form, and it really shows. It was a good size, maybe could have used another day to push it up in taste, but regardless, I would eat this banana again. The main thing bringing this down to a six was the price. I just can't justify getting a banana for that price. I'm sure trader Joe's or Target has comparable ones for way less. Such a shame that a banana of this caliber is being pushed down this low.

Hope you all enjoyed."

And they know that it was the Montgomery bus boycott that ignited a certain kind of Southern civil rights movement,” says Ula Taylor, a professor in the Department of African American Studies at UC Berkeley. But, what they might not know, she says, is that it was actually the behind-the-scenes organizing effort by the Women’s Political Council, led by Jo Ann Robinson, that made the boycott successful.

i just got accepted to cal like a week ago and have been going thru a real mixed bag of emotions. i’m a closeted trans guy, theatre-art-social-justice focused and majored, and have old and sick indian immigrant parents. all of these reasons are why i’m so torn on whether to stay near home (LA) or go far up north. i want to go out and explore my queerness and feel free enough to not be hindered by my family, but i’m terrified of leaving them behind because they aren’t well anymore and i feel like i need to stay closer to home. theatre and art and social justice is what SF and cal are known for and thats what is meant for me, but LA has so many business opportunities as well plus i have home field advantage. 

i’m so, so extremely torn because if i make the wrong decision, i don’t know that i’ll have anything to fall back on. i didnt even consider berkeley as an option until i got in and now that it’s an option, my world has kind of gone upside down...it’s not an end of the world situation but it’s a major life choice that i have no clue how to attack. i even made a pros and cons list, which has turned out to be incredibly useless :\

kind of word vom essay, srry about that but can anyone give me any kind of advice?? or maybe you can share about your experience with student life at berkeley?? if you’re a theatre/art major, could you also share your experience?

Could be anything from old Berkeley urban legends to something as mundane as seeing something strange on campus at night. 

I was inspired to make this thread because I was just told a rather frightening tale by a friend of mine. She was traveling back to her Unit 1 dorm from Soda Hall at around 1:50 AM in the morning, having just left a project meeting. The friends she was working with all lived at Foothill, so they went their separate ways at the crosswalk near Cory Hall. When she crossed the crosswalk near Cory, she felt an eerie feeling which prompted her to glance over her shoulder. She noticed a figure behind her, standing still, back near the 4th floor entrance to Soda Hall (the one opposite of the breezeway entrance). The figure was of immense height, easily 6'5. This sighting didn't phase her at first but she kept its presence in the back of her mind, and generally felt a little creeped out. She made her way down the hill, towards Sutardja Dai, and decided to go down the stairway that leads to the V&amp;A cafe and into inner campus. When she had descended all the stairs and reached the area with the outdoor seating for the cafe, she felt the eerie feeling again and glanced over her shoulder once more. The large figure was now atop the stairs in front of the entrance to Sutardja Dai Hall, staring down at her. At this, my friend was panicked. This unknown large figure had been following her and there was no one around help. She froze like deer in headlights, transfixed at this large figure began to make large, almost comically long strides toward her. As it drew closer, its features began to become more apparent. The figure was a tall man wearing a button-up shirt with jeans. A laptop bag slung from his neck, and his glasses reflected the little light from the campus streetlights overheard. My now shaking, paralyzed friend observed a curled smirk etched into the man's face as he drew yet closer. Once he was 10 feet away from her, he stopped his advance suddenly. He stared at her for a few seconds more and finally spoke just a single word: "" *AnNouncements* "". At this, my friend lost it. Galvanized by pure terror and adrenaline, she full on sprinted past Evans, towards the Campanile and continued to run down the hill to Wheeler. Once she made it to Sather Gate, she collapsed from mixture of exhaustion and panic. Luckily, some other students who also happened to live in Unit 1 were walking by as she fell and were able to carry her back the rest of the way. I don't know what happened that night or who that person was, but I'm sure just glad nothing bad happened to my friend."

have no idea what major I want to do now and that combined with recent major life events means ive kinda just stayed in my bed this entire weekend crying.

is there any way I can get some sort of therapy appointment (preferably soon?? i know tang center has scheduled appointments but if they’re only available like 2+ weeks in advance I wouldn’t bother)


I also don’t have SHIP since I’m on my parent’s insurance, but they’re really against therapy and have access to what appointments I schedule since my account is still connected to theirs, and I can’t separate it without having stuff mailed back home which I... obviously don’t have access to since I’m at college lol"

I visited on my own and might have missed key elements of the building, but it was underwhelming compared to the rest of campus. Additionally I peeked in at the studios and bathrooms, and not gonna lie it was depressing af. The good point is there are plenty of windows for daylight and views I guess.

A good friend of mine, unfortunately, flunked out of Berkeley a few years ago because of health-related reasons. Ever since that happened they have been unmotived and stagnant in our dreary town. I've tried my best to encourage them to reach out for themselves but my attempts have all failed and I can tell that they are starting to resent me for trying. I can empathize with them but it pains me to see my brilliant friend Just waist away in our dead-end town.  
My friend was studying integrative biology and doing very well until their illness reared its ugly head and affected their studies. My friend doesn't want to admit it but they have a legitimate handicap and I know the school would accommodate. All UC's have programs that help people with disabilities I know this because my school UC Santa Cruz had one. However, my friend was too proud or embarrassed or whatever, but they did not take advantage of said programs. As far as the school sees it they're just a dropout.

  
There is a bit more to the story that I could get into to but for brevity reasons I want to keep it short. Feel free to ask questions if clarification is needed. However, what I want to know is who or where should I contact to get more information on how to clear up this mess? My friend feels hopeless, Berkeley was their dream school and all this talent is just wasting away. The probability of getting readmitted seems pretty much nonexistent, well that's what my friend says, they don't see the point. But what the hell at least give it a try that's what I say.

  
Any help would be much appreciated.   


Cheers."

(prospective math/CS major at MIT),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/f5vslg/should_i_take_cs_61a_over_the_summer_prospective/,throwawayberkeleymit,1,2020-02-18 09:58:12,12,/r/berkeley/comments/f5vslg/should_i_take_cs_61a_over_the_summer_prospective/,NaN,"(I apologize in advance if this is not the right place to post this. Please do let me know if this is the case.) I am a high school senior that was recently accepted to MIT, and I am planning to major in math or CS there. I haven't decided yet, mostly because I am interested in CS, but have very little experience in it compared to in math. My CS experience is fairly minimal - USACO Silver and taking AP CS right now - that's about it.     

So I was thinking that I could take CS 61A over the summer to try to ""catch up"" a little in terms of experience. I was thinking that taking 61A would possibly (1) help me decide whether I actually want to major in CS and (2) give me a better foundation because with my current experience, I would likely be a little (or very?) behind at MIT if I do decide to major in CS. At the same time, I feel like this is my last real break and I should have some more fun (travel?). Also, I'm not too sure how hard it is to get an A in this course.    

I would love to get some current students' thoughts on this. How helpful do you think this class would be for me and is it worth sacrificing my last break for? Thank you!"

Saw that CS C8 is full for Summer, but STAT C8 is open. I am a community college cross-enrollment student in Fall/Spring, visiting in Summer. Intended majors are CS and CogSci, and I know that it isn't required, and I will be taking CS 61AC &amp; 47B anyway after transfer.

Data Science for AI and sociology of the internet interests me and isn't offered in CC. Took STAT 2, fluent beginning in Python, Git, Linux. Taking the EdX version now, will be done by Summer.

Should I be good? Considering taking CS/STAT 88, STAT 89A, 140, and maybe upper-division DS after transfer, in addition to CS 188, 189, et cetera. DS also has industry applications, and I have a lot of friends in tech, which is good given the job market for PhDs in CogSci or related research.

Also, will taking 2 upper-division courses over Summers impact my ability to transfer to Berkeley? It's not clear, so I am only planning on low-division for 2020, but will def ace LINGUIS 100 etc based on the syllabus.

Thanks y'all!"

Friends,

I’m a cal alum, and I started a [thing](http://www.cherieorganic.com/). I am giving away subscriptions for up to lifetime of organic period goods at wholesale cost to Cal students (saves you up to $6/mo on organic period care). If you’re interested, you can pre-order your first 3 months at wholesale cost here (starts at $7/mo). It’ll ship out in April.

Cancel anytime. Try it risk free. Hate it? We’ll refund you in full. Our ultimate mission is to make high quality, organic period care accessible + affordable for all, ESPECIALLY for students, POC, and low income folks. WHY CARE? Because we think everyone should have equal access to better period care. Let me know what you think! \*Feedback is encouraged and welcomed!\*

ok so...i got a lab position around the start of this semester at a lab i am super excited about, but the hiring process has been lengthy. therefore, i was told by my lab to enroll in a class for research credit the week of the add/drop deadline (i am a freshman so i am pretty unfamiliar with all these research processes). i went to four different advisors in different colleges (none of them could help me until the last one) to figure out which class in which college was best for me to enroll in. the final advisor was very helpful and gave me the correct form, and told me that even though the add/drop deadline was tomorrow, that she had access to enroll me through friday, and that if i emailed her on or before friday, she would get it done for me (i was so thankful for her!). i email the form to my lab immediately, they got the signatures really fast, and as SOON as i saw the signed form pop up in my mailbox friday morning, i forwarded it to my advisor. yes, i know that this was all extremely last minute, but this just happened to be when i got this lab position. i did all that i could to make it as fast as possible, and the lab was very timely as well. when i sent the form to the advisor via email, i got an automated response back that she was actually on vacation, which she did NOT tell me in our appointment a few days earlier. at the bottom of the email, she noted that she would be checking her email throughout the weekend for emails regarding enrollment issues and would try to fix them because she knew it was time-sensitive. i also went into the advising office that day with a hard copy of the course enrollment form. the doors were locked, but i somehow caught the eye of one woman walking by who told me the advisor was on vacation but that she could put the form in her mailbox, which i appreciated. i then emailed the advisor one more time saying that i also put the form in her mailbox. flash forward to TUESDAY, after no response all weekend, i get a response from the advisor saying that she missed my emails and was not able to enroll me. i immediately emailed my lab saying i am willing to do this without credit, that i really just want the experience, and that i hope this is still okay etc. etc. this morning, i receive an email back saying that they will not take me without being enrolled in credit as it is part of their rules, which i understand. i called the advisor and told her that i am NOT losing this position because she missed the deadline she told me she would make. i told her i NEED to talk to someone above her, or please please please help me out somehow because i did all that i could. she sounded extremely doubtful, and i still don't have an answer, but i am feeling pretty bummed out. this position meant so much to me (yes, i know i might sound stupid because i am a freshman and i have time etc. etc. ...but i really did not think i would get this position, and i have already trained for it and the project was something i am very passionate about). i really don't think it is fair that i might lose the position because the advisor was MIA. anyways, i'm not sure what my point was in posting this, and i am not trying to bash the advisors or berkeley, i just think this was really unprofessional and if there is nothing they can do (which is what it sounds like right now), then i guess i have to readjust my whole semester/summer plan. ugh. not the end of the world, but a really big disappointment. any advice welcome."

When I first got to Cal I was admitted into L&amp;S for MCB because my whole life I wanted to be a doctor. However, recently my goals have shifted and I realized that I want to help combat climate change in the future. I'm not interested in research so I want to be able to be on the tech front in addressing these issues. What I really want to major in now is engineering- mechanical, EECS, environmental, anything that will help me later down the road. However, I know that engineering here is basically impossible to get into once you're already in a different college so I was wondering if anyone could help me in deciding what to do. I've considered dropping out and reapplying for COE, transferring schools into a different engineering program, or majoring in L&amp;S CS despite that I won't be able to be as hands-on as I'd like regarding hardware and design. Any advice at all is really appreciated; I've seen the counselors here and they've basically told me it's not worth my time here to try to transfer into COE."

I was enrolled in Phys 7A this semester and I wasn't really vibing with it. The physics was interesting enough but the course overall just felt a bit dry, between the dreaded Mastering Physics and the frankly boring labs. I felt like I was only taking it to obtain the requisite knowledge to get into more interesting upper div physics courses. 

I had to withdraw this semester for unrelated reasons, so next semester I'm faced with the choice of re-enrolling in 7A or jumping into 5A. I've heard that 5A, while much harder, is a much more interesting course. I'm just hesitant to enroll in it because I'm an intended-CS major with only an interest in exploring physics, so I'm not sure I'd be able to balance it with my other courses (Next sem, I'd be hypothetically taking 5A along with Hug's 61B and maybe EE16A, and an easy breadth). However, it's a risk I'm willing to take if the course is far more interesting compared to 7A. So, for those who have taken 5A, would you say that the course itself was interesting, or did you feel like you were only taking it so you could take more interesting upper div physics classes?


Also, a followup question: Before my limited time in Physics 7A, I had no physics experience. I understand that people with strong HS physics backgrounds go into 5A and struggle. This puts me in a precarious position if I choose to enroll in 5A. What prep would you recommend I do to set myself up for success in 5A? I'm not enrolled this semester, so I do have a lot of time to do any necessary preparation.


Thanks for any advice."

The dialogue about the impeachment starts near the beginning. Having Biden in the White House is as good as Trump or anyone else in their organization. Obviously Schiff and Nadler pledged their allegiance to the organization by raping boys on the record, with their task being to drag out an impeachment designed to obstruct and delay any real efforts to remove the President, thus keeping Trump in power. The witness blocking was to cause an apparent uproar delaying things with legal actions until late Summer. Soon after, the President would resign, leaving any other candidate with not enough time or support to compete with an opportunistic Biden, who is as good as Trump or any other Illuminati friendly politician in the Presidency.

The app has a class groups feature, that allows students to easily join class group chats, and connect with their classmates. This is done by having users search their class name on the app, and adding themselves. This is an easy way to meet people in your class, and a great replacement to Canvas, as the professor is not constantly supervising the chat, and our app is much cleaner and easier to use. It is also available on desktop. We have lots of class groups being actively used right now, for the many different classes at Berkeley, with thousands of active users. We have class group chats for the many CS, Econ, Math, Bio, Psych,Engineering, and other subject classes. We have class group chats set up for most classes at Cal, and we want to grow! 

This app can be very beneficial during midterm season, to connect with hundreds of other students in your classes to assist and help your studies.

I’m only a freshman, but for some reason, I feel like the people I’ve met here are so temporary. I first meet people who I get along with super well and we really vibe with each other. Then after a while, I realize people here tend to either flake a lot or they just don’t prioritize hanging out with me (I’m always the one reaching out to them). I just don’t really get it because I get along with people really well but I just feel like a loser sometimes because I can’t get people to value me as a friend here the same way I would value them? And when I help people out with things I don’t feel like they would do the same back? 

I just feel like relationships are so shallow here for me personally which sucks because I see everyone becoming best friends with roommates and floormates or club members, but I either 1) don’t fit in their clique or 2) am never considered valued as equal of a friend as I value others. People always tell me that it’s only freshman year and there’s plenty of opportunities but I feel like I almost can’t even count on clubs or classes for close friends anymore. 

Maybe this is just a rant and only something I face, but would love to get any advice of how to go about this? I always just yearned for a close group of friends or just a few close friends but I feel like that’s so hard here. 

Also, if anyone knows how to balance everything socially and academically that would be great"

Anyone have experience with Craigslist around the Berkeley area? Is it reliable enough to use as an actual housing plan or should I just bite the cost for a double?

&amp;#x200B;

I recently received a 0 for a homework submission for eecs126 since it was ""too illegible."" However, I believe my work is perfectly legible. Of course I will admit my handwriting is pretty shitty, but certainly still decipherable. I grade for a different class and I have seen submissions way worse than mine. I find it very hard to believe that course staff is truly unable to read the work.

&amp;#x200B;

I have already discussed this with them in person, over email, and the TA's apparently talked with the professor (ramchandran) about this too. I suggested a resubmission but they turned it down because the solutions have been released now, and they made the claim that there's no way to tell whether or not I am just copying off the solutions at this point. I still think its wholly unfair to receive a 0 for work that I believe is legible. I believe the cutoff for legibility is so subjective and to receive a 0 for all the hours I put in is simply unjust. 

&amp;#x200B;

What is the next step that I should take? Should I contact the EECS department chairs? DSP? Some high up office?

I guess my main gripe with the concept of Regent's scholarship is that you're interviewing a bunch of 17 and 18-y/o kids whose primary driving force is probably their parents and not themselves. Also, separate point, the kids who need the scholarship money most to attend Berkeley usually aren't the 2-time US math olympiad gold medalists or the ones whose parents flew them out to Johns hopkins to take summer classes.

A few of my peers back in high school were pushed by their helicopter parents to do all these STEM competitions and Sat bootcamps and whatnot, and once they went to college, they either faded into mediocrity or failed classes and dropped out. There was a regents kid from my high school who turned out like this, which is why I started thinking about this.

I don't think success in high school is the best indicator of potential to succeed in college. Purely anecdotally (since I don't have the stats for this) it seems like the students who have regents are slightly more successful than the normal students. But at the same time I've seen some cs regents who just sit at home and play league, have a terrible GPA, no drive to find internships, and I've seen some normal cs students who are in the prestigious engineering clubs, with FANG swe internships straight out of freshman year. Again, everything's from my anecdotal experience here so don't let this be definitive.

I feel like it would be better to make Regents scholarship something you have to apply for after freshman year. That way, it would be merit-based like the current regents, except by the time you've finished a year in college the merit will be mostly yours and not a result of your parents pushing you. That way we won't have those situations when that one stupid kid in our group chat reveals that he's actually a regents scholar and no one wants to believe him.

you guys feel me on this one or nah"

I'm not here to fearmonger but it's just good to be aware that coronavirus is being transmitted among the community. Stay safe bears! 

Note from Nick Weaver: 

&gt;Note:  It is probably time to start considering the potential impact of COVID-19...Truth be told, the biggest threat is probably panic-related disruptions, not the virus itself, but I think it makes sense to start planning overall:  
&gt;  
&gt;Personal:  I think it might be a good idea to have about 30+ days of ""food""-like substance available, so 25 lbs of white rice and 25 lbs of beans: its cheap (\~$50 or so) and handy insurance, kept in a sealed bucket or similar.  Good for earthquake too..."

I am a Chinese college student who is learning CS61A right now all by myself.Maybe you could not even imagine how hard that is for me, when I feel puzzled there is even no one around me whom I could turn to, not to mention to have a TA, which I could only dream to have one. So sometimes I just so admire those students who can have all of those better resources and make it through more easily. 
But in spite of these difficulties, I still go on. And because I learn it by myself, I can control the speed of path. Sometimes I could slow down and take like one whole week to fully understand recursion, which really shits me out at the first beginning. But after going through so many  practices, now I could finish the extra hw03 about tower of Hanoi just in 30 minutes , without hints. So, as you can see, this isn't that bad. It's so wonderful if you could see yourself have built up base step by step and to see the things which are really hard for you at the beginning are no longer making you suffer.
PS: I like John very much, even though the only way I can see him is through YouTube videos. He can really make hardthings easy and explain the way you feel comfortable. I like him so much. 
PS: Today I spent whole night trying towork projects ""CATS"" on, I thought I could finish it only by one night, but the truth is I could only finish half of it and stuck at the adder,remove, substitute part. 
Learing CS61A is hard, doing it all alone is harder.  i  really wanna find a partner to help me especially when i suffer from some difficult problems. 
So,if you are interested, we can contact with each other and help each other.
This is my facebook account:
Then i can make a friend with a Berkeley student.(My dream school)
PS: You can also improve your Chinese language if you wish."

A wonderful age to live in, most grateful.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**: I used to work as a civil engineer before I recently quit. For a few months now I have been trying to get into Computer Science by choosing courses from [github/OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) and [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com). I took some programming courses as well as Nand2tetris I, so I have an idea about computer organisation. Now I am taking the spring 2015 version of 61C which explains and uses the MIPS architecture.

&amp;#x200B;

**Goal:** to generally understand what goes under the hood, don't really want to specialize in computer architecture field yet. I am also taking this course as a foundation for CS170 operating systems and CS186 database systems.

&amp;#x200B;

**Question:** The video lectures in sp15 are using MIPS ISA, do I lose a lot by going completely with it not caring about RISC-V? Or would it be worth the extra effort to check the recent lecture notes and scavenge information about RISC-V alongside the old video lectures and try to implement the projects in RISC-V? Thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

***Irrelevant rant:***  *I am 25, is it too late to spend time learning these fundamental courses? Some people say that I am no longer an 18 year-old freshman who has time to spend learning stuff before going into the working field and that I'd better spend my time learning technologies like web/mobile that would get me hired. I don't mind spending a year or two learning CS, but then I'd be a 27 year-old junior engineer? do FAANG-tier companies accept juniors that old? Thank you.*"
