6,Once again asking for your academic support (Grad school),1,2020-03-03 20:44:58,3,"Long story short, I was originally accepted to Stanford and another T5 school for EE undergrad. I loved Stanford way more--the people, the culture, the location (especially with my SAD), and overall atmosphere--but also didn't mind the other one either and thought it was okay too. I ultimately didn't choose Stanford because I was offered a full ride scholarship through a merit program given to about only 80 students here so that was a no brainer at the time; however, I can't say I'm enjoying my time here despite constant efforts to mingle and find community.

I'm interested in going here for grad school in EE/Bioeng but I always hear tales about how GPA is important for grad school and this semester particularly, I've been getting hit hard on midterms. Most people in my class are but it's not because the class as a whole doesn't understand the concepts--the professor even said he purposely makes it so that not everyone finishes on time and even curved our tests down because 50% of class made 90's one time. 

For any current grad students here, what's your story, what was your incoming gpa, and overall, what's important when applying for grad school? How can I set myself up to better prepare for grad school as a current sophomore? I guess that I'm just losing hope right now, probably having some imposter syndrome lately because I don't consider myself the brightest and I'm relatively slow at learning compared to my peers here despite receiving that merit scholarship. I also don't have any research experience other than being an research assistant in a bioeng lab making small things for grad students but not really contributing directly to their work. I suppose ideally just want someone to say, ""It's okay if your gpa drops. It's okay to not focus on school all the time and make time for your hobbies at the cost of your grades. There's still a chance."" Apologies if this type of post isn't allowed on this sub.",0.13694885361552028,0.5384149029982362,stanford

79,3 confirmed cases on campus &amp; employees still on-site,1,2020-03-12 19:09:30,13,"Hi everyone,

I'm asking again that students and the greater Stanford community support this petition for enforcing mandatory telecommuting practices for employees: http://chng.it/xjqQFK8Z


Stanford University has now confirmed 3 cases on campus, with additional cases being 'presumptive'. We are not asking for the closure of the University, as we expect to be just as productive at home. By enforcement of working remotely, this will help the greater campus and community, since it greatly reduced the amount of interaction between individuals who may be carriers/silent carriers, helping everyone involved. This will be supportive to the employees who will be required to remain on campus (custodial staff, etc) while greatly reducing their workload and reducing the amount of individuals they come in contact with. 


This will also be supportive to employees who have older children in school (who do not need constant supervision) that they would like to pull out for home instruction at this time. Many parents are worried about their young children who suffer from chronic illnesses, yet are unable to offer them an alternative due to being required to come in to work daily. 


No other *company* in the bay area is reacting like this with several confirmed cases on their campus. It is too late to be proactive, since it has likely already spread on the main campus, but it is time to be reactive and pause the spread. Stanford University should be especially concerned with this, since the Stanford hospital is in danger of becoming overwhelmed due to the overload of cases in a short period of time. 

Stanford has over 30,000 community members between the University, LPCH, and the main hospital. They interact daily and there are large portions of employees on the hospital side as well who can be staggered/completely work from home during this time while sufficiently supporting the medical staff. Please help and sign/pass on the petition.",0.17755952380952386,0.4995634920634921,stanford

If someone is good at the CMP regulation, please pm/email me at [biochemtutoring123@gmail.com](mailto:biochemtutoring123@gmail.com). I can pay you very well..  One example question we were given is about what will happen to the CMP in biosynthetic conditions? 

The answer we were given is here: We are in biosynthetic conditions. This means we are using something smaller (in this case citrate) and using that to build something larger (in this case fatty acids). For biosynthetic conditions to even be active it implies we have a much higher amount of ATP because ATP positively regulates biosynthetic pathways. Since we have high ATP that means have a lot of our products for the ETC and therefore ATP synthase will get inhibited. If we inhibit ATP synthase this means that we have nothing to dissipate our pH gradient and therefore it will become too unfavorable for the ETC to continue to pump protons against its concentration gradient and therefore the ETC also will shutdown. This will then cause a build-up of the substrates of the ETC, one of which is NADH. Now, that you have high amounts of NADH and ATP, they will together go and inhibit the irreversible steps of the TCA cycle.However, this is where it gets a bit complicated and why you need to remember the bigger picture (and this will answer your second question). Yes, NADH and ATP will both inhibit the irreversible steps of the TCA as well as ATP inhibiting both PFK and PK in glycolysis. However, remember that you are also removing citrate to produce fatty acids. Even though citrate synthase is being inhibited by NADH and ATP, if we keep removing citrate you would eventually get to a really really low concentration of citrate and therefore it will pull forward that reaction even though citrate synthase is also being inhibited (remember our bigger picture is that we need to keep being able to produce citrate to remove it to make fatty acids so that's what is happening here as well). Same thing happens for glycolysis. Since we keep removing acetyl-CoA to make citrate, and pyruvate to make acetyl-coA, and so on, the rest of glycolysis will also be pulled forward even though we are inhibiting many of its enzymes. So there wouldn't be an accumulation of glycolytic intermediates again because they are being broken down to form more citrate so we can ultimately make more fatty acids.",0.058643845866068085,0.47553123830901617,stanford

The class is point based but I’ve lost too many points in the class to make an A so I’m currently in the B range but we have a Lab Practicum coming up where I’m sure she’ll take off a lot of points (she’s known for taking off a lot of points for tiny errors), possibly making me end up in the C range. I’m certain I would make an A if I take the lab again in the spring of my senior year with a different professor.

Although Stanford has a relatively small team (\~50 people), we were able to finish top 10 in the last iteration of this game! Pretty great considering some of the larger college football fandoms have teams of 500+. We have a team discord (that has been fairly active over the last 2 years) that we use to discuss strategy and organize our actions. Please PM us ([u/bubthefish](https://www.reddit.com/u/bubthefish/), [u/Whatdatoast](https://www.reddit.com/u/Whatdatoast/), [u/Tinderformidgets](https://www.reddit.com/u/Tinderformidgets/)) if you want to join or have any questions! 

The rules for the game are described fully here: [https://collegefootballrisk.com/help](https://collegefootballrisk.com/help)

We initially start with the Stanford territory, and each day we can either attack a neighboring territory  or defend one of our own territories. Every person starts off as a 1-star unit, but can rank up throughout the game by completing various tasks. Every turn, for each territory, a unit is randomly selected (weighted by star count) and that person's school wins the territory! Your school is eliminated when they no longer hold any territories. Last school remaining wins!

Although the game sounds simple, it quickly evolved as teams formed alliances to defeat their rivals. If this sounds at all interesting to you, definitely sign up here: [https://collegefootballrisk.com/](https://collegefootballrisk.com/). If you're unsure of what to do for your first move, just attack Cal!

I’m a graduate student (non-STEM) interested in learning some more linear algebra applications (hopefully, eventually deep learning) Through undergrad/self-study, i’ve learned about pretty much everything on the Math51 syllabus until the last week or so, and I’m confident I could get up to speed with a few days of reviewing old notes. Also took CS106B last quarter with an A.

Has anyone taken CME103 and know if Math51 is critical for it? (it’s listed as a prereq, along with programming at the leve of cs106a). And if it isn’t, what would the process be for requesting permission to take it without the prereq this summer?

Of course you individually didn't get four job offers; that's the lump sum of what the five people you most recently spoke with got, but it's all sticking together in your mind. Of course you don't have three professors you text with; that's, like, the combined total of all of your friends plus those randos you sometimes talk to in your dorm (or on Zoom?). **You are only one Stanford student**, but it's easy to compare yourself with the combined top achievements of the 15 people you talk to regularly.

I was recently admitted to Stanford (a dream come true), and I was hoping to get some advice about choosing which school to attend next fall between Stanford, Harvard, and Yale. If anyone here chose Stanford over Harvard/Yale, I would really love to hear what made you choose Stanford.

I think I want to study either public policy, public health, or economics. I'd love to hear a student's perspective on studying something other than tech at Stanford.

Since these schools are relatively similar in academics, I was also hoping to hear about the social scenes. I think that greek life might be bigger at S than H/Y, which doesn't really bother me unless it comes off as overpowering campus social life. I also am a fan of school spirit-- so I think Stanford wins there!

Last, I'm from New York, so I wouldn't really get to visit home from Palo Alto except on long breaks. I don't think this is that much of a big deal for me personally, but my mom would rather I be closer to home.

So I am currently a student at Rutgers University (some of you prob have never even heard of us lol), and I was looking into (applying to?) transferring here to Stanford. While Rutgers is great in terms of opportunities and stuff, I feel somewhat limited by the academics, as there is something very specific I want to pursue academically, and that's not on option there. Actually, its not really an option in any universities besides a couple, including Stanford University. I do not want to transfer just because of the name, in fact, I ended up here specifically through searching that program I was looking into. 

I know the chances are absurdly low (Basically 1%), however I have taken advantage of many opportunities while here at Rutgers, and I even intend to start doing research next semester (I am currently a Freshman). As far as LORs I have been able to connect with multiple professors, who will probably write 2 of them, but then I also have a High School teacher who was also my Mock Trial coach, and who I still keep in contact with, who would be willing to write me one as well (for the extra LOR for someone who knows you well). 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I am rambling, but I just wanted to reach out here to see what I can do to be able to get in. Are there any transfers here who came from not a CC or the military, but from a State University? I feel like I've taken advantage of many things here, and this seems like an appropriate step to take. I have been lurking here for quite a while, and have been watching videos of students who come to this school, and I feel like I would fit in so well with the culture, which I have accidentally grown to love through my active indulging of any content Stanford-related.

Nobody in my school knows about ACT and SAT’s and nobody applied for an American institution. So I never really knew much about American institutions, but I’ve literally fallen in love with Stanford over the last couple months. 

I got into a top Canadian university, but it’s nothing like Stanford. It’s ranked in the 30-40 range worldwide, nowhere near Stanford. Also Stanford just seems so beautiful and close to where I dream of working one day, in the Silicon Valley. 

I want to transfer but I’m reading they only take 12-24 students, and favour veterans. I want to take a gap year, but then if I don’t get into Stanford it will be a big waste. 

Somebody’s advised me to just go to the Canadian university for first year, and apply as a freshman for Stanford. But then I won’t be able to get the credits from my first year at the Canadian university. I will have to pay tuition, but Canadian tuition is only 5-6k for Canadians so it’s not too bad, that’s fine I guess. 

My only concern is don’t I have to report I went to university for a year? The person I talked to said they can’t find out, but Stanford still wants to know probably.",0.13833333333333336,0.4312499999999999,stanford

More than that, I can't help but worry if the school that I'm going to will be the right fit for me. I would love any advice on where I should go, reasons why I should go to Stanford, and/or anything current students could tell me about everyday-life. 

Some more information about me:

 I'm on the fence between majoring in my two favorite subjects, political science and linguistics, and would love to go to a school that is strong in both. Any info. on these two departments would be very appreciated

I'm originally from San Francisco and have lived in California all my life. I've never really experienced snow or living out of state. I got into Georgetown early so I've really got myself into liking the idea of living in a big, urban environment on the East Coast and being kinda special for being from California (that last bit is silly, I know). On the other hand, going back to my ""home"", San Francisco, would be a dream for me—I really, really miss the city. I also have lots of family in the Bay Area who I would be very close to.

I also value pretty highly the availability of mental health resources, but I also realize that not many universities have necessarily good mental health services.

I come from a very tiny high school, \~70 people total, 19 in the senior class. I'm used to being able to talk to my teachers on a whim and having a very small social environment. Any info on what professor-student relationships at Stanford would be appreciated. I would also love information whatsoever on what social life is like at Stanford, how easy it is to make friends, how easy it is to become isolated if not active enough, how close people seem to be, how positive people seem to be, and how much toxic-competition there is.

Sorry, I know that's a lot, but I would be very grateful for any sort of help/advice/insight whatsoever. Thanks! :)",0.1700803363303363,0.46814060939060936,stanford

I don’t like the fact that everything is on a curve and it’s almost impossible to pull a +3.7 GPA because of it. Also whenever people talk about prestige, I always hear HYPSM and this makes me second guess wanting to go to Wharton as the UPenn brand is not as global.

291,Help an international student decide between Stanford and Wharton Undergraduate,1,2020-03-31 00:45:41,3,"Hey guys,

I'm an Indian student from the United Arab Emirates and I still can't believe I got into either of these schools, let alone both! Just for some context, I am *super* into tech entrepreneurship; most of my time in high school was consumed by my startups. Also, I plan on majoring in CS (I would do a dual degree in CS at Penn Engineering if I went to Wharton) and my dream is to graduate from college with a financially-sustainable startup that I can pursue as my full-time job. Besides entrepreneurship and STEM, I'm also interested in studying public policy and finance, but I probably won't pursue those fields professionally. 

With this in mind, I know Stanford seems like a no-brainer (and tbh I am heavily leaning towards Stanford), but I just want to make sure that I'm diligent about this selection process.

&amp;#x200B;

Just to play devil's advocate, I've listed a couple of Pros of going to Wharton, along with questions about Stanford that I was hoping you guys could answer:

1) Wharton is obviously a dedicated business school and there are tons of classes that sound interesting to me like Negotiations, VC fund management, business plan prep, fundraising, Startup accounting etc. Would I find easily classes like those at Stanford as well? If not, can I do those classes at the Stanford GSB as an undergrad?

2) I've heard that it's awesome to be an international student at Wharton because of the high % of international kids and the welcoming nature. How is it like to be an international kid at Stanford?

3) The Wharton Alumni community has a much stronger presence in my country than Stanford did. I've also heard that you will find more Wharton alums internationally and it's easier to raise money through them for ventures (especially in countries like India). Are Stanford alums generally US-centric? How strong are the alumni opportunities internationally?

4) Finally, I've heard that the social life at Penn is incredibly fun? How's the social life at Stanford, especially in the dorms?

My pre-medical fraternity, Sigma Mu Delta at Berkeley, has recently started a fundraiser called “Dare to Fight COVID”! The goal is to raise money for the Center of Disaster Philanthropy’s (CDF) COVID-19 relief fund. We’re inviting you and your organizations (Student Orgs, Frat/Sorority, Sports Team, etc.) to participate!

Essentially, your organization will come up with a list of dares that your members are willing to do. Then, your friends and family donate money to actually make you do them!

All the proceeds from this fundraiser are going to CDF, which then distributes the money to people fighting COVID-19 on the frontlines. You would donate to CDF directly, so that there is complete visibility over where your money goes!

Our fraternity raised more than $1000 in just over a day, so this fundraiser could potentially have a huge impact if more organizations get on board! There are about 6 organizations that have joined our movement so far, so you’d get to be an early member in what could become a national movement!

If your organization is interested in joining this movement, fill out this short google form: https://forms.gle/BzMb1RnNE4pu6XRu8

We will then send you a pdf that outlines next steps for getting your own fundraiser started!

344,Stanford or Johns Hopkins?,4,2020-04-03 18:26:29,16,"Hello! I have recently been accepted to both Stanford and Johns Hopkins, but I can't decide where to go because both schools provide so many amazing opportunities. I am planning to double major in Music Composition and English (or Creative Writing), so if anyone has any insight to offer regarding the music and creative writing programs at Stanford, please let me know!

I was accepted into the Double Degree Program between Johns Hopkins University and the Peabody Institute, so if I decide to attend, I would be majoring in composition at Peabody while majoring in Writing Seminars at Johns Hopkins. I know Johns Hopkins' Writing Seminars program is quite renowned, and Peabody is a well regarded music conservatory, so this option would be a great fit for me.

Because I can't find a lot of information about specific programs at Stanford, I don't know how good its music or creative writing programs are. Stanford does not offer Creative Writing as its own major, so I would be majoring in English with a Creative Writing emphasis as well as Music with a concentration in Composition. Regarding Stanford's music scene, are there a lot of musical opportunities or networking in the San Francisco Bay Area, and is Stanford's composition program well known at all?

Does anybody else find it weird the reaction you get when you are on internship and you mention you are from Stanford? I recently was doing an internship months back at a FAANG company, and I was talking with another intern. He was from a Canadian school from the west coast of Canada (decently well known) and he got so surprised and shocked when I told him I was from Stanford. 

Like he got so excited, and he starting saying how awesome it must be, he said it’s the best CS school and how it’s his dream school. I was kind of confused and told him how much I loved it. He then told another guy (also from the same university he was from) and he was surprised too.

However it always gets me thinking, yea Stanford is amazing, but don’t they realize we are literally at the same place doing an internship? Like Stanford ranks much higher than their school, but they are still doing internships at the same spot. I don’t know, I just find that’s weird. I’m not saying other schools are bad, but it feels as if you wouldn’t expect some of these schools to have students having internships. Especially because Stanford I know very well had the advantage in terms of jobs and what not, but it’s still weird seeing them react like that, considering we are at the same internship. 

Now I’m in no way shape or form saying internships at some of these companies should be for higher ranked schools, but I always find it weird. Especially when even other interns know Stanford is that respected.",0.04305555555555558,0.6061111111111112,stanford

377,Premed at Stanford Questions,3,2020-04-05 21:24:52,1,"Hi all!

I am a prospective premed freshman and I have begun to look through different requirements and get a vague idea of how I will plan my schedule. I was wondering if anyone who has gone through premed at Stanford could provide input!

1. In terms of getting the premed ""requirements"" done, how did you space out your classes? I was wondering if it was possible to finish all the necessary classes by the end of sophomore year, and take the MCAT by Junior year? How did you go through this?
2. If you took AP classes, did you claim the credit for any of them? Specifically, I have the opportunity to claim AP Chemistry, AP Physics, and AP Calculus. Do you think I should retake the classes to strengthen my background for both the MCAT and upper division classes? Or, should I avoid taking the classes (if, for example, they were known to be especially hard)?
3. I'm not sure if anyone had to go through this, but what would you say (in terms of difficulty) about ESF (Education as Self-Fashioning) course, which fulfills a Thinking Matters requirement as well as PWR 1 (first level of writing requirement). Would it be better to just take separate courses to satisfy these two requirements, keeping in mind I want to maintain a high GPA, and I would be taking it in conjunction with other potentially difficult and time consuming science classes?
4. I would love to major in another discipline that doesn't have a lot of overlap with premed prerequisites (not sure exactly what yet, but I am, for example, interested in Computer Science), but I'm not sure if this is possible with getting through all the premed requirements. Do you know of anyone who did this? 
5. What are some of the majors that have a lot of overlap with the premed prerequisites? Can anyone comment on the Biomedical Computation major (which has the overlap of computer science and bio that interests me) in general or as a premed student?
6. Finally, do you have any general or specific advice for me as an incoming freshman, or as an intended premed student? Especially about choosing classes where I will succeed (for example, classes with a higher distribution of As), and any resources to help me do so.

I know, I know I've heard it before. Stop worrying about GPA right now, you're not even in college yet. Many people come in intending to be premed or major in something, but either they find out they can't hack it or they decide to change. The truth is, I just want to be as prepared as possible coming in. Maybe my plans will change, but right now, I have a goal, and I will do everything I can to work towards it.

I know this post makes me sound narrow minded, but from what I've heard, getting into medical school is no joke. These questions are blunt because they are questions that I truly want to know and would not ask if my identity was known, or if I was in the process of applying.

I apologize in advance for all of these questions! I don't know anyone who has gone through premed at Stanford.

I'm a super SUPER light sleeper. Like, I will wake up if someone opens the front door or does the dishes during the night. To make it worse, I have something like a 10 to 6 sleep schedule, which I know is hard for many people to live around. 

However, I don't think I can afford to live in a studio or 1-bedroom. I got around this in undergrad by finding a super sweet roommate whose lifestyle matched my own, but I have no idea what the Stanford grad housing application looks like or if this is a guarantee.

397,Question from a Stanford Reject,1,2020-04-07 06:42:19,2,"Hey guys.

I thought I'd pop into this subreddit quickly to ask something that's been on my mind. I'm an international student (Arab male CS asking for almost full aid) who was deferred from REA back in December and then rejected a week ago.

I have been thinking I about trying an appeal, because I managed to figure out a way to pay a much bigger percentage of the cost of attendance (About 50k contribution compared to 14k lol). Now because Stanford is need-aware for internationals and explicitly says they have limited funds and accept few non-citizen fin aid applicants, the contribution (I'm assuming) is weighed heavily. 

Am I losing it or is this worth a shot?",0.11926406926406928,0.2902597402597402,stanford
398,Late Dropping Class after MS CS Acceptance,1,2020-04-07 08:18:33,1,"Hello!

I accepted my admissions offer from the MS in CS program next year at Stanford, and am considering late dropping an introductory machine learning class at my current undergraduate university. (I've been getting ~1 SD below the average on everything, don't need the class to graduate, and have little motivation to continue on given the whole pandemic thing going on right now.)

The university has extended the drop deadline to the beginning of finals week for everybody, but they have also instituted a blanket pass/no-pass policy for everyone as well. Especially since I'd have to retake this machine learning course over at Stanford anyways, and it's really hard to concentrate on studying since I'm trapped in a small apartment all day, I'm leaning towards just dropping the class outright.

Would the university consider rescinding my acceptance offer if they see that a class that had been listed on the previous official transcript I sent them is no longer there? I figured that if push comes to shove, I'd rather have a lack of a class on my transcript than have to explain to the grad student office than why there's a big fat ""No Pass"" on an introductory machine learning course. (Though, given the circumstances, they would probably understand if that were the case.) Also, should I still continue with the class even if the university won't consider rescinding my offer over a course drop?

Any advice is appreciated, and thank you so much!",-0.040674603174603176,0.3562698412698413,stanford

441,Stanford vs Harvard for CS/Physics Interests?,1,2020-04-10 20:22:27,20,"Hey everyone, hope you're all doing okay. I'm a cross-admit to Harvard and Stanford, and I'm finding it so hard to make a choice. I'd really like to study both physics and computer science in college, as my biggest interests atm are in the intersection of ML and physics in research. I also like the option of having CS industry work as a backup in case my interest in physics fades in the future.

So whichever school I go to, I'd likely want to do a double major (or maybe coterm in one of the two majors if I go with Stanford??). Both schools have top-notch physics programs (Harvard seems to be a tad bit better, especially with the amazing Center for Astrophysics, but prob nothing meaningfully different for undergrad). Obviously it's clear who has the better CS program.

Simply based on academics it seems like Stanford would be better since it accommodates both my interests very well, but I visited both campuses last summer, and there was something about Harvard's campus that felt cooler than Stanford's, and I really liked the urban setting in Cambridge. Their housing system seems awesome too. Maybe I'm just in over my head with the whole Harvard brand name. The social scene there seems a little wack, tho :/ I was hoping to use the admit weekends this month to validate my prior feelings, but that's not happening anymore :( 

I do like the idea of the quarter system since I'll be able to take so many more classes, and it seems that it would make things like a double major more feasible (I've tried to chart a 4 yr plan for physics and cs majors for both schools, quarter system would def space things out more, plus provide me with more electives).

I'm a recent 2024 admit torn between Stanford and Harvard for CS. Stanford sounds amazing for so many reasons, but I want to try to get a balanced picture and I have some specific concerns. 

\- Is it difficult to find your place and community at Stanford? The campus is so big that I could see it being isolating. What has been your experience? Are there enough opportunities to find close friends? In contrast, I really love Harvard's residential system which forms a more intimate community for 3 years.

\- CS students -- do you feel that the CS department is too big and not personalized? Is it difficult to get access to professors? Are internship and research opportunities crowded? I recognize that I would have to be proactive -- but if I devote the effort, will I generally get access to the resources?

\- Do you feel that you developed intellectually outside of your major? Harvard seems to emphasize breadth in overall intellectual development through gen-eds and diverse student interests. Do you feel like you got that at Stanford? How heavy is the CS presence and how varied are the student interests?

I would really love to hear your thoughts. Sorry for adding to the wave of admit questions. Not being able to visit is making this kind of difficult.

It's much harder without being able to visit Stanford,so I'll let you guys know where I'm at with my thinking and if any of you have thoughts to share I'd really appreciate it.

Thoughts on Stanford:

I am incredibly drawn to the idea of working on a start-up, whether it's making my own or joining another team. Preferably something to do with social impact. This is one of the biggest factors going for Stanford in my head since this is a big passion of mine, and one of the only things I really see myself doing for a career. My impression is that I'll be able to get somewhere with my entrepreneurial endeavours at Stanford more so than at Yale. 

Weather - I'm a California girl. Love being outdoors, the sunny weather is very appealing. 

Thoughts on Yale:

Yale's community with its residential colleges seems unparalleled in my head. The incredibly kind people and strong community are Yale's biggest selling point for me. I've never visited Stanford so I don't know what students are like...the vibe and the community is an unknown. 

I applied as an English major. Yale's humanities are known to be stronger. That leads me to another concern about Stanford, which is that less students seem to be in humanities fields. CS is where it's at right? 

So this is my dilemma. If any of you have things to share about Stanford's community in particular I'd appreciate it. How easy it is to find your people? Is there elitism/presence of cliques? Are people down to earth, genuine, chill?

Some info on me: I'm from the Bay Area. While currently undecided, I'm thinking about majoring in some mix of CS + Econ, although I have a wide set of interests so I would like to be able to explore many fields. I have visited both schools, but know comparatively less about Harvard since we visited while my older brother was applying to colleges so I was much younger. I would love to end up in NYC in the future, although of course that's subject to change!

**Harvard**

Pros

* urban environment, integrated within city
* Cambridge/Boston/East Coast would be a great new experience (snow!)
* insane alumni network, connections to NYC/Wall Street
* liberal arts education
* can also take classes at MIT

Cons

* not as strong at CS
* club comping seems somewhat intimidating and elitist
* not sure how true this is but Harvard has a reputation for being more uptight and snobbish
* I feel like I know less about Harvard, since all the in-person admitted events have been cancelled due to COVID-19, so I'm unsure of how I'll actually feel about the campus/vibe/etc.

**Stanford**

Pros

* again, I don't know how true this really is but Stanford students have a reputation for being happier
* supposedly a friendlier, kinder, more collaborative environment
* insanely good at CS
* can easily join any club, no club comping
* nice weather

Cons

* feels a little too close to/similar to home
* Stanford bubble, suburban environment
* pressure to do CS feels somewhat limiting
* connections to Silicon Valley mean I'd probably stay here for my entire life

651,HELP! Stanford or UCLA (Regents) '24,1,2020-05-01 18:56:05,5,"I’m a current high school senior and have been going back and forth between Stanford and UCLA, yet still can’t seem to decide! At Stanford I hope to pursue a HumBio major or an IDM, and possibly double minor in Dance and Education. At UCLA, I would double major in Dance and Physiological Science, and might double minor in Entrepreneurship and VAPA education. At UCLA I would also be a regents scholar, which means that UCLA is significantly cheaper than Stanford (UCLA estimated my EFC to be half of what Stanford said). My other main concerns include proximity to home (UCLA is closer) and uncertainty in funding due to corona (UCs no longer guarantee housing, and I wonder how else the pandemic will affect their educational resources). Additionally, I have several community college credits, which could transfer to UCLA, possibly shaving off a year or two and ultimately saving me both time and money? 

While I don’t know what career I want to pursue, whether it be in dance, research, or medicine (or some combination of all three), I do know that I don’t want to give up either one of my passions. Dance has been an integral part of my life, and I know UCLA would have a stronger/ higher level dance community. Stanford I feel has the best opportunities and educational programs for my pursuits, and I definitely feel that I would fit in with the student culture, however the lack of access to dance is a downside and the high cost of attendance worries me about loans and debt, especially since I want to go to grad school. UCLA on the other hand has a structured dance program and has a plethora of dance in the surrounding area, along with a lower cost of attendance (because of in-state tuition, merit scholarships, and commitment to meeting our EFC). There are also many research opportunities at UCLA and the school certainly would offer me a good education in the sciences, yet the size is considerably larger that Stanford, meaning that there would likely be less personalized interactions, harsher grading curves, and more of the classes would be taught by TAs. The other factor I have been considering is the funding of the schools in regards to COVID-19. Being an elite private institution, Stanford has a large endowment and certainly would remain well-off no matter when quarantine ends. UCLA is a public institution, and if quarantine lasts for quite some time, the school could lose a significant amount of funding since students would not be paying on-campus housing fees. Ultimately  could this lead to reduced research opportunities, financial aid, and overall access to undergraduate resources? Anyways, I was hoping anyone could give me any advice or insight and share their experiences? I’ll take information on anything; how hard the classes are for pre-health, what helped you decide, employment after graduation, etc.",0.11176719576719578,0.4255873015873017,stanford

In particular maybe one session has a better instructor than the other, or maybe the course content is too much to be squished into a shorter summer term?

Long story short I applied to Stanford this year RD, got rejected, and planning to re-apply next year REA.

I am not that sad about the result, because I was basically the first/only senior applying this year, but I still wish to have another shot for Stanford after my gap year.

heres what ive understood of it so far -

pros: (1) really academically intense people, the group self selects for a higher concentration of ambitious/studious ppl, usually super passionate about what they do (2) you can totally study in your room because quiet hours are respected and theres basically no partying (3) nice food and nice gym close by (4) ""tight knit community"" (not sure about this because it IS still 180 people?) (5) tutors (6) lots of funding and staffing

cons: (1) you wont live the cathincollege life, sort of? relatively more effortful to party/get drunk since you need to walk/bike to somewhere else and its also harder to be integrated into the all frosh culture/people (2) the environment can be a bit overbearing and stressful since even though the people are diverse, theyre all generally pretty hardworking and intense

my main concerns are that

(1) im not quite sure what kind of person chooses frosoco, because obv there are hardworking and academically intense people in every dorm and not just frosoco. is it only really quiet/shy people? im pretty talkative and excitable, i love to have spoNtanEOus aDVEntuRes, and uhhhh alcohol is 10/10 sometimes. will i have FUN at frosoco occasionally? i dont care about parties at all but i wanna be able to hang out w people and laugh a lot

(2) some ppl ive spoked to HATE it. this seems unreasonable to me, but its still concerning? ive heard that its a circle jerk of smart people who cant socialise at all. i dont necessarily mind that, but is this true?

honestly im pretty decided on frosoco, but i would just love to know more about it, so any anecdotes/experiences would be awesome.

How much of a “social life” would you be missing out going the ITALIC route? I know ITALIC is in an all frosh dorm but idk how much that overlaps.

What’s the kind of person that does ITALIC? Like the frosoco question person I’m a little more extroverted. 

An addition to that question is is ITALIC more visual or performing arts based? I’m a musician and while I’m interested in/don’t mind doing other art forms it would be really nice to mainly focus on music related humanities, regardless of the niche in music. What choices do you have in terms of the academic reqs?

Additionally, as a STEM (CS) major do you think joining ITALIC would be in any way detrimental to that? I would probably be around a significantly smaller population of STEM majors right?

The biggest pros for ITALIC for me is being around lots of arts oriented people and being able to take requirements with an arts theme.

I’ve heard mixed reviews — both really good and not so good — about ITALIC so I’m wondering what you guys think.",0.21024844720496894,0.40481366459627327,stanford

The 60CM series seems more cumulative. 

Moreover, I'm concerned about whether taking the discrete math series prevents me from exploring economics/engineering tracks. 

How would you recommend I make this decision, given that I'm not totally clear on what I want to major in? Do you think either decision is particularly costly/risky, or that I needn't worry about it too much? Are the two series generally considered similar in workload?

im mainly having intro series FOMO lol, like if if i do CM id be angsty about not getting to study graph theory and combinatorics etc, if i do DM id be angsty about missing out on real analysis. how to choose?

795,Taking a Gap Year during COVID19,4,2020-05-14 20:49:24,30,"Hello everyone!

I know there are other posts on the sub about taking a gap year, but I imagine this year is a little different with the whole COVID19 situation.

Basically, I have seen other people from the class of 2024 talking about taking a gap year, w/ upperclassmen egging them on (justification being, stanford tuition is too expensive to be getting taught by Zoom for one. Not an issue for me bc I'm on full finaid but still. +, ppl like stanford for the ppl and the ""stanford frosh experience"" is a super big part of building community early on, and those r things frosh won't get with online classes and remote learning) and that has made me think it might be a good decision.

But then I remember I'm poor, my apartment sucks (cockroaches everywhere. can't afford exterminator and dont know when we will be able to) and unemployment rates are rising (and I don't have any experience, I do not expect an 18 y/o with no experience to be getting jobs when 30% of the country is fixing to be unemployed. Not realistic) so finding a way to sustain myself is not something I should fall back on.. I also do not do well in online school, I have tried since 7th grade and it's really hard for me to stay on task w/ all the distractions of home. I did not get much out of the classes I took online this quarter except from the required assignments. Those are the only (very big) drawbacks

If I do take a gap year, I'd most likely (but not guaranteed to) have a regular frosh year experience with more opportunity to build community, and I'd get the most out of my academic experience. My friend in another state, either way I choose, has offered a room in her house for me to stay in, so I will at the very least be able to leave.

Basically, my question is, given that Fall Quarter will at least partially be online and (most likely) frosh are not going to be on campus, is it a good decision to just... make the decision to take a gap year and figure it out later? Do the positives of taking a gap year outweigh the negatives here? My biggest worry coming to Stanford is probably that I won't be able to find a community/friends at Stanford anyway (had a hard time in HS since i moved around a lot), so being online would just exacerbate that worry.

thanks for any help!

As I was filling out the Approaching Stanford forms, I had a couple of questions:

1. Would someone care to provide their perspective on ESF? I.e. are they worth it, what are they like, which ones are known to be good and why, etc. Not too interested at the moment (they seem way to liberal arts-like for me), but nothing's definite yet.
2. Any other Thinking Matters courses that are worth taking a look at? As of now, I'm probably going to take ""Our Genome"" or something because it matches my interests, but I'm also looking to explore. I'd love any recommendations!
3. How/when do we signup for introsems? I don't see the 2020-2021 introsems in the Approaching Stanford packet either, so where would we find them?
4. For anyone who studies BioE/has studied BioE, what's it like? I've heard BioE is super broad and isn't the best at helping you dive deep into one or a few areas, but I;m not sure, obviously, how true this is.
5. Thoughts on taking a heavy courseload first quarter? I.e. starting phys, chem, and math sequences right away and maybe even beginning to take BioE required courses
6. Anyone know how to get involved with the d-school as an undergrad and what clubs/organizations/classes to join to work on entrepreneurship?

I'm an incoming (prob online so idk) freshman and just wanted to ask you people about the whole textbook situation at Stanford.

And adding up all the money spent on textbooks that I'll buy throughout college is huge.

So I have some money saved for college and wanted to get over with this whole textbook thing as cheap as possible. Given that I'll always BUY second-hand textbooks, will it be cheaper to actually get an IPad Pro (smth life $1100) and get all books as ebooks?

855,Co-authorship Opportunity | Quantitative Social Science Paper | Python/Pandas,1,2020-05-21 11:04:41,0,"# What The Research Project is About

* This is a paper based on a natural experiment, in which a group of office workers were moved between locations and had randomly assigned seating.
* Meanwhile a control group in the same organization did not move or get re-arranged during the same period.
* The paper is about the idea that some people are just 'sharers' who tend to broadcast help and advice to anyone who will listen, while others are 'seekers' who are mainly interested in finding out stuff to get their work done. Most people are neither of these, of course.
* The research literature on knowledge-sharing at work seems to have ignored these kinds of personality-based differences, even though they're probably very important for designing effective organizations; ones where information flows throughout the organization.

# What would you get if you join the project?

* Co-authorship on the paper (2nd author). Huge boost for grad school applications and a nice resume item in general. The aim is eventually to publish it in a top-tier journal in Organization Theory.
* Direct research mentorship throughout the project, intensive help/advice on all aspects of your work.
* Potential for a recommendation letter for grad school/jobs.
* If relevant: help and advice for the grad school application process (cover letters, statement of purpose, GRE, etc).
* To express interest: fill in [this form](https://forms.gle/ejoBaQiBHQXRiEzu9) and I'll reach out for an initial chat about the project :)

# Who's Running the Project?

* I am a PhD candidate in Organizational Behavior at Stanford Graduate School of Business.
* Academic website here: cummins-orgs.github.io.
* Questions about me? Feel free to message on Reddit.

# Why advertise for this role?

* I'm stretched between 6 different projects right now.
* Currently this paper is number 6, so it is on the back-burner. All the data is collected and ready to go and I already got the first draft accepted into a conference. With your help it can be resurrected in time for the deadline (late June)!
* I'm experimenting with openly advertising this opportunity since I think anyone with the right data skills can do it.

* The contribution needed is suitable for an undergraduate with some data wrangling skills in Python/Pandas and an interest in network analysis. The whole project so far is inside of the Python ecosystem, R users need not apply ;P
* What you would do: finish and check over the data cleaning done so far; cut the data to test the main hypotheses; run network analyses and some simple statistical models; produce output suitable for inclusion in a (LaTeX) research paper. Scope to contribute to writing/theory as well, but that's not essential.
* This is not a paid role, so there's no expectation that it would be your main focus. However it does need to be mostly done by June 20th.",0.17563492063492062,0.5173992673992674,stanford

I didn't respond at the time because I didn't want to bother. However, the responses there convinced me to, because it showed similar problems to those of people on campus. You're blind to how you (or the people around you) actually treat conservatives.

I'm a 4th year senior 19 days from graduation. I'm not a Trumpist. The only position I really care about is free speech. People were claiming that's a left position, suit yourself. It certainly hasn't felt like it.

First, yes, campus is extremely Left-wing. From a campus survey this year, there are more Socialists than Republicans. This has consequences.

It has consequences on what we talk about. Whenever I tried to have honest conversations about, for example, illegal immigration, I'm shut down. So I stopped participating in those conversations.

It has consequences on schoolwork. One of my projects this year was deciding on a backend service. I suggested AWS. I was told we couldn't use AWS, because ICE uses it and they're evil and racist, ergo, if we use it too then we'll be evil. I beg your pardon? Regardless, we did not use AWS.

To the original Republican-already-turned-Libertarian (of course you meant Libertarian, silly Freshman, we don't take kindly to Republicans around here) poster: your political opinions might change and that's fine, but for now keep them on the down-low. For me, my one position of free speech has transformed into a Republican. And I'd never publicly come out and say it on campus. Best of luck.",0.04897486772486773,0.5646660052910053,stanford

Lmao.

&gt;STANFORD, CALIF. — Joining the ranks of tens of thousands of men before him, freshman Jamie Scott came to the startling realization during lunch yesterday that the women of Stanford are not good-looking.  
&gt;  
&gt;According to the Office of Admissions, which included the data in its yearly report entitled “Keeping Stanford Ugly,” when Scott logged onto Axess last night to file his official Acknowledgement that Stanford Women Are Unattractive, he became the last of the 782 current male freshmen to bag on Stanford chicks, marking the 17th straight year that the entire freshman class has openly stated its disdain for the women of the Farm.  
&gt;  
&gt;“It took a little longer this year to sew up that last spot, but Jamie finally came through for us and I’m proud,” said Dean of Admissions Robin Mamlet, in a statement released to the local press last night. “\[Former Dean of Admissions Robert\] Kinnally really set a fine standard for me to follow. I’m just trying to keep up the tradition. As we like to say around the office, ‘An ugly Stanford is a productive Stanford.’”  
&gt;  
&gt;Scott’s roommate, Tad Dorfman, was surprised that it took Scott so long to start ragging on Stanford women.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I don’t know what the hell that guy was thinking. I mean, look around you,” said Dorfman, as he loaded up his mammoth green monogrammed Land’s End backpack for a night of programming in Sweet Hall.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I’ve tried to send Jamie my whole collection of digital Anna Kournikova pictures so he can compare the girls here with a real woman, but he hasn’t been too interested. I mean, have you seen the one where she’s in that light blue Adidas outfit with those tiny shorts? Her legs go from her mouth to her . . .”  
&gt;  
&gt;But fortunately for Mamlet and the Admissions Office, Scott’s chemistry lab partner hooked up with her Florence Moore Hall advising associate after Saturday’s Exotic Erotic party, sending Scott into a tailspin that climaxed when he angrily lashed out at lunch.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Like when I came to school, I was bragging to all my friends going to MIT and Cornell that I was going to Cali, baby, the land of hot chicks,” Scott told his online chess buddies over a Wilbur dining meal of warm chicken quesadillas, polenta, carrot cake and a refreshing glass of blue Powerade.  
&gt;  
&gt;“But, man, I mean, I’d go so far as to possibly say that most of the time and on most occasions, with some exceptions of course, these girls are just not hot,” he concluded. “But, you know, that’s just me. I could be wrong. There are some cute girls. Like those Dollies. Whew. Now we’re talking.”  
&gt;  
&gt;While Scott’s confident, powerful declaration elicited praise from the administration, the girls of “Rinc” were not pleased.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lisa Walker, a freshman girl who was sitting by Scott when he made his statement, took quick offense to Scott’s opinions.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Are you kidding, Jamie!?!? You’re not such a stud yourself. I heard about when you got drunk at FuMuOnQua, tripped over that bike rack and broke your arm. And what about Brenda? Look at her, she’s cute. She’s got blond hair, just like your Anna Kournikova. And she’s an athlete, too. She plays rugby. That’s pretty hot,” Walker said as bits of tofu burger dribbled from her mouth.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dorfman, however, provided an eloquent defense of his friend’s courageous statement.  
&gt;  
&gt;“A few years back, a poll by some magazine said that Stanford guys are like No. 3 in their “hottest guys on campus” survey or something. Stanford girls ranked second to last. Deal with those hard facts,” said Dorfman, who sat down at lunch late after spending the morning alphabetizing his collection of MP3s.  
&gt;  
&gt;While reports are sketchy, numerous witnesses said they then heard Scott softly mutter, “Yeah, what up now, biznitch.” Scott refused comment.  
&gt;  
&gt;While Walker has launched a hate-crime investigation through the University, claiming that Scott violated her right to believe, despite all incontrovertible evidence, that she was mildly good-looking, Scott received a vote of support from a most likely sector.  
&gt;  
&gt;Though Scott never rushed and is already moving with his draw group into Kimball, last night the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity offered the freshman a “snap” bid, which allows the fraternity to say to a student, “Saaa-Nap! We want you in our house!”  
&gt;  
&gt;“We feel that Scott’s courageous statements today have proven that he has the personal integrity and brutal honesty necessary to be a part of our great brotherhood,” the SAE house said in a statement released late last night. “Though he may have been one of only eight guys not to say this to his roommate the first weekend of school, we still feel that his willingness to be hated by the majority of women on campus proves that Jamie Scott has what it takes to be in SAE. He is a True Gentleman.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Hours after the lunchtime conversation turned him into a campus hero, Scott said he just wanted all the attention to go away.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Look, I didn’t want any of this,” he said, after being found crumpled up in the corner of the Rinconada computer cluster, trying to find solace in the only place he’s ever really felt comfortable. “I just want to get back to my old life, when I could spend my Friday and Saturday nights watching South Park marathons with my friends.”  
&gt;  
&gt;An unlikely hero but, to the Admissions Office, a welcome voice nonetheless.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Jamie is a testament to the success of our admissions policies,” Mamlet concluded. “The more we can make the rest of campus look like Arroyo, the better.”",0.044646786107182146,0.5558129027188435,stanford

My car is registered out of state, but I am a stanford student, and the license plate has previously been on file with the university since I have a campus parking permit (though the license plate number might not be on file now, since Stanford has suspended all parking permit charges during covid..depends on how their database works).

What if I don't pay? I suppose there are a couple possibilities:

\- they report my license to the state of CA and my car risks being towed / impounded if I am ever pulled over or ticketed in the future

\- they tie the fee to my student bill and I end up paying anyway (but the Stanford University entity seems distinct from Santa clara police who issue this bill)

\- they find my license plate info in my home state database and mail the ticket to my real address

969,Question,5,2020-06-01 04:08:18,5,"I was just wondering...

Could I apply to my state school if I were to defer my enrollment as an incoming frosh? I'm not quite sure about the deferment policy with Stanford. Before you judge, I know I'm in an extremely privileged position as someone who is admitted and I'm extremely grateful. However, I'm probably in a really unique position right now.

To sum it up, when I originally applied, I was living in California. However, due to unexpected circumstances, my family has no other choice but to move to another state. I'm 100% committed to going to Stanford, but with all that has been going on, I've pretty much made my mind to defer my enrollment until next year.

I'm just extremely worried about the possibility of my family's financial circumstances doing a 180 between now and next year. And to cover my ends, I just wanted to apply to my state school IN MY NEW STATE (as a more affordable option) just in case something were to happen.

Has anyone been through similar circumstances where they had to apply to another school during their deferred year or know anyone who has?

Thank you and stay safe out there!",0.15313568010936432,0.577849927849928,stanford

979,"Dear Stanford: You’re probably going to be hybrid. But if you do go fully online, you’ll survive—because Stanford doesn’t have a soul. Here’s why that’s okay.",1,2020-06-01 23:27:04,1,"Notre Dame and Michigan State have decided on hybrid. The optics of Stanford offering Zoom classes, while “lesser” universities offer more or less the full college experience with modifications, aren’t great, especially from an alumni donations perspective.

Of course, to play devil’s advocate, you could argue that if there’s one university that loses relatively little remotely, it’s Stanford. Relatively.

What student dissatisfaction with Zoom University reveals is that universities are only secondarily in the credentialing-and-networking business, and primarily in the experience business.

But with Stanford, those two roles are flipped.

Having done my undergraduacy at Stanford and grad school at Berkeley, I can put it perspective that the point of Stanford isn’t really “the college experience.” Compared to Berkeley where even as a graduate student I have an amazing experience, whether seeing an interesting thing happening or overhearing an interesting conversation, at least every week. And even more-so when school is actually in session.

Plus the food’s a lot better too.

Aside from the classes, which I loved, the only time I can recall something Amazing happening at Stanford was during Bosp, or getting a chance to meet or shake hands with Very Important People. Stanford’s not so great at creating a culture. Of course, it’s very good at leveraging money into curating for you discrete experiences.

And that’s fine. It doesn’t have the intellectualism of the U of C or the historic sense of tradition of Princeton or the unique quirkiness of Berkeley or combine all three of those things like Harvard does. But that’s not why you go to Stanford.

It’s a wealthy suburban campus in a suburb that’s not defined by blue-blooded tradition, but pure economic productivity. A liberal arts university where virtually no-one actually majors in the liberal arts. Its party scene is lackluster. Where Palm Drive turns into University Avenue, you’d be forgiven for thinking that there isn’t really a university there at all.

Stanford boosterists would argue, it’s not as snobby as the Ivies. But in place of the snobbiness, there’s really nothing there.

Ever notice that what people tell you why they like Stanford, they never talk about the general zeitgeist or culture or “vibe.” They always talk about specific individual experiences that Stanford is able to leverage its vast resources into providing for you.

My point isn’t to complain. Far from it. It’s just to point out that a Stanford education, comparatively to other universities, is something that feasibly could survive a quarter or even a year in the cloud. At most universities, the experience is worth more than, or is equally as valuable as the credential and networking. At Stanford, the credential and networking are worth much more than the experience. And the credential and to a lesser extent the networking are much easier to cloudify.

Jeet Heer accuses Stanford of having lost its soul. My reply is, Stanford never had a soul.

And it’s been doing just fine without one. Because the purpose of Stanford, and Stanford specifically, isn’t to cultivate an organic culture or experience. It’s to produce members of the elite. And this is a valid and important societal function, and something that Stanford is very, very, very good at.",0.2441380070546737,0.49910493827160496,stanford

This would be my 2nd gap year as I'm currently on a gap 

PROS:

\-Full freshman experience next year

\-Don't lose summer if summer is an open quarter for frosh

\-No online classes, full club experience, don't lose a year at school

&amp;#x200B;

CONS:

\-Lose one year and set career back a year

\-I would be 20 entering college

\-School might return to normal in the spring making part of gap year pointless, and don't want to regret taking year later

&amp;#x200B;

Any input would be appreciated, especially from the point of someone who has experienced the freshman experience and can vouch if they would give up another year themselves in this position to have the experience, or if they don't feel it is worth THAT much, and would start school, even if the experience/overall atmosphere with clubs/professors is not the same.

Current aerospace engineering bachelors at an R1 university looking at potential master's programs. My goal is to work in the space industry -- preferably at SpaceX, JPL, Virgin, Blue Origin type companies, either in the space systems or, more likely, space GNC/astrodynamics fields. I'd love to attend Stanford's Masters in Aeronautics and Astronautics engineering program, but the cost is exorbitant (both for tuition/fees and cost of living in Silicon Valley) and they do not offer TA positions to MS students. I'm not stupid enough to take out student loans (fuck them since they drive up the cost for the rest of us) so I won't go anywhere that I won't get funding. Stanford is appealing because these companies heavily recruit from there, especially for students in the Spacecraft Guidance, Navigation, and Control specialty.

so, i just wanted to reach out to see if you guys can lend a second pair of eyes to read this gap year policy. i just wanted to make sure that I read it correctly. to my understanding, it seems to say that it's prohibited to ENROLL in a university, however, it doesn't address applying to one.

the policy:

*“I confirm that I plan to enroll at Stanford University in the fall of 2021. I acknowledge and agree that I may not apply to; hold a place at; enroll in any Stanford pre-collegiate programs; or enroll full-time in any other college or university while holding a deferred place at Stanford University.

Hello everyone, 

I never thought I would be making this post. I have already committed to UCLA and was super excited about attending. However, I got off the Stanford waitlist today and I’m so conflicted. Stanford was my dream school going in senior year and I was so devastated by my waitlist in March. However, I let it go and moved on. I am honestly so in shock about the acceptance and I don’t know what to do. 

UCLA pros: 

-Regents scholar which gives me a lot of money and other perks 

-Got housing

-Already got involved in some programs designed for minority, low income students at UCLA

-Found a good support system through upperclassmen/FGLI community here 

-I’m from the bay so SoCal would be a nice change 

-My heart wants me to come here but I feel like I might regret not choosing stanford 

Stanford pros: 

-My dream school since forever 

-Smaller campus and more resources due to their endowment 

-Grade inflation??? idk how true that is 

-Lots of opportunities available + funding for research, travel abroad, etc.

-Won’t be competing for resources (I’m premed so I’ve heard stories about how difficult it is to get into clubs and programs at UCLA) 

-Name brand

I never had to think about anything. I didnt have to worry about coverage when I travel back home to the east coast. It was great. They discontinued that plan starting this year. 

I switched to the blue shield trio plan because they made it seem like it was the replacement plan. It's not at all. The most important thing is that stanford is out of network for the blue shield plan. They dont have any doctors in palo alto the closest I could find are in sunnyvale and santa clara. Also labs can be a problem as well, you need to make sure whatever one you go to is in network. 

I made a dumb mistake of thinking I could keep my doctor at stanford when I switched to this plan because I asked them if they would accept blueshield trio. They said yes then tried to bill blue shield who sent me a letter saying they denied a claim for $700 because my doctor was out of network. 

It seems like my only option if I want to keep seeing my doctor at stanford is to use SHCA. I guess I will have to switch in October when open enrollment starts.

MIT was always my dream school (and, tbh, i didn't love Stanford when i visited), so i thought it would be an easy decision.

That being said, it sounds like MIT isn't likely to bring back frosh in the fall and i live in the bay area, so Stanford would be so much easier in terms of travel and covid. if i went to MIT, i'd probably gap because i don't really want to be across the country without contact with anyone else, and DEFINITELY not starting college online (though gapping is not ideal either). for this reason, my parents want me to go to Stanford, even though i didn't love it.

Thoughts? is it worth going to a school that i like less (at least in visits), in exchange for more certainty/planning around covid (at least this year)? Also, if anyone here is a Stanford student/pre-frosh who'd be willing to DM a bit more, that might be really helpful since I haven't actually met any current students beyond tour guides, so my impression might be limited. Thanks in advance :)

So I was recently admitted off the waitlist and need some help deciding between Stanford and the school I committed to, Northwestern. I know I would be happy at both but really need to familiarize myself more with Stanford and the community like I’ve gotten to know NU over the past couple months. 

It’s a hard decision - on the one hand, I know that if I was admitted to Stanford to begin with, I would’ve chosen it in a heartbeat. But now that I’ve taken the time to really fall in love with Northwestern, it’s hard to let go of that bond. 

A few things to consider: 

- I plan on living/working internationally and if I choose Stanford I’d probably be an IR major, as opposed to a polisci major at NU

- I’m also interested in the French department and planned on double majoring

- I don’t know if I prefer city life or suburbia tbh but Evanston is a suburb anyways (just with better access to the city imo)

- The weather’s not a huge deal since I’m pretty used to the cold but also mentally benefit from sunlight  

- I’m poor lol so there’s no cost difference but I’d like to know more about Stanford’s financial aid for low income kids

1217,"Another ""Off the Waitlist"" Post - Prospective Math Major with Concerns",6,2020-06-24 18:04:40,8,"Hey all, I'll try to briefly summarize my dilemma. After an agonizing college decision back in the spring, I committed to Carnegie Mellon for mathematics. Since then I've gotten to know my roommate quite well and I've been amping myself up for the mathematics program at CMU. It's focused, rigorous, and fast-paced. Also, CMU is working with me to transfer up to 60 of my existing ~110 credit hours of college credit (from dual-enrollment), which will likely end up satisfying most (if not all) of the general education requirements.

However, I was admitted to Stanford off the waitlist yesterday. I had Stanford as my top choice for the longest time, but I admittedly never looked at the fine details of every school. After some inspection, it seems that I can make the mathematics program just as rigorous and fast-paced at Stanford as at CMU. Also, Stanford appears to work with students like me who would come in with existing college credit through dual-enrollment. I would still be required to take a number of general education courses, though, no matter how many credits transferred in.

I haven't yet received a financial aid package, but I can say that the estimated package (based on the website calculator) spits a number out which matches the package offered by CMU. If Stanford comes back to surprise me, then I think the decision will be a lot easier one way or the other. For now, I am assuming that everything is equal. I understand that by posting here, I am guaranteed to get answers biased in favor of Stanford. I am simply posting for advice to get as clear of a picture as possible.

I am worried that if I switched to Stanford, I wouldn't be awarded nearly as much credit for my existing college coursework than if I stick with CMU. Also, I would hate to screw over my roommate---who matches my personality almost exactly---and all the counselors and staff I've already become acquainted with. Finally, I am not entirely sure which school has the better-fit culture for me. From my understanding, CMU has a focused, work-oriented culture while Stanford has a more lively and diverse atmosphere. The only thing which is a clear winner between the two is the weather and physical surroundings, since I do a lot of trail running.

I wouldn't mind hearing from math majors as to their experience with respect to coursework, summer internships, etc. Based on the syllabi I've read of courses at both schools, very similar material is covered with minor differences in focus and textbook (e.g., using Axler for linear algebra instead of Hoffman &amp; Kunze). I am particularly interested in the topics which marry mathematics and CS, such as cryptography, stochastic processes, and quantum information theory. I do not know whether I want to immediately pursue a Ph.D. after undergrad or go into industry, but ideally I want to be involved in some kind of research or development. As for summer internships, Stanford is annoyingly opaque regarding student outcomes, but I can only imagine that students do at least as well as students at CMU.",0.09937229437229439,0.535253968253968,stanford
1218,Stanford vs. Berkeley Undergrad--Bioengineering,2,2020-06-24 19:50:06,6," Hi! First off, if this isn't allowed, mods feel free to take it down!  


Anyways, I'm currently committed to UC Berkeley but I just got off the Stanford waitlist yesterday, so I'm really conflicted on which to choose. I'm planning on double-majoring in Bioengineering and Business at both schools, so in terms of major, they are both offering a potential ""in"". In terms of Bioengineering, I'm most interested in the research aspect, but I'm really not sure how easy it would be to get into labs at either. I also know that Berkeley's HAAS is pretty well-regarded, but I'm not sure what Stanford's business school is like, in terms of recognition/opportunities.  


In terms of location/the more minor things, I think I'll be happy at either, so I'm not too worried about that. From what I've heard, Stanford gives a lot more support, whereas Berkeley kind of lets each student fend for themselves, so if you have any experience with either (pros/cons) I would love to hear your insight! Also, I'm planning on either going into law school or getting a PhD in Bioengineering, but I might change plans, depending on how everything pans out. For the most part though, I'm planning on continuing my education past undergrad.  


Perhaps the most important factor is cost, because I'm expected to pay for most of my education. Berkeley would likely be the cheaper option, as I'll be able to get in-state after the first year. Also, I know that Berkeley has tuition remission for TAs and GSIs, which will definitely make it a lot cheaper (I would only paying for housing, books &amp; food). I'm not sure if Stanford has the same thing, or would be able to grant tuition remission under any other circumstances, but if it does, please let me know! However, I haven't received my Stanford financial aid package yet, but based on the rates I've been given by other private schools, I don't think it'll be as cheap as Berkeley. Also, do any of you know if they take into account whether or not I'll be paying for my own education? I know that that has blocked me from attending other private schools, so if any of you have experience with that, I would love your insight! Also, I have a couple scholarships that I have been applying to, which, for Berkeley, would greatly reduce my tuition, but for Stanford, would basically only cover my ""personal"" section of financials and part of the Stanford grant, so I wouldn't actually get as much help from those as I would like.   


If any of you would like to pm me, please feel free! Thank you all so much :)",0.21190277777777777,0.5721111111111111,stanford

1227,Waitlist Help! Help me decide between Stanford vs. Columbia for Physics/CS,1,2020-06-25 15:17:13,23,"Hello!

I was recently admitted off the waitlist and am now stuck choosing between Columbia and Stanford for Physics/CS. I've heard that Stanford's programs are the best of the best for both of my paths, but how much better would they be compared to Columbia's programs? How much would these programs differ between two already top-tier schools? And how hard would it be for me to double major in Physics and CS at Stanford if I was admitted for Physics?

I've listed some pros and cons for both schools below, as well as a comment on my financial situation. I would greatly appreciate any opinions to help me decide where I ultimately go!

&amp;#x200B;

Money:

My financial situation is about to change for both schools. My parents are currently going through a divorce after years of abuse from my dad, and my mom works as a middle-school teacher aid making 18k a year. I would most likely be re-filing under only her as my relationship with my dad isn't too great. This is bound to change the aid I receive from both schools, although I don't know if the change will be for the better or worse? Regardless i'll still list the current costs of both schools below, although i'm not too worried about the costs for either currently.

&amp;#x200B;

**Stanford Pros:**

* Ranked #1 for both programs i'm interested in (again i don't know how much the programs would differ  between two already great schools would be, but please enlighten me!)
* Cheaper at 19K (refer to the money comment above)
* Really friendly community from what I've heard
* SLAC for particle physics

**Stanford Cons:**

* Bubble campus, somewhat far from big cities, scared I might feel very disconnected

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Columbia Pros:**

* Right in NYC, **heavily** prefer an urban setting and getting to walk off campus quickly
* Admitted as a John Jay Scholar
* Core Curriculum
* Have a few friends going to the NYC area with me

**Columbia Cons:**

* More expensive at 23K (refer to the money comment above)
* Ranked lower for both my programs (still don't know how big of a difference there'd be between Columbia &amp; Stanford programs)

2. What is the current on-campus housing condition like compared to an outside apartment complex? Is there any major inconvenience that motivates students to look for off-campus housing?
3. Given 1) is not true, under what conditions will students consider an off-campus housing option? I know price is definitely the top one concern. What about others, like location, amenities, room types blah blah blah?

I'm definitely set on majoring in STEM and although it's not definitive it would probably be some sort of Engineering major (I'm really into Engineering Physics). Even though I'm really into STEM applications I do tend to enjoy the theoretical aspects of a lot of the same fields.

For context, I completed AP Calculus AB and BC with 5's, and last year I completed Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra and Applications, and Differential Equations for Engineering and Physics at a local community college. I'd like to say that my foundation in mathematic is strong. Once I get to campus, I'll be relieved of home responsibilities and other factors that made it difficult to concentrate on my schoolwork so I really hope and expect to thrive academically on campus (even if it's online for right now). 

As of right now, I'm looking into the Math 50, 60CM, and CME pathways; I'm just unsure which is the best for an FGLI student, freshman? Looking ahead, if I get accepted I would likely take an ESF Seminar and maybe a Nahuatl Special Language course for Fall Quarter. I'm also looking to complete the SSEA program to wet my feet a little.

**About Datathons:**

Datathons are competitions for data-driven, analytically minded students. They are analogous to “Hackathons” for software engineers, but instead of building apps, contestants use real-world data to develop substantiate solutions to a socially impactful problem.

2) gives sophomores the spring they missed out on
3) allows seniors and juniors summer for jobs/internships
4) allows for consecutive quarters on campus (except for the frosh...but unfortunately imo frosh should be last priority)",0.08756944444444444,0.5605555555555555,stanford

1324,Faking Accomplishments for the Knight Hennessy Scholarship (Stanford U's full scholarship),46,2020-07-05 20:17:58,29,"Greetings to the brilliant community at Stanford U. Hope you are all safe and doing fine.

My friends and I are new engineering graduates from a developing country of the world. In our university only a small community of students were passionately engaged in engineering, whereas the rest were there just to get an engineering degree. (I am not judging the rest. It is just how it is). We used to build solar cars and racing model planes etc and we were very well connected as a small community of engineering geeks.

During my third year our community heard that a boy in our University got in trouble for getting an article published in the city newspaper about an invention he faked. Let’s call this guy **“Frank”** (Inspired by the greatest conman Frank Abagnale). We engineering geeks had a good laugh about how Frank convinced the reporter that his invention could save the world by feeding her some gibberish technical words. In this part of the world such an act has no repercussions and he did not get affected by it. Lying, cheating, pirating, etc are common here but not taken seriously because we have bigger problems of our own.

About three months back we heard that Frank had received the 100% Knight Hennessey scholarship from Stanford U to pursue masters. We knew that Stanford U is the best University in the freaking world so this scholarship would be even more prestigious. But what we knew better was Frank must have done something shady again!

By just looking him up on the internet we got to know exactly what he had done to get this incredibly prestigious scholarship.

**FIRST THING: Started a Fake Non Profit organization with Fake product pictures and Fake testimonials.**

This was shocking to us. Frank had gone to poor settlements in rural areas and did legit photoshoots. He even made underprivileged people hold a bogus product (store bought) that he claimed to have built and pose for pictures! He had built a scam website for this which had no details whatsoever but just pictures, overambitious mission statements and lies about their achievements. He also got his family members to give testimonials about this organization. Recently he has taken down some photos with those bogus products and removed the testimonials by family members. But thankfully we have his entire old website saved. He has pulled this off to present himself as a humanitarian tech-guy to obtain the Scholarship.

We even think that he has taken the help of a local admission consultancy to pull off all this, because of their celebratory posts on social media. This consultancy is also involving other students in Frank’s organization who want to apply to universities in America and need some fake accomplishments.

**SECOND THING: Lied about getting a huge grant from one of the biggest foundations in the world.**

We know that this extremely huge and prestigious humanitarian grant was given to a senior professor in our University two years ago. We also know that the professor and his team have been working to implement their innovations locally for two years. Digging on this we found out that Frank was just unofficially involved with the team for a few days while drafting the grant proposal. In no way did he receive this grant nor did he work on anything related to it since the past two years. His name is not mentioned anywhere like the grant’s page on the foundation’s Website or our university website, because this is a complete lie.

There are a few more less serious fake accomplishments presented by Frank and we do have complete proof of it. But we will just stick to the above two for now.

Do keep in mind that Frank is an extremely charming guy, a great speaker who has been in the model united nations and other public speaking platforms. He has landed himself stellar research positions in the past even if it was because of his fraudulent marketing. Lastly he has good academic grades (not a big deal but still worth mentioning) and a number of research papers (poor quality but a large number of them). So we don’t think that he easily fooled Stanford U into giving him a scholarship. He WORKS HARD.

**One more shady thing:** He has not reported anyone about getting this scholarship, since there were no congratulatory posts ever by our university’s very active social media handles that congratulate people with the tiniest achievements. This achievement is massive and rare. We only got to know about this through our engineering geeks community in which someone got to know this from one of his close friends.

When we saw his recent fake accomplishments used to get the scholarship we approached a friendly professor from our university for guidance on what we should do. He said that we should not even think about it and just concentrate on our work and help better our society and god will take care of it somehow. He also suggested introspecting to see if we are angry out of jealousy. He read us some quotes from a religious philosophy book called the bhagwat geeta about focusing on our own business and how jealousy is bad for the mind. I believe in God and at that point I did think that I should let this go. I do not have the talent, accomplishments, nor the means to even get into Stanford U (let alone get a full scholarship), so why should I be bothered about Stanford U getting its next Elizabeth Holmes? And so I left it to God.

During these 3 months of quarantine I have had the chance of calmly talking about issues like frauds in technology and how local admission consultancies help students create fake versions of themselves etc. etc. with some interesting people including the leaders at the company where I work now who have studied and worked in America. Now upon introspecting these are the three key points I have that are meaningful to me as a believer in God who loves engineering and innovation and wants humanity to benefit from it.

**POINT ONE:** By giving Frank the quarter million dollar scholarship Stanford might have taken this money away from a brilliant but poor candidate from somewhere like Africa who could go on to do great things for humanity only if he had received the right opportunity. Spending resources on imposters affects the whole of human race. What if this huge amount of money was used to fund an organization that is developing the cure for AIDS?

**POINT TWO:** Most important point. Frank is negatively inspiring the upcoming engineers in my country. His success will surely encourage more youngsters to lead a fraudulent professional life and make them think that this is the best way to get success. Who doesn’t want success? I think that real meaningful success comes from truth and not lying and stepping on others. I love my country no matter how flawed it is and I see such wins by Frank as a threat to the much needed genuine intellectualism to benefit my society.

**POINT THREE:** What if this win encourages Frank to do more such things on a grander scale? What if he does become the next Elizabeth Holmes by starting a fraudulent company in my country and dupes people for billions of dollars? If he wrecks even one household in the future it would make me extremely sad for not speaking up when I saw this coming. God will not forgive me as well.

We know that these are some serious allegations against Frank. But we also want to know more about this scholarship program and get advices on what to do next so that we act with caution and not do something stupid. We are so happy to have found a reddit forum with the real Stanford U community.

**FIRST QUESTION:** is the Knight Hennessy Scholarship only given to potential leaders because it is a leadership program? Many great leaders lie without batting an eye. Does this mean that Knight Hennessey appreciates Frank’s leadership ability to lie and oversell himself? I am sure that they are not dumb and are quite diligent while selecting the scholars. How do they verify the details provided by a student? Is it based on trust? Will they reprimand a scholar for smartly faking accomplishments or is it a positive aspect for selection? (I am not asking this in a mocking way or trying to mock the genuine work of other amazing scholars at Stanford U. This is a genuine question. From obama to trump to hillary to bush, everyone's a great leader but boy they can lie)

**SECOND QUES:** what do you all think about this? Should we let this go and concentrate on our work and benefiting our society because that is more important? Is our outlook about this situation wrong and are we crossing the line by questioning the admission procedures in such a prestigious university? Please post your views down below because it will be extremely useful for us.

Thank you for reading till here. I congratulate you for all the achievements by Stanford U. I hope that god keeps blessing you all and you keep doing great things.

1326,Weighing out Pros and Cons for Next year,11,2020-07-05 21:29:02,11,"DISCLAIMER:
I am not telling anyone what to do but just wanted to give my thoughts as an incoming senior... I have a lot of time on my hands and since no one has posted some of the pros and cons of taking a LOA or gap year thought I would list this out for the poor sophomores who honestly have been absolutely fucked so far in their stanford experience 


Pros for staying on campus 
1) can continue finishing degree on time 
2) if major requires labs will have some in person classes
3) get to be on campus and away from home 
4) will possibly reconnect with friends 
5) able to work sooner

Cons...(an admittedly longer list imo)
1) no greek life or parties on campus 
2) rumored planning of tracking system (required to download app on phone so stanford knows of your whereabouts at all times) 
3) likely no sports 
4) masks will most likely need to be worn in dorms
5) no roommates, living in a single possibly two room double 
6) if or more so when you get COVID you will be mandated to quarantine in the row house in isolation 
7) no canpus events
8) lack of opportunity to interact with professors and gain connections 
9) lack of opportunity to interact with student body and gain connections as well
10) high likelihood of campus sending everyone back in middle of quarter if COVID outbreak increases 
11) no visitors (ie no parents or friends can really come to campus and visit you or at least not in the same way) 
12) inability to travel off campus (say goodbye to exploring)
13) likely gyms will close down if any COVID cases occur on campus 
14) ...take out dining hall food....
15) this is obvious but overall shittier education online...it’s just not the same
16) no sports likely!! No football tailgates pregames etc :(
17) U will be with only frosh and some of your class... no interaction with other grades :(((
18) job market is pretty rough anyways an extra year will give more time for economy to calm tf down 
19) this is fucking stanford. You get to do this once. Just think about if you really want this to be your experience. You can always work but you only do stanford once. 
 
Just listing some of the things I see. Will be different situation for everyone but if one was to ask my opinion I would highly suggest LOA for fall and see if campus is able to bring back all of undergrads in spring if a vaccine is possible...if not then take a gap year...

TLDR: suggest taking fall quarter off and then reevaluate after each quarter

Also want to acknowledge the fact that some are not privileged enough to be able to take a gap year or LOA. So if you are in a position to do so pls consider this when discussing with friends!!",0.03843000675447483,0.553660925363053,stanford

My question is: if I did actually get a 4 or a 5 on the test, but end up bombing the Stanford diagnostic exam, can Stanford force me to fulfill the language requirement through credits because the lousy placement performance takes precedence over the online AP?

This is important for me to know because if it can’t, then I’ll categorically take the placement test.

I recently finished a degree to work near Stanford. At the end of my schooling, I made a simple app that creates ""reddit-style"" message boards for all of the courses and departments at universities. You sign up, add your classes, and post images / text in your message boards. You can post with your profile and see your classmates, or post anonymously. You have a feed of posts from your classes. You get notifications when students post in your classes.

Does Stanford provide an internal tool similar to this? Would any of you find a tool like this useful? Is it customary that each course has a preset slack where students chat, or are there some courses where you don't have a way to post a message to your classmates? Please don't hesitate to respond if you wouldn't find this useful, I'd really like to learn about student opinions regarding class collaboration.

It feels like the university has specifically said a lot of detailed info regarding undergrads but none about grad students and have kind of delegated it to departments to either figure out or convey, but it seems like individual departments don't want to say anything/want that responsibility. While the plan for undergrads obviously has a lot of limitations and isn't perfect, it at least communicates that university is actively evaluating the many different aspects of it. I'm just nervous things are going to be a shitshow that could have been avoided that could impact plans and push things back. Like the fact that undergrads will have spread out move in dates but there hasn't been discussion about implementing the same system for grad students?

I also would hate if at the start of the semester, due to rising cases or deaths in the area, it's decided that we're no longer advised/allowed to move in. Obviously if that ends up being the case, reality can't be changed and it is what it is, but it's frustrating because it seems like all the info coming out of all different parts of Stanford for grad students is just so optimistically vague? Like there's been no indication that domestic grad students should be prepared to not come to campus. I don't think Stanford means to deliberately send this message, but if they do, I rather they come out and say it explicitly so I can take it at face value and stop worrying as much. Because it's worse to have this sense of false assurance that programs will mostly start in person if there is a non-negligible chance that grad students won't be allowed to move in to campus. Also for people moving across the country, I have no idea when to even book a plane ticket for...

1496,To gap or not to gap?,0,2020-07-23 08:29:36,22,"With \~the email\~ that was sent out earlier today, I am somewhat panicking about my (potential) freshman year being squandered by the pandemic. Obviously I'm super privileged to be in a position to be able to take a gap year (money isn't an issue), but I am still having a lot of anxiety about it. Redditors, help!

1. Friends: I was somewhat outgoing in hs, had relationships, etc., but never really had any super-duper close friendships or party experiences, both things I have been looking forward to at college. On one hand, if I take the risk to go to campus (sometime) this year (even if it's not in the fall), I will be surrounding myself with my people, something I have been waiting 18 years for. However, will the social scene be the same if it's severely limited? For some context, I'm planning on doing SLE, meaning that I will probably be mostly friends with people from my dorm. I also think that I thrive in smaller group environments which will be a pro of not taking a gap year. But will these social situations be able to exist in the first place???
2. The College Experience. If I gap, I will be more able to party, etc, but also just do things like go up to SF, go to movies with friends, etc.. However, my understanding is that I will have three years to do that. Is it worth it to waste a year of Stanford? Is it wasting a year of Stanford in the first place? I intend on mostly taking social science/humanities classes, at least my freshman year, so I don't think the learning will be severely stunted. If anyone disagrees/can tell me how their social science/humanities classes went over the spring quarter, that would be wonderful.
3. Plans if I gap. I have an internship (using this term lightly because I do not do much work at all) in a research interest I love and am passionate about. If I gap, I will continue this internship and beg my bosses for more work. However, I might miss taking classes, etc, and I can't expect that the internship will take up &gt;2hrs/week as it hasn't in the status quo. I am also thinking of doing language courses at my local uni with this time. 
4. Things at home are pretty good. I am close with my parents, and they're alright with the idea of me living with friends, etc, during a gap year or the online quarters. I have a Stanford friend I have ft-ed extensively and believe that I would really like living with, but I don't know them in real life so I cannot be sure. Ideal scenario at the moment is on campus fall and live with them (and some other people) somewhere in the winter/spring. Back in my hometown, as I said above, I don't have many friends, and I will likely become very lonely which affects my mental health a ton.
5. Risks: if they send out an email mid-August that says that Frosh are coming to campus in January, what if there is another spike in late December? Or, what if they send us home in the middle of fall quarter and I have half-baked friendships? Gah.

I'd like to think I have a strong foundation for Math 51, but it's Stanford so I really do not know what to expect. 

As for physics, my school only offered an introductory course which never appealed to me. Junior year I self-studied for AP Physics C: Mechanics and received a 5 but technically I have not taken any physics course. I do plan to somewhat review before I get to campus but honestly, I'm not sure if taking both at the same time is a good idea. I'm willing to put in the work because it looks like a class I would genuinely enjoy but am unsure if I'm setting myself up for failure or premature burnout. 

I plan to major in Engineering Physics as of right now (I understand that my interests may change). Also, something to note is that I have little exposure to Electricity and Magnetism but would probably do a small crash course before I enroll in Physics 63. What do you guys think? Is it a good class schedule that I should consider? Are these courses also doable with ESF? 

Thanks in advanced :)",0.16136904761904763,0.5066468253968253,stanford

1649,What is it like living near Stanford as an international graduate student on a stipend?,1,2020-08-06 01:07:30,5,"I'm at that stage where you sit down and decide where to go for grad school. But since the graduate-student strikes (Correct me if I'm wrong) that happened a while ago all over California, I'm reconsidering applying to any school in the state.

I'm immersed in research. I'm currently pursuing an [M.Sc](https://M.Sc). and I have been working at a research center for 5 years. This duo has given a front-row seat to watch my peers work hard as they pursue their Ph.D. and kept up with their job activities.

I know the Ph.D. journey is neither linear nor easy but when I read/research about the cost of living in California and how liveable it is for those who live on a graduate stipend, it seems that a Ph.D. in the state is a recipe for yet another substantial amount of stress.

It's not hard to come by people who in the (social) media narrate their Ph.D. paths as a part of the American Horror Story franchise. More than I care to admit, I've read people say they had to live with 4 or more people to afford the rent of a very small apartment. There are times they'll go as further as to say ""At some point, I had to choose between paying rent or buying food"".

Yet, Stanford isn't going anywhere and its research is at such top-level because - among many reasons - of how much it's invested in the school. Stanford is also a ""rich school"" - its endowment is large. 

So what's the real take here? I'm aiming for a Ph.D. in Engineering, so I don't know how different it is for people in Humanities departments, for instance. But how livable is the Stanford area if you live on a stipend? I'm sure it depends heavily on your lifestyle, but are the ""Pay Rent or Eat"" stories commonplace at the school? I feel like Southern California tends to be more expensive, but that doesn't mean that cost of living near Stanford is low by any means. 

Some people say these questions are better once you're admitted but given I'll probably need to send extra TOEFL and GRE scores that I have to pay for and the application itself is pricey and time-consuming, I'd rather have that information now. Also, in case it matters, I'm neither a US citizen nor a permanent resident of the US.

All information/insight is helpful. Thank you.",0.08261073942892125,0.45597522847522853,stanford

1654,Virtual Dorms at Stanford University,1,2020-08-06 16:15:52,8,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many Stanford frosh, myself included, have been forced to enroll remotely for the autumn quarter.  We face great uncertainty in our future, not knowing how we'll be able to experience college life as it was before the pandemic.  In a recent town hall meeting, university staff have acknowledged that learning at home just isn't the same as coming to campus.  Although this is an unfortunate fact of our current situation, that doesn't mean we should not strive to make the best of our first year.

The university has expressed plans to establish student groups for those enrolling remotely, but from what I've gathered, these seem to be oriented towards specific student interests.  Many of these club-like online groups already exist, but what they're missing is the sense of unity that only residential communities can bring.  COVID-19 has already begun to stratify our student body and isolate students from each other, and the last thing we need is to further exacerbate these problems.

My suggestion is for Stanford to assign ""housing"" to all undergraduate students, regardless of where they live.  These virtual dorms could house 8-10 students to ensure efficient communication and a high likelihood of finding new friends.  Roommates could plan group projects to build collaboration and encourage genuine interactions.  If something doesn't go as expected, a student could request to switch groups and be matched into a new dorm.  Even gap year students could join groups of their own to meet fellow classmates a year early.

I've attached a petition to Stanford University asking the school to support this initiative.  The university is in a unique position to make virtual dorms a reality.  With the information we submitted earlier in the year for roommate selection, including remote students in the assignment process should be a simple task.

But in order to convince university administrators that virtual dorms are worthwhile, I need your support.  By signing this petition, you assert the importance of providing a genuine college experience to all students at Stanford.

TL;DR: Without Stanford's assistance, us students who are staying at home face the possibility of spending a quarter or even a year cut off from the rest of our classmates, depriving us of an essential element of college life.  Please sign this petition to ask Stanford University to provide virtual dorm assignments for freshman students who have been forced to enroll remotely!

1736,Fall Quarter Undergrads Cancelled,1,2020-08-13 18:51:20,48,"From: Persis Drell [persis@stanford.edu](mailto:persis@stanford.edu) 

  Dear Faculty Colleagues,  You will shortly receive a message from the President announcing our decision not to bring frosh, sophomores and incoming transfer students to campus for a residential autumn quarter, as we had hoped.  As you know, we had been planning to have these undergraduate cohorts back this fall for an in-person residential experience. As you will see in the President’s letter, we have been closely monitoring the continued spread of COVID-19 and the reversal of the state’s reopening plans due to public health conditions. The recent state guidance for higher education to curtail the spread of COVID-19, which we fully support, prohibits most indoor classes while our county is still on the “watch list,” and it includes other restrictions on activities that would make for a very limiting on-campus undergraduate experience this fall.   Graduate students and professional school students will still be welcomed to campus, as will the approximately 800 undergraduates from all classes with special circumstances who have petitioned to come to campus and whose petitions have been granted. Further communications around planning for the year to come will follow over the next few days. We will continue to plan for bringing undergraduates back in winter, spring and summer quarters, assuming public health conditions allow, in a manner that supports our community’s safety and a robust undergraduate experience. I want to take this moment to thank all of you for the tremendous efforts you have been putting in to plan the next academic year, and a special thanks to those of you who had volunteered to teach in person for the fall. Today’s announcement will probably not be the last change of plans that we will have to make as we face this extraordinary year. While we strive to teach our students and engage with our research, we are having to reinvent much of what we do to meet the challenges presented by the circumstances of the pandemic.  I am deeply grateful for all of your unflagging efforts to support our mission in these unprecedented times.

I am curious to hear from graduate students currently living in on-campus housing how strictly the social distancing and shelter-in-place guidelines are enforced within residences.

The information [provided by the Dean of Students](https://deanofstudents.stanford.edu/sheltering-place-guidance-students-living-graduate-housing) includes a very strict no visitors policy as well as a short list of approved reasons to leave your residence. Although these guidelines are originally from Spring 2020, I would imagine similar rules to apply for the Fall quarter given the current situation. The language used there threatens ""immediate termination"" of your housing for violating the listed guidelines and encourages immediate reporting of violations via text or phone.

I want to be clear that I am not planning on going out frequently or holding parties in my apartment or anything of that nature. However, the strict guidelines listed here seem to imply that so much as leaving your apartment for the wrong reasons or bringing any other person near your apartment will result in being kicked out of housing and forced to pay for the remainder of the quarter.

Based on the experiences of graduate students in spring 2020, are these guidelines actively enforced by housing staff or other students? or is enforcement more passive or based on an honors-type system with people only reporting when they notice an issue in their own space?

Also, if you do happen to be caught violating their policies, how likely are they to follow through with the threat of ""immediate termination"" versus opting for a less severe punishment?",0.03446969696969696,0.49621212121212127,stanford

1776,Graduate Students in Stanford Housing Asked to Sign Campus Compact,1,2020-08-15 16:48:39,16," Dear graduate students:  


We are writing with information regarding one important way we are asking you to participate in making campus as safe as possible during the upcoming academic year.  We have an individual and collective responsibility to protect ourselves and all members of the Stanford community -- including custodial, dining, instructional, and residential employees whose work requires them to be on campus. It is critical that we all commit to preventative measures such as face coverings, COVID testing, and physical distancing. We are calling this commitment a “Campus Compact”, which we will ask all graduate students who are living in on or off-campus Stanford housing or coming to campus this autumn to sign via Axess. We are also asking postdoctoral scholars who are living in Stanford housing to sign the Campus Compact. The expectations articulated in the compact align with the current county and state health orders, including the recently issued guidance for institutions of higher education, and represent critical, evidence-based practices for preventing spread of the virus.    


The compact is the product of the work of dozens of Stanford students, faculty, and administrators. The university’s COVID Policy Group tasked a committee of representatives from the Graduate Life Office, Dean of Students, Residential Education, Black Community Services Center, Office of Alcohol Policy &amp; Education, Office of the General Counsel, Bechtel International Center, and the Department of Athletics, Physical Education and Recreation to create the compact. The committee gathered insights through a series of dialogues with critical stakeholders and received input and guidance from Vaden Health Services and deans and associate deans from all of the graduate schools.    


The compact, available shortly when you log into Axess, includes expectations relating to testing, isolation and quarantine; hygiene and distancing; and guests, access and travel.  It is our sincere hope that all will follow the compact consistently out of care and compassion for fellow community members. However, in case an individual chooses to violate the compact’s expectations and put others at risk, we have also included an accountability process.      


We realize that the timing of the release of this document is less than ideal, with many graduate students already on campus and many more enrolling in courses very shortly.  This was not the university’s goal, but we placed a high priority on ensuring broad input from the community so that the compact was reflective of our collective values and public health mandates. In addition, we felt it was critical to wait for the governor’s higher education guidance to ensure we were providing the fullest picture possible of the expectations.      


We thank you in advance for all your contributions to preventing the spread of COVID so that we may continue to pursue the learning and discovery at the heart of our university.

1777,Thoughts on gap year,1,2020-08-15 17:26:31,19,"I know that a lot of incoming freshmen are struggling with the decision to take a gap year, and it seems like a lot of people are starting to get really upset over the decision. I just wanted to share my thoughts on this given that I graduated undergrad recently:

If I were in your shoes, I would do the online virtual freshmen year. I know a lot of people are concerned about making friends and going to parties, but all of this stuff will be possible during your sophomore year. Quite frankly, I made the overwhelming majority of my friends after freshmen year and had the most fun at parties and stuff during junior year. During your freshmen year, you are put into a dorm with random people who you may or may not click with... the friends you make are generally a product of circumstance rather than compatibility.

Also, I generally didn't like freshmen year because freshmen are at the bottom of the Totem pole for everything. It was super frustrating to have to do all of the grunt work in intro classes and for the WAYS/THINK/PWR requirements and not get to take the interesting classes I wanted to take. I also had a hard time getting an internship and couldn't get involved in research because no one wants to work with freshmen. Once sophomore year started, all of the walls came down and it was so easy to get involved with opportunities.

My point is that there is plenty that isn't glamorous about freshmen year and I think it's a fine choice to do it online. Stanford is an amazing place, but I personally thought it was much more amazing after freshmen year because only then are most opportunities available to you.",0.18944444444444442,0.5432222222222223,stanford

However, my first year was somewhat of a disaster bc my planning was off. Long story short, I intend to major in bio because I am predental and that I enjoy learning about bio stuff. I didn't come into Stanford with much chemistry courses knowledge so I decided to start taking chem classes in my sophomore year, so I can study chemistry by myself to be more prepared during my freshman summer break. It turned out the biology core courses require a decent portion of chem knowledge (like a decent amount of chem knowledge at Stanford because some students are commenting (On carta) that even though the bio core courses say it has no prerequisites, it still requires a decent amount of chem knowledge (like up to chem 121 or something like that), some examples include bio 83 (biochemistry) and bio 82 (genetics). I plan to take my chem courses this sophomore year. However, I am a bit afraid to take the bio core courses at the same time as my chem classes (which are chem 31 and 33) since I got burned by one of the bio core courses in my freshman year. I wonder if is feasible to still graduate on time if I start taking my bio core courses at my junior year, which would allow me to be more prepared for the bio core courses (and get better grades) since I would have some chemistry knowledge after taking chem 31 and 33 sophomore year. I am somewhat considering majoring in psychology or human biology because the bio core courses are still somewhat disorganized after bio department made changes to it a few years ago. In addition, I probably don't have enough chem knowledge to do well at bio core courses in my sophomore year. I am stressed because I don't know how to plan my courses....

1857,"If you haven't already, you should really read Chanel Miller's ""Know My Name""",1,2020-08-19 18:59:53,5,"I was disappointed to learn that ""Know My Name"" wasn't  part of the 2020 Three Books for freshmen. But even if you're not an incoming freshman, I believe it's important to learn about survivor stories like Chanel's. Her story gives important insight into Stanford's response, or lack thereof, to sexual assault on campus. And it's important to know about the long term effects of sexual assault, especially since party culture is synonymous with college culture. Knowing about survivor stories is a small step in destigmatizing talk about sexaul assault.

I hadn't heard much about the case before coming to Stanford and it wasn't until my PWR class that I learned more about what happened to Chanel and about Stanford's hesitancy to respond. I only recently built up the courage to read ""Know My Name"", since I knew the book covers heavy topics like rape, sexual assault, and mental illness.  The book is a very engaging piece of literature, but I would recommend spreading out your reading sessions because reading the book all at once can be emotionally taxing.

""Know My Name"" is available for free online via [Stanford Libraries](https://library.stanford.edu/), and it only takes about a dozen hours to read. If you don't end up reading the book, I would at least recommend that you to read Chanel's [Victim Impact Statement](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katiejmbaker/heres-the-powerful-letter-the-stanford-victim-read-to-her-ra). Her Victim Impact Statement is really powerful and you can also watch Chanel read her statement on [60 Minutes](https://youtu.be/qK28Powy4ZQ). Before you read the book/statement, I would recommend watching the [book promo](https://youtu.be/ouIxvBMF7Rw) that she animated. It conveys the themes of the books in a few minutes and it can help you get a feeling of the heavy topics that are discussed.

Stanford still offers resources and support for survivors. You can find more information [here](https://sexualviolencesupport.stanford.edu/). 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: it's a damn good book and it'll inform you about the reality of sexual assault and the aftermath of it. The book discusses heavy topics so be ready for that.",0.13999999999999999,0.5907070707070708,stanford

1865,Uncertainty about Math 51,1,2020-08-20 01:26:33,3,"Hello everyone! I’m an incoming frosh seeking some advice about taking Math 51 this fall. A quick glance through this sub has confirmed that the class (particularly in the fall) has a pretty bad reputation, but I still wanted to gather some opinions because my situation is a little unusual.

At the beginning of quarantine, I was bored and wanted something productive to do, so I self-studied AP Calculus BC on Khan Academy. When I took the math placement test earlier this month, I received 100% and was recommended for Math 51. At first, I was going to take the opportunity, but now I have some reservations and am considering starting with Math 21 in the fall and Math 51 later.

1) Khan Academy is great and all, but I’ve never had a formal (classroom) background in Calc BC. From what I’ve heard, Calc BC is not necessary for Math 51, so I suppose my question here is: is there any reason to take math 21 if I am (for now) pre-med and planning on majoring in Human Bio? Are the concepts applicable later on?

2) As I mentioned, I’m a prospective pre-med, and after speaking with my NSO student advisor, she told me that there is no reason to take Math 21 because I could just take Math 51 to fulfill the pre-med math requirement. This puts me in another difficult situation. I feel like Math 21 is the “safer” option, but the most efficient path would be just getting Math 51 over with.

3) I’m aware that many students who start with Math 51 in the fall have prior exposure to linear algebra and multivariable calc. As you have probably guessed, I do not. Stories about impossible fall curves are also weighing heavily on my mind right now.

4) The online format. I read student reviews on Carta, and almost all the reviews for Math 51 were negative, particularly for the last (online) quarter. Some mentioned that the class would be much better in person. I know that Carta may have some voluntary response bias going on, but these reviews, coupled with what I’ve heard about the fall curve, make me want to hold off on Math 51 for now. However, considering I don’t know when in-person classes will resume, it might be pointless to wait around for Math 51 since I might have to take it online anyways.

For reference, I’d be taking Math 51 concurrently with Chem 31M and (hopefully) PWR. 

TLDR; should I take a risk and save time with Math 51,  or play it safe with Math 21?

* CS 224S/U - These courses seem really interesting and are in areas I want to get into (speech recognition and NLU), im just not sure how relevant either course is and I know 224S is very inconsistently offered.
* CS 228 - I heard nothing but good things from all my friends who took this course, it seems interesting but really fucking hard.
* CS 234 - I liked RL when I learned it in 221/229 but know that both courses barely cover it, would be cool to see it in depth, but also i'm not sure how useful it is since im trying to do data science which never touches RL.
* CS 246 - I actually took this course for a bit, it seemed interesting but it feels like really mundane programming for the most part, it does seem like the most ""useful"" course I could take, and I would also like to learn a bit more about tree-based methods.

Im lightly considering other AI courses (224W, 236, etc.) but these above options are the main ones i'm considering.

1) You must major in computer science in the artificial intelligence concentration. Alternative, consider pure mathematics. Any other major is extremely sellout or intellectual unrewarding--you will be mocked. Please, please, do not go in to finance.

2) The standard fall schedule for an ""acceptable student"" (top 1%) looks like this. I highly recommend you sign up for these courses:

* MATH 61CM
* PHYSICS 61
* CS 106X
* ESF1/PWR/THINK

If you don't think you can handle this, you are a wimp. 

3) If you didn't sign up for FroSoCo, you made a mistake. Email your RF immediately.

4) Please begin to find your co-founders immediately for your freshman year startup. If you are not in the 'freshaman startup squad', you will not be respected.

5) You must get a research position at a Stanford AI lab as a freshman to get a decent letter of recommendation for the co-term or other graduate studies. Ideally, work with Fei-Fei Li and publish at CVPR or NeurIPS multiple times within your freshman year (first-author or you are a loser).

5) Speaking of the co-term, prepare your schedule so that you finish your BS+MS in CS in 3 years

6) The only acceptable jobs after graduation are:

* SWE/Research Scientist at FAANG or a unicorn startup
* CEO/CTO/CMO/COO at your own startup

My parents dont earn alot so I basically got a full tuition this year which is why I decided to not take a gap mostly, but next year, more income will come in and Ill have to start paying some tuition (although not too much!). So i guess I just decided at the end not to gap. HOWEVER, as a slight introvert, I make friends better in person and am a bit awk during zoom calls so the thing I’m scared the most is : How will I make friends during freshman year, where apparently everyone finds their soulmates/group? Relying online for finding genuine friendship scares me so much it makes me anxious thinking about it cause i tend to be a bit awk. 

I reorganized my thoughts and came to this conclusion: I want a normal freshman experience without online for the connections, experience, and friendships. However, I do want to get my career rolling asap to support my family in their incomes and honestly, start my own, independent life. Also, my tuition is free this year. But I get anxious and frustrated that I havent made close friends yet and I wont be able to for the rest of my stanford life and that I maybe shoulda take a gap. 

Life is all about choices but I keep doubting mine :/ should I email stanford asap to take a gap?",0.15811287477954145,0.5568783068783069,stanford

1968,My Advice on Picking Math Classes (for Freshman),1,2020-08-23 18:47:38,17,"Over the last day, I've seen a lot of questions regarding math classes. Hopefully, this helps. I will probably make another post like this regarding CS classes and possibly general advice. I will cover the common decision between Math19/20/21/51 and/or the CME track. If any other students have advice, let me know, and I'll update this accordingly.

**MATH or CME?**

My impression is that the difficulty is about the same. Math51 used to be notoriously challenging, so CME was known as being easier. However, the Math51 curriculum was drastically changed last year, and now it's balanced. CME introduces you to MatLab, which is a really good skill if you're applying to engineering jobs in the future. If you're an engineering major, you'll eventually use MatLab in other classes anyway, so I wouldn't put too much value on that. The math route is, well, more ""mathy."" It will feel like a more traditional math class. Both will prepare you equally for your majors, that's why they're listed as interchangeable.

**Take 19/20/21 (calc first) or 51 (lin. alg. first)?!?**

This is not a question of which is ""harder."" They are entirely different. Math51 barely goes into multivariable, so the math skills required are mostly just basic algebra. However, Math51 is conceptually very difficult, which is why the class can be hard. On the other hand, the calc classes are traditional calc classes. Along with any conceptual difficulty encompassed in calculus, there is the difficulty of learning a ""higher math language"" that is harder algebra. But just because you are a god at calculus, that does NOT mean math51 will be easy for you. And just because calculus is hard for you, that does NOT mean math51 will be hard too. They are very different.

My advice: first, take the placement exam to see what that says. If you already did AB/BC in high school, I'd probably go with 51. 

**OMG I'M FREAKING OUT WILL I BE BEHIND IN MY MAJOR IF I MAKE THE WRONG CHOICE?!?!?!?!?!?!**

No.

If you're really struggling to decide. Flip a coin. Otherwise, just shop multiple math classes to see which is best for you.

Online school sucks. You will probably be online for the whole year. Don't let this stupid virus take away your college experience.

To paraphrase The Office: YOU ARE ENTERING ""THE GOOD OL' DAYS""

I know you won't be able to do everything you've wanted to do in college, but you should make the best of it. You should reach out to kids in your Zoom classes, you should try to organize study groups with people, you should reach out and ask if your classmates want to have small group or 1 on 1 Zoom calls for fun, you should join clubs, you should research what you want to do the moment campus opens up again.

Other people are probably going to be hesitant to be outgoing. It's your responsibility to take the lead and initiate.

Your Stanford experience will be remembered as 10% academics and 90% social life and experiences. Don't lose a year of those experiences just because it's a little bit harder to reach out to people.

Make the best of it. In times like these, a good social experience won't be handed to you. You will have to work for it, but you all can do it!

1971,My Advice on Picking CS Classes (for Freshmen),1,2020-08-23 21:44:49,20,"I recently made [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/if8qf2/my_advice_on_picking_math_classes_for_freshman/) regarding my thoughts on math classes. Here are my thoughts on CS classes. These are hopefully as useful as they are fun to make.

**Brief Background:** I'm a sophomore. I took AP CS in high school, took 106B in fall, 103 + 107 in winter, and 448P + 109 in spring. I have friends who took many other CS classes whose advice I'll include.

**Entering as a Freshman:** If you have done AP CS, code on your own, or you've done a few CS classes in high school, start with CS106B. Otherwise, do CS106A.  I've heard about CS105, but I personally think it's a waste of time and you should just start at 106A if you're a beginner.

**CS106B vs CS106X:** CS106X covers the EXACT same things as 106B, there is just more work and the tests are probably harder. I really don't see the point in taking it. The best coders I know did 106B.

**CS107 - The CS Major ""Weed-Out"" Class:** Pretty soon, you'll start to hear some legends about the valiant students who stayed up for 3 days straight on Binary Bomb or kids who worked on Heap Allocator for 90 hours or that time when Jerry Cain tied up students in his underground dungeon and made them write functions with pointers to pointers to pointers of pointers that return void\*. Ok. These are bullshit. This just wasn't the case. CS107 was undeniably a challenging class that had 5-15 hours of work a week, but these horror stories are just false unless you don't manage your time and you don't pay attention in class. Most of my friends and I thought Binary Bomb was among the more straightforward assignments. Heap Allocator was definitely hard, but nothing insane if you manage your time properly. Don't let the 107 mythology scare you away. Hundreds of kids do it every quarter, and you can too!

**CS107 vs CS107E:** Both will cover the same topics (that's why they are interchangeable), but CS107E is known to take up way more time. 107E involves hands-on EE stuff, so if that's what you're really into, then go for it! Both are challenging and you will learn a ton from both, so in the end, I don't think it matters. But the kids who do 107E and enjoy it always say it was one of their favorite classes ever.

**CS103:** This class has barely any coding. It's a math/logic/proof class. It's incredibly interesting, and I honestly thought the homework was fun (the problems are like logic riddles). It had more homework than any of the other CS classes I took (averaged closer to 6-10 hours on a Pset). Was between a medium and hard class, but the midterm and final were weirdly easy.

**CS109:** Also had barely any coding. Honestly, think of it as STATS109, cause it's primarily a math a statistics class. Slightly easier than CS103, and slightly less work. We didn't get a midterm/final but we got 24 hour long ""quizzes,"" which were harder than the CS103 tests in my opinion.

**CS221/224/229 (Andrew Ng's Classes):** These classes have awesome descriptions and you also get to learn from Andrew Ng!?!? Well, not really. The ""class"" is actually the already free Coursera course made by Andrew Ng, and when you meet on Zoom, Andrew Ng will probably only be there twice over the quarter (the rest is TAs). You can learn a lot from these classes, but I think it's kind of a joke that Stanford's ML/NN classes are just pre-existing Coursera courses.

**What Should I take After Fall?** Take CS107/E. Even if you don't major in CS, this class will make you much better at coding and will help you a lot more compared to 103/109. In terms of usefulness (regardless of your major), my ranking is 107:109:103.

**Stanford CS Pressure:** A LOT of people go into Stanford wanting to ""try-out"" CS, but don't intend on majoring in it. Before they know it, they are taking two or three CS classes a quarter, they write ""CS Major"" on their Linkedin, and they are selling their soul to Amazon and Facebook. This is a result of Stanford's culture and reputation being this Silicon Valley startup machine. Please, don't let this happen to you. CS is a fantastic major, and Stanford is arguably the best place to learn. However, there are many other fantastic majors and classes, and you should not limit yourself. 

I'm a CS kid, and the most interesting classes I've taken are HUMBIO150 and this random art class about love. Furthermore, it's a growing trend amongst big tech companies to value a CS degree less and portfolios/demonstrations of skills more. You can get an amazing CS job without a CS degree if you grind. There is a lot of knowledge Stanford offers that isn't as easily obtainable online.

Just out of interest.. I'm not trying to fulfill any requirement, or move abroad.

I'm wondering the differences between the two? (I've never taken a foreign language class at Stanford)

(One obvious difference is that they teach different languages, duh)

How are language classes formatted on Zoom? Is there still a speaking requirement / how do you speak up on a video conference with a bunch of people?

I'm wondering if Gerlang series is geared towards people who are more interested in completing their language requirement rather than acquiring the language?

2nd year Dutch is SPECLANG, so does that mean it is structured differently / less structured overall compared to Gerlang, which is more established?

I assume Gerlang has a lot of undergrads for the majority. Also, just out of general curiosity, what profile/kind of person would take 2nd year Dutch?

If it matters, I think my placement for Gerlang would be somewhere in the first year series. I did not take the first year Dutch class offered last year, so I'm not sure if I will qualify to take the second year class. I was exposed to the language when living in a Dutch speaking place many years ago.. not sure how much I retained up till today.

I'm an incoming fromsh hoping to do a math major alongside pre-med. 

I have been recommended by many people to take the 61CM series this year. It sounds very interesting, however, I do not have any experience with proofs. I looked at the midterm and did not comprehend any of it. I looked at the Math 51 final and could answer about 1/3 of the questions.

I have taken multivariable calculus but not linear algebra. I found it quite easy (I think I got about a 97 in the class, and a 99 on the final through Stanford's ULO program). 

I will be taking Math 56 this fall also. Normally I would take the more challenging course since that's what makes my brain happiest, but I am worried it might be too challenging, plus I want to get good grades for pre-med (an unfortunate constraint).

I hear so many great things about the Frosh year at Stanford. And being someone who comes from a high school of 70 kids, with a senior class of 18, in a town without much to do,  I never really had much experience even being a teenager or doing teenager things like simply going out with friends. My friends were all from school but none of us were especially close and we were all pretty focused on school + extracurriculars + getting into good colleges.

I was lucky enough to be granted on-campus housing so I'll be able to live there with other students, but in my gut it still all just feels like a let down because of the virus. This was going to be the first time in my life I would even have the opportunity to have any semblance of ""fun"" or close-nit friendships.

People tell me that I should be grateful that I'm going to *\~\~Stanford\~\~*, or that it's going to be great any way because it's *\~\~Stanford\~\~*, or that at the end of the day I only have good decisions to make (on whether to gap or not) because it's *\~\~Stanford\~\~*, but it just doesn't feel that way to me.

I wanted to have a Frosh dorm experience, I wanted to be one of the people in those pictures on the Stanford website where they're all standing arms together, I wanted to be able to form connections with people, I wanted some amount of adventure after years of feeling burnt out from the tedium of driving to school, doing work, driving to extra curriculars, and driving home. I fear that after years of waiting for college to come, the rug has been swept out from under me.

I am literally so conflicted as to what I should be majoring in because quite honestly, there are way too many things that I am interested in at Stanford.

My original plan was to double major (CS + Mechanical Engineering or CS + Econ) with CS being the primary major as I heard that CS is one of the most valuable degrees that you can get at Stanford. However, I heard today that CS and MechE have a lot of courses in common that you can't count twice for both majors.

I thought about CS + Econ as well (with Econ first as a minor), but somebody told me that the Econ major is literally the Econ minor + some more electives. I thought about doing that, but I heard the CS major is pretty intensive in units and I'm worried I wouldn't be able to satisfy my WAYS requirements if I did this.

Also a note about coterms: I'm definitely hoping to do one - I was planning originally to do a CS Major and either Econ/MechE double major, and then do MS&amp;E as my coterm major. However, I was told that it might be a better idea to do MechE or Econ major and then coterm in CS... what should I do?

If it helps, I definitely hope to go into either tech entrepreneurship and eventually finance (Investment Banking, Venture Capital, or consulting). I helped launch a startup this summer, which made me realize the value of an education in CS and MechE. However, is an econ degree really necessary to work in finance? Also, how hard is it to get into the MS&amp;E Coterm?

I'm an incoming international Frosh and I plan to major in CS. During high school, I was enrolled in my country's own board so I don't really have AP credits. When I checked the CS course requirements in explore degrees, it's stated there that I need to either take Math 19, 20, and 21 or waive that requirement with AP credits.

Now, I've taken my placement test and it recommends me to take Math 51 but I'm at least planning to take Math 21 to fill in a few knowledge gaps as well. However, do I really need to take Math 19 and 20 as well? Cause that kinda feels basic and a lot of other STEM majors that I'm interested in as well require the 51 sequence only, so in that sense, CS seems to be a black sheep in the engineering department. Later, if I change my major, the Math 19 sequence wouldn't really count to the new major's math requirement. I'm just worried if I missed something and if I'm reading the CS requirement right since I'm new to all of this.

With the help of 500 user responses and several psychology papers, we created a unique profile outline that should match people based on the most important traits. We have deployed a website to gather actual user responses to match and are trying to test and validate our matching algorithm and require people to help us by reviewing their matches. By no means, is our algorithm final and we would love people who are honest and willing to help us out.

2273,Want to go back to school to get my Stanford Masters,1,2020-09-08 00:21:47,0,"  

Had a very non traditional route -&gt;govt-&gt;specialized consulting 

not stanford affiliated in anyway but wanted to apply to the ms there. if not this year in the future. I want to work for a company where tech is the core of my day to day activity instead of in finance/insurance like I am right now as a consultant. I generally like programming and stats and am thinking of taking an NDO to prepare for t hat.

1) out of curiosity what are the highest acceptance rates from what people have heard for stanford masters? I imagine there aint much difference but i thought i'd ask in case there may be some programs that might have a reasonable acceptance rate and are reachable. My interests include economics, finance, near eastern languages, and cs.

2) if I don't have research experience (did premed research for a year in undergrad and had a capstone for another masters I did). Work in NYC. How can I possibly get a remote research position at Stanford? A lot of the CS specialities aren’t really strong here in the NYC area. I am not a student currently and have been working, which seems atypical for research positions.

3) Taking NDO courses seems to be risky, as there isn’t much pay off or guarantee as far as Masters admissions. Took Calc in a T10 undergrad. Haven’t really taken done linear algebra which is a requirement for the MSEng. Should I jump into Math52? It’s difficult because you can go two or three elvels  into preqrequisites based on stanfords class listing requirement. The Stanford counselors don’t seem helpful in this regard in helping you choose courses and just refer you to the ‘pre-requisites’ which for programs like MSCS aren’t clear.

So if you can see my dilemma: on one hand Math52 is a pre-req to a program I’m interested in and yet I like other courses such as those that can help me in interviewing (data structures algorithms 106A

) or jobs (ie networking). So which NDO courses should I take pre-reqs or something just to prove my chops? Should I take one or two just to get a good grade and prove I have the chops?

2283,Advice for Incoming Frosh,1,2020-09-08 19:40:40,9,"Some advice for incoming frosh: 

Coursework: Don't drown yourself in classes. Every year, many frosh end up overcommitting academically in fall quarter, despite advice from upperclassmen and academic advisors. Most people will tell you that the best part about Stanford is the people, and it's true. It's difficult to make the most of the Stanford community when you're bogged down with homework and deadlines. Take the time to meet as many people as possible, even if it's virtually!

Introsems: Take them! A great way to interact with professors and your peers in a more intimate setting. [introsems.stanford.edu](https://introsems.stanford.edu)

Academic Progress: You're not in a race with your peers. Don't stress if you feel that others are ahead of you in a course sequence, have coded since high-school or have written 10,000-word research papers. Everyone completes their degree at a different pace, so take your time and take advantage of Stanford's many tutoring and advising resources. Do yourself a favor and go through Stanford at your own pace – more on this below. 

Classes: As many of you will know from high school, it can be easy to get by in some classes without really engaging with the material or learning much from the course. This is also the case for some courses at Stanford. Stanford has world-renowned professors and incredible courses, so make the most of them. The more you put into your classes, the more you'll get out. If you're taking lots of heavy classes in one quarter, you'll quickly find that it can be difficult to stay fully engaged with each course. 

Fast Courses: A faster way to browse through courses than Carta: [https://fastcourses.org](https://fastcourses.org)

Extracurriculars/Student Organizations: Student organizations are a great way to meet people with similar interests and are a cornerstone of many students' undergrad experience. Attend the virtual activities fair and learn more about Stanford's many student organizations. Like classes, don't overcommit yourself and take time to explore organizations that interest you. Feel free to drop a club commitment if it's too much and also know that some student organizations welcome students joining at any time of the year.

Language Requirement: Review the language requirement and think about when you want to start your language course sequence. You can fulfil the requirement anytime during your undergrad career, but some students prefer completing the language course sequence early on. [https://language.stanford.edu/academics/language-requirement](https://language.stanford.edu/academics/language-requirement)

Majors/Minors: Four years is more than enough time to be successful in your major and maybe even pick up a minor or two along the way. Note that if you're considering a double major, you'll have a little  less flexibility with your course selection and more planning is needed earlier on. Having said that, most Stanford undergraduates end up with one major. As mentioned above, if you need to space out difficult major classes over a couple of quarters rather than doing 2-3 core courses in one quarter, give yourself that space. Again, it's not a race. 

Four Year Plans: I won't say too much about these other than they can be useful for some students as a reference point but are likely to change as new courses are offered each year. If you're curious about your progress towards a certain major, read the undergraduate handbook for your major department and speak with your academic advisor. 

WAYS Requirements: If you have extra space in your schedule, consider taking a class that fulfils a certain WAYS requirement. Don't worry too much about this during frosh year, but it can be useful to know what the requirements are and where they'll roughly fit into your undergrad career. [https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/ways/about-ways](https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/ways/about-ways)

Final Note: Take courses you enjoy, do things you love, and be true to yourself. You got into Stanford for a reason, and remember that reason is different from everyone else's. Some weeks will be harder than others, some quarters might not go to plan, but keep at it with an open mind and a willingness to work hard, and you'll thrive here at Stanford.

First, email the financial aid office with the following email:

1. Ask the exact date when you will receive your letter.
2. Succinctly explain why your personal situation means you need to have this clarity/visibility now rather than wait till later.
3. Thank them for their help.

Keep it short; the whole email shouldn't be more than just one paragraph.

===========================

If no response within a business day, or if they give a vague response, reply and cc the manager (Carl, email address is carlg2). You can attach a short message like ""bumping this message in case you missed it. "" + reiterate your original message. You can also mention that you're cc'ing Carl.

===========================

If no response, reply and cc Carl's manager (Ronald, email address is rondiaz) with the same routine.

And so on...

Keep escalating up the manager chain (but don't escalate all the way up to MTL obviously).

When you are done escalating to a high enough level, just keep following up every 1-2 days by replying to the entire email chain that includes everyone who you've escalated to so far.

ALWAYS be polite, but also be firm about your request.

im not suuuper keen about joining groups like stanford finance/BASES/kudla fund/AKPsi etc. because idk if i want to spend my limited time at stanford thinking and talking about things that i will anyways be thinking and talking about at my job after stanford (would much rather spend time doing research w cool profs/at the cantor arts centre)

but before i make that decision i want to know for sure how much im missing out on by not joining preprofessional groups? will gman sachs even consider me if i am not a Stanford Finance VP ;\_;

obviously my uncertainty comes from a place of knowing pretty much nothing about recruiting, what companies are looking for etc. so again pls dont roast me thank u

In this class I'm taking, I thought I had a pretty good understanding of the first lecture. I noticed someone was struggling with it, and he posted a request asking for a tutor, and I was sort of expecting that because I could tell he want getting it during OHs. I want to help, and I definitely do not want him to pay me, I just want to explain the lecture in my own words to him hoping he'll get it. During undergrad I did that a lot with some of my classmates and I like to think I'm pretty good at breaking things down (if I understand them). 

But the thing is, if you understand the lecture, the first assignment becomes pretty easy. Really easy. My fear is that in a way, it could be seen as unpermitted aid? And that's a violation of the honor code. I really feel bad not being able to help when I know I can but I don't want to get in any trouble, especially since I just started here. 

I also can't guarantee that I'll understand all future material in the course the way I understand the first lecture, so I don't want to come helping now only to disappear later on. And I'm also worried about being persuaded to just ""attempt"" the assignment while I'm teaching him if he still doesn't get it. So I guess this is more of a soft skills question too.

Would you advise me to just mind my business and hope another TA helps/he finds a paid tutor who can help him? Or do you think I should say something? And what steps do you think I should take to ensure I don't put myself in trouble?",0.18189898989898992,0.5590707070707069,stanford

I am enrolled in Spanish 1, but after a few days I figured I was too ahead of my class to be fit there.

I do have a background with Spanish. I worked with a lot of agricultural workers in lemon and avocado fields. I’m super good at listening and reading for comprehension, and less so for details and literary devices. The only thing is I have a horrible stutter when I speak Spanish. I used to have a bad stutter as a kid, although I never received help for it, it went away. When I try to actually speak Spanish, I can’t even get a sentence out. It gets stuck in my throat.

The most I can do is answer my professor when I’m called on, and help my classmates when they’re stuck. But I can’t have a reciprocal conversation.

The online test felt okay. I thought I did as well as I could have. But my performance in the Oral Interview was so bad that my interviewer just switched to English for the last parts of the interview. 

They said I was too stressed, anxious, and needed more practice and that I would stay in Spanish 1. My only issue was with speaking so I asked if I could be moved to Spanish 1A, so I could be with people who were more proficient with the language so I could try to catch up. But they said that it’d probably be better if I just stayed where I was.

Econ 1, i dont rlly have complaints? Its fine. Taylors kinda boring w his lecs but I kinda do enjoy the textbook/content itself, but reading does get tedious. Its offered every quarter so i guess i could take it later..?

2502,Pod system is misguided,1,2020-09-26 21:32:12,7,"[Context](https://stanforddaily.com/2020/09/22/stanford-to-allow-students-to-form-pods-some-indoor-instruction-to-resume/): 

&gt;Furr wrote that students living in on-campus residences will be allowed to form “households” or “social pods,” comprising no more than eight students, within housing facilities. Social pods will be required to register with Stanford to “facilitate contact tracing.” Those living in social pods will be able to interact with each other “as would members of a household”— effectively allowing students to interact with up to eight community members without social distancing or having to wear masks, provided they are distanced from other pods. 

OCH email yesterday:

&gt;Just as an FYI, further clarification on the new guidelines for how to make and register “households” of 8 people will be released early next week, so please keep your eyes peeled for that important information. 

It is a good thing that the University has taken student concerns about mental health an the overall strictness of the compact seriously. But I don't think officially registering a ""pod"" makes very much sense. Friendships and romantic relationships can change unpredictably. Forcing people to pre-register these creates some of the same problems associated with the original draconian version of the rules, and it puts people in a very uncomfortable position of having to rank their personal relationships and negotiate with others.

It's also, simultaneously, a bit too permissive. With the caveat that the full set of rules haven't been published yet, 8 people is a lot and if these pods cut across actual households (people who live together) you can end up ""linking"" a *lot* of people. Just a probably-not-typical example to prove a point: Say you have a bunch of households of *m* people, each person in each household is a member of a different pod. Worst case:

1. You're directly exposed to up to 6 + m people
2. You're two degrees away from up to another 14(m-1) people
3. You're three degrees away from 49(m-1)+ 6m\^2. 

For m &gt; 2, this is pretty bad. My point here isn't that it increases a lot in *degrees* (this is always the case) but it increases rapidly in *m*. This can be mitigated by limiting the number of unique pods per real household, but that makes the negotiation problem so much worse. Not only do I have to rank my friends, but I have to take my roommates and my friends' roommates priorities into account? Maybe if we give Paul Milgrom a few years and a juicy research grant he can solve this problem. (Also note that more restrictions on pods --&gt; more people seeing eachother against the rules --&gt; more cross-household linkage.)

A better alternative would be something like: You can visit *n* number of people outside your household a week, or between negative tests.\* Outdoor 6-foot interaction with masks would not count. And even for indoor interaction that counts, the rule should be **wear masks unless you're doing something which prevents it**. Putting a piece of cloth on your face is such a small ask compared to everything else.

You could of course debate what *n* should be, whether Stanford and non-Stanford people should count the same way, and it would of course be hard to enforce. But I submit that pretty much any problem with this system is also going to occur with the pods. The proposed alternative could be implemented as a ""pod"" system where you can update your pod every week. That sounds more complicated but I would argue it's actually a lot easier, because the stakes are just who you see that week.

\---

\*Since test results can be delayed, in practice the rule might just be per week, but you have to be getting tested weekly and everyone has to have been negative on their last result.",0.00481392876129718,0.48241892610313664,stanford

I am a freshman here enrolled virtually. As someone who struggles with time management, it’s been really really bad this quarter. I recently just failed a quiz because I couldn’t submit it on time. I am so far behind on material in 3/4 of my classes. I already used the free “late days” for half my classes that offer that. Plus, I am not one to actively make friends especially during this pandemic so virtually this has been tough socially.

Overall, I feel very behind and am not happy with my current status.

My question is, is what are my options going forward for the quarter/year. I really wanted to gap but my parents wouldn’t let me. Is this still a possibility? Can i drop out and enroll in next years class without having these courses on my transcript? If I take a LOA, what does that entail with my transcript?

I've always liked an interdisciplinary mix of technical/grounded and creative/artistic, and am thinking of going into design. I have a bit of experience from high school, but it's limited. Product designer or UI/UX designer looks like a career that'd fit my interests really well, if it's something I can get good at

I could continue with CS HCI track (HCI's relevant to UI/UX and since I finished most of the code heavy classes, wouldn't be too bad?)

or switch to Product Design (I'm not as interested in the required meche stuff, would be bad at it too. But PD seems to have more projects/teach actual harder design skills than HCI. If anyone has details about how meche/engineering heavy PD is, that'd be helpful). 

or PD major + CS coterm in HCI. or double major since PD has no minor, though that doesn't sound fun. But I do kind of want to keep CS, in case design doesn't work out, so I have SWE as a safety net. 

Symsys is not an option, I'm not interested in the required phil/cogsci classes.

You can find out more about the study here: [http://fullerton.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_emaleTw8WK9KX8V](http://fullerton.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_emaleTw8WK9KX8V)

You are eligible for the study if you are: (a) At least 18 years old; (b) attending a college or university in the United States; and (c) available and willing to complete both baseline and follow-up surveys.

The study will ask you to complete: 

* 1 Baseline survey (approximately 30-45 minutes), followed by
* 3 Follow-up surveys (approximately 15 minutes), which take place every two weeks.  

These surveys will ask you about such topics as your stressors and coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic, mood and anxiety symptoms, health, and academics.  The study closes on December 11, 2020.

Overall, your total expected time commitment is about 1.5 hours.

**Compensation**

The following compensation applies to participants that are *not* part of the CSU Fullerton Psychology Department Research Pool:   


* For completing the baseline survey and all three follow-up surveys by December 11, 2020:
   * If you are the one of the first 25 participants to complete the requisite surveys, you will earn a $20 Amazon gift certificate;
   * If you are not one of the first 25 participants to complete the survey, you will be entered into a drawing for a $30 Amazon gift certificate.  **(Odds of winning: maximum 1 in 3)**
* *Note:* 
   * **You must start the study no later than October 30, 2020** in order to be able to complete all four surveys in time.
   * As explained in the informed consent form, survey entries that are flagged as reflecting unusually poor effort will not count towards compensation.",0.04189814814814815,0.47932098765432113,stanford

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; a couple of Stanford alums and I wanted to help students save their favorite memories especially at a time like this so we made an absolutely, completely, no bull-sh\*ttingly free one-line-a-day journal just for that.

I'm super lazy and have tried to journal multiple times. Bullet journals, one entry at night, one entry at day, etc, etc. Tried everything. At the beginning of quarantine, all of our days were beginning to mush together and I was losing track of what specific day of the week it was. It was just pset after pset and I literally was keeping track of my days by what number pset for CS 161 I was on. And then my friend hit me up about his one line journal idea and that's how we got started working on our journal!

Inspired by my friend's approach to his four years here, we made something that let's you save one ""gold nugget"", or one favorite memory, from your day to our app. We tried to make it as effortless and easy as possible so even the laziest and most forgetful people like myself still log one line a day. It's really just as simple as that.

No, it doesn't have ads. Nor does it have some kind of premium service (idk we haven't really thought about how to make money off of this). This has been our pure product of labor for the past few months and we just wanted to help Stanford students save their best memories in a place where you can go back and reminisce all about how you and your friends accidentally ran a stop sign and got pulled over by campus police or that time you went to your first screw-your-roo. We really want Stanford students to savor their experience even if it isn't on campus. With the quarter system being so brutal and Stanford's constant go go go mentality, it's super easy to just let the four years rush on by without stopping to remember all of your moments. So, we hope this can help with that. 

It would mean the world to us if you downloaded it from whatever platform you're on and gave us feedback! Absolutely roast us on the review if you thought it sucked or praise it and give it five stars!

I'm a freshman that got on campus housing due to personal circumstances. Since coming here, I've found it to be a really isolating experience. Probably doesn't help that I'm shy to begin with and have a tough time initiating social interactions absent some kind of shared experience. The classes are really hard (Chem and Math in particular) and I feel like there's almost no social life to speak of. I haven't really been able to meet anyone. Since we can't really hang out and classes are all virtual, there's no real organic situation that would lead to friendship and I can't say that I've made any real friends here in the month that I've been here. My roommate is great but also just studies a lot in their room too. I've been rejected from pretty much all of the clubs and orgs that I applied to. The food isn't great and there are no activities at all. It almost feels like a prison of sorts and it's hard not to spend all day in your room doing homework, listening to zoom lectures, and meeting no one. Basically, I just feel lonely, lame, dumb, overworked, friendless, and sad. I was so looking forward to Stanford and obviously no one expected this. And though I know it's irrational, I now often wonder if this is how it's just going to be for us and truly feel like an imposter on top.

Frosh here. My parents just told me that they aren't sure we can afford Stanford for the rest of the year. We don't currently receive any financial aid, but their income dropped 30k (now sitting around 70k/year, but we own our house so that is why we don't get FA). They said that if there isn't another option then I can work and we will find a way for me to continue at Stanford (but I don't want to do this because I'd hate to put that burden on my parents). 

Their preference, however, would be for me to take a LoA for the rest of frosh year and take community college courses so that I can come in with sophomore standing (thus reducing how much they have to pay). Is this even possible?

Otherwise, are there any other options? Could I apply for FA this late? The thing I am also considering is dropping out and taking community college and then transferring to a UC, but so far I have fallen in love with Stanford's community and it would break my heart to have to leave it so soon.",0.06136363636363637,0.633080808080808,stanford

I am not sure whether to continue with electrical engineering or switch to computer science.  Also, if it matters- I may consider a Masters (too early to say for sure). I think double major may be too much work and don't really like computer architecture to pursue CE (plus I heard it it spreading yourself thin and makes you less knowledgeable about either field). I also don't know if a minor will have enough info for a job.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I think my favorite parts of EE so far are the things to do with coding, like working with arduinos and what not. I took two CS classes thus far and I liked them but I am not sure how it would translate to a career. I don't find myself too interested in the EE stuff but I am not sure if it's because I am only learning the general stuff like digital logic and RLCs right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I am also working on some side software projects as part of school orgs which I enjoy. I would also try hardware but it’s limited due to the pandemic.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I think I am more interested in CS but don't care \*too\* much about what I do (I think) but I do want job security or secure future essentially.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to list some pros and cons that I have for each side and I would really appreciate any advice at all related to any of the following points

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

CS (Pros)

&amp;#x200B;

\* Higher salary and more potential to make money (or startup)

\* More diverse in terms of career field (healthcare, tax, every industry needs it)

\* Job outlook seems to be good by sources online

\* Field is very much growing like in areas of AI and Machine Learning (which are somewhat interesting to me)

&amp;#x200B;

CS (Cons)

&amp;#x200B;

\* Can be outsourced more easily (considering the work done can be done so from anywhere),

I would also love some more light on this

\* I would never be secure, I would always have to stay on my toes learning new technologies. I would get less competitive as I grow older when compared to younger candidates. Sure I love learning now, but eventually I feel I would want to relax a little due to being closer to the top of the game (\*\*it's one of my biggest concerns relating to job market\*\*)

\* It's an easier degree and a lot of people have it. It's easier to do CS with an EE degree than EE stuff with a CS degree

\* You also don't really need a degree (so I have heard)

&amp;#x200B;

EE (Pros)

&amp;#x200B;

\* Less likely to be outsourced due to the nature of the field

\* It's a harder degree so less people have it

\* Can do CS stuff but not vice versa

\* Seniority is not a disadvantage as it may be in CS. Seniority is actually beneficial and desired

&amp;#x200B;

EE (Cons)

&amp;#x200B;

\* I don't feel like I am very interested (but this might be due to only covering general topics so far)- although I do like the integration of hardware and coding

\* Unemployment is higher in EE and the job outlook is not as great as CS

\* The salary on average/median also seems to be lower

This would mean that the $16,000+ (full fin aid package) on our award letters set aside for room and board, would be added to our annual gross income and we would need to pay a couple thousand in taxes on. Whether you work or not, this would make you non-exempt and means you must file taxes (or your parents if you're dependent still). This doesn't include all the other non-qualified scholarships you might receive, which should also be taxed and added to gross income. I don't think education credits can cover this amount of tax.

i don't know how to gauge if I like ms&amp;e because I won't be taking any ms&amp;e classes til after freshmen year so I am sticking with cs classes for now. the HCI and information CS track seems really interesting so I am going for that.

2847,Schoodule,1,2020-11-10 21:43:17,4,"Hey Cardinals!

I've been working on a small project, Schoodule, to help with my workflow for classes and coursework. 

It's a desktop website that serves as a scheduling tool specifically made for students.

This tool provides one location to view all bits of information regarding any course or event that you decide to schedule. You can store and find any:

* Links
* Emails
* Professors/TAs
* Office Hours
* Discussion/Labs
* Important Exam Dates

Each course/event also comes with an included to-do list for those who like to stay extra organized!

I've been using this tool for the last couple of weeks and I've found it very useful-- especially since classes are all online anyway. So, I decided to launch a small beta version for anyone who might be interested in Schoodule.

You can access it at myschoodule.com!Also, if you have any feedback or ideas for improvement, feel free to send it through the feedback section of the website! :)

Ever since I was young I was very interested in science, particularly physics and I've always intended on pursuing it in the future. My parents were happy about it because they see STEM has being the ""safe"" way for a job, especially my dad who is a scientist. But for the past 5 years or so I've been starting to have different thoughts as I experienced new things. I'm much more excited and intrigued about political science and history now. In my last 2 years of high school I was thinking that I'm not that interested or good at math, and now after almost being done with my first quarter at Stanford this thought is very much solidified. I really don't like my math and CS class right now (purely for the subject, the professors are great)- only my political science classes right now are giving me any happiness.

I guess I'm a bit nervous about switching from pursuing STEM to humanities, partially because I'm worried about career prospects and I'm worried about my parents disapproving. And also it feels weird to finally admit that I care about humanities more because whenever I had that thought I always tried to convince myself that I wanted to do STEM.

And I'm also feeling a bit regretful because now I've kind of fucked my GPA because I think I'm only going to be able to manage to get a B/B+ in my calculus/CS class. I know those classes are not very relevant to polisci so maybe it doesn't matter that much, but I guess I'm more concerned about just how my overall GPA looks on paper. Is that going to be okay if I try to get into grad school (for polisci) or maybe even law school?",0.188997742997743,0.497072927072927,stanford

How bad is this to be a pre-med? I'm sort of freaking out since that's the path I realllllly want to take. 

Also, does anyone know of places i might be able to get a neuropsych at stanford such that my parents wouldn't need to know? or someone to help me with studying strategies? this whole quarter i haven't even started learning my classes' material until the day before exams/assignments are due....which worked for the first two chem ones, but obviously not for the last one. i'm not sure why i can't focus before then and i've tried talking to my AAD to see if there might be better study methods, but it's really causing huge problems for me. i did this in HS as well but it's gotten far far worse with zoom learning because at least in HS i went to the classes.

I am freshman and have been applying to a few internships. Most actually do not ask for GPA, but some do. However, sometimes they do not ask for a transcript. Thus, if you have a CR on their, but obv your GPA is not affected by that, then aren't you at a distinct advantage then if they had to view your transcript since your initial GPA that they see is higher than if there was a letter grade there? That begs the question, would it be advantageous to pass fail a class rather than take it for a letter for the purposes of applying to an internship?

Initially, I was going to continue with the 60 series. However, I would then need to take a regular quarter in the summer, since both Math 63CM and Physics 65 are only offered in the summer. Skipping ahead would also give more time for physics electives in the future.

If I take Physics 120 instead, I can take it during the spring, along with a Think course, CS 107, possibly mandarin, and whatever else looks interesting. Then, I could have my flex quarter in the summer, taking the math class and hopefully doing physics research.

I've taken AP Physics C in high school, both mechanics and E&amp;M, and have had exposure to some introductory quantum mechanics. I don't know vector calculus or differential equations super well, but I've learned a bit and feel that I can self-study the topics over break and during the course.

My physics professor doesn't recommend doing this, since you should have learned the math before going into this, as well as the PDE course pre/coreq (which I don't plan on taking because unit count, currently planning to take 18). She also says that the 60 series gives a strong foundation, but I feel that my foundation is already pretty solid physics-wise at least, and I feel up for the challenge of skipping ahead. Also, I can always drop 120 and go back to the 60 series if I can't handle it.

1. I heard that Stanford operates on a quarter system. How does this work? (i.e. what months does each quarter occupy?)
2. As someone who is very passionate about the performing arts (percussionist), I would like to continue practice in university. Speaking as someone who does not plan to major in music, is it feasible to do recreationally with an otherwise fully loaded curriculum?
3. Can anyone majoring in engineering, specifically electrical engineering speak for the quality of the program?

I guess I'm a bit confused that there don't seem to be any more guidelines besides that, such as a rent maximum they would cover (or is that just based on how much financial aid you receive?). I.e. if there was no maximum, would people not just pick a super nice airbnb in hopes of financial aid covering it? 

Also, does anyone know if living in two separate locations would impact this (was originally planning on moving back home/somewhere rent-free for the end of the quarter if financial aid didn't pull through).

3163,Forgot how to speak English,1,2020-12-11 00:15:11,16,"This is a really odd problem.

At Stanford, back when it was in-person, I was constantly speaking English, from smalltalk in lecture, to random late night philosophical discussions, to commiserating in office hours.

Since I'm at home in virtual school, I basically lost the ability to speak English. BTW, English is my most ""advanced"" language, and I live in the US. The issue is that I speak a different language at home on a day-to-day basis.

Sure, all the media I consume is in English and I text friends in English, but I rarely ever get the chance to speak it. Throughout the quarter, I only spoke English during group project meetings, and occasional group Zoom calls with friends. Which isn't too substantial, to be honest.

The last time I was constantly speaking English was back in September, during my summer job. Recently, I was in a 1-on-1 conversation with a friend (not a group setting, so I actually have to talk), and I realized my English skills have really atrophied since September. I know what I want to say, but the correct words just don't come to my mind. Has anybody experienced this? Any tips on how to cope?

My current method is to intentionally spend time everyday talking to myself about random topics in English, so I can improve bit by bit. But I am also looking for other ways. I guess the obvious answer would be ""why don't you just video call somebody?"". I do, but I guess 1 hour per week isn't sufficient.",0.045686026936026934,0.3311728395061728,stanford

3204,Double Major in CS and English,1,2020-12-14 11:19:41,21,"Hi, I’m a recently admitted freshman and I am currently intending to double major in CS and English. During the application process, I thought I would be allowed to do so at Stanford, but today I came across something on their website which made me think otherwise: 

“ student may formally declare more than one major within a single bachelor's degree (B.A., B.S., or B.A.S.) program.”

 Since English would be a BA. and CS would be a BS. would i be able to double major as I had hoped? Would that just become a BAS and then we’d be allowed to pursue both? Or how does that work? Would it not be allowed? 

I spoke to a current freshman and she said we would be able to, but since what she said conflicts with the website I wanted to confirm once again. 

I know that my major choice is going to alter once I get to campus/ online school but I’d really like to know that I *can* double major in English and CS. Otherwise maybe I should apply to other schools too where I would be able to do that. As RD deadlines are in Jan

How do I approach this with the financial aid office? Should I contact them now and tell them that I think I need extra time even though I’m a junior?

If I Google ""where is Stanford"" I get Stanford's address, which is in ""Stanford, California"".

I can't remember where but I saw that Stanford is in San Francisco? I think I Googled ""xxx near Stanford"" and all the addresses were from San Francisco. So I guess maybe Stanford is just * near * San Francisco? 

In the orientation schedule (pre-pandemic), we were supposed to go on a trip around the ""Bay Area"". Is that where Stanford is?

I see the location ""Paolo Alto"" coming up in a lot of Stanford related emails I get.

Official emails also seem to mention ""Santa Clara County"" Corona virus restrictions affecting Stanford. Is Stanford in Santa Clara County?

When I wanted to buy my ticket, the two closest Airports to Stanford were the San Jose and San Francisco airports. An apparently the San Jose Airport is closer. But I chose the San Francisco Airport because that was the only one I remember being mentioned during the virtual orientation a few months ago.

I'm a grad student on campus, and like everyone I also felt really isolated and lonely on campus this last quarter, and felt like it was a struggle to meet anyone and make friends.

      I wanted ask if anyone has gone through the same situation or know a person who did. So I matched to Stanford on December 1st, great right? About two weeks earlier I had to drop one of my three dual enrollment classes. 

Main reason(s)  that I dropped the class were two months into the course there were no assignments/papers/quizzes and class was asynchronous while revolving around a comment section for discussions. The class was barely participating and the multiple discussion threads. It was a class that was not do well online and asynchronous. I also needed to drop it by the November 18th (later moved to December 1st) deadline before needing the professors approval to drop the class. 

My grades in my other two dual enrollment classes are good and my three advanced classes at my high school are doing good too. I’m just afraid that because I didn’t get the approval for dropping the class I may be in trouble. This is increasingly worrisome knowing that if I get rescinded other college application would’ve already passed me by. 

I feel like I unintentionally did the “it’s better to ask for forgiveness than for permission” (which I don’t believe most of the time. Hopefully this is not seen and applied to my character because I’ve never had to drop a class before (let alone rearrange my schedule) and my grades have been so consistent",0.18223057644110277,0.40968671679198004,stanford

If I study between now and Summer I could definitely test out of 2, maybe 3, quarters again. This way I could do 0-1qtrs of language and be done with that requirement. 

For Korean, I could maybe test out of 1qtr, that's it (did Korean school as a kid).

I am pretty set on doing computer science on the AI track. I am starting to plan my future classes and wanted to get a feel for what courses y'all would recommend! For background, I already took Math51 and CS106B through the Stanford HSSC (high school summer college) for P/NP. Below are my planned classes below for my first 3 quarters (not including IntroSems, Ways, etc.). My general thought process was to avoid more than 2 CS classes in a quarter since they tend to be quite rigorous. My goal would be to get to the AI courses (CS 220 through 240) as fast as possible while knocking out the CS prereqs. I used this guide for help: [https://huyenchip.com/2018/03/30/guide-to-Artificial-Intelligence-Stanford.html](https://huyenchip.com/2018/03/30/guide-to-Artificial-Intelligence-Stanford.html)

&amp;#x200B;

For more background, I'm pretty comfortable with python + Java including data structures, and have finished diff eq. (the equivalent of Math52) in high school. At Stanford, I'm also hoping to mix in some cool philosophy, humbio/bioinformatics, and MS&amp;E courses. **I know that a lot of these classes may not be available in the quarters that I list below but I'm just trying to get a general feel!** Any suggestions/recommendations would be much appreciated :)

3382,Honor Code Violation as a Frosh and how to move on,1,2021-01-02 21:07:05,9,"Hello there!

I just finished my first quarter here at Stanford. I made a horrible decision during the last test of one of my classes, which ultimately resulted in the professor to write a letter of concern to the office of community standards, stating that I violated the Honor Code.

At this point, I am past the denial phase and I plan to accept the potential charges of my case.

My questions about how do I move on? I mean I know it is my first quarter here at Stanford and during my really emotionally devastating and stressful attempt to fight this process, I realized that my consequences were a lot less worse than I made them out to be and only felt more anxious about it because it seemed so bad.

I plan on retaking the class next quarter so my GPA is not complete trash. 

But I wanted to know if anyone understands how the process works beyond accepting the charges. 

I wanted to know what the possible consequences were. The judicial counselor has yet to file charges, but is it possible that the sanction agreement with them is negotiable if I don’t want to go to a panel, I mean if I chose the Early Resolution Option. My professor painted my actions and that of others involved as something that is worse than it actually is and I was wondering if the OFCS sees the standard  punishment as something that has to be done, or different for every individual case.

My actions involved indirectly mentioning a sequence used for a particular question of a test on a public platform and I was identified.

Long term, do you think that this sort of action is something that is relevant to Coterm applications. When I first signed the Honor Code earlier in the school year, I didn’t complete understand it. If I do a complete 180, do you think it is something I have to disclose to certain departments. I am not interested in medical school or law school, both of whom require disclosing Honor Code violations, but do others ask about it. I mean, I do not think I’ll be suspended for a quarter and I don’t have to explain retaking an entry level class right?",-0.06531249999999997,0.5079910714285714,stanford

I'm hesitant to reach out to housing because I lowkey want to keep the apartment to myself, so if they somehow messed up, I don't want to bring that to their attention. 

I am wondering however if anyone knows when the last day is for move-in for graduate students this quarter. I couldn't find the date online. I figure if I can figure that out, then maybe I'll know when to stop expecting her. Thanks for your help!",0.09659090909090909,0.19166666666666665,stanford

3412,CS Major looking for advice about PhD programs,1,2021-01-05 21:56:49,3,"Hey I'm a current sophomore CS major and I'm thinking of applying to CS PhD programs since freshman year, but I am not sure about the process. Now that I have a better idea about whether or not I want to apply, I thought I would post here as a first step. I think I just have a lot of dumb questions since I have only been gathering info online up to this point.

* Is there any point to coterm in CS?
* My interest is systems and I am pretty sure of it. However I noticed many CS grad school programs do not assign you to a specific lab when you come in. You have a while to rotate through labs if you want. Is there a point in taking a wide array of other classes (like AI, HCI, graphics, theory, etc), or is it better to go deep in one area (systems)? I currently only plan to take a small handful of classes in AI, theory, and graphics, and probably no classes in HCI because I don't have an interest in it and really can't bring myself. But maybe this will disadvantage me later down the line?
* I have been working in a lab in the CS department, and I will probably get a really strong rec from the PI. But since all programs require multiple rec letters, what other professors or academics should I be forming relationships with? I don't really talk with students or professors in other labs, and I am really not sure how to. Yes in theory I can get multiple rec letters from my own lab since I am working with/have worked with different professors on overlapping projects, but the letters will contain 70% the same content. So I don't think it's a great idea.
* Publications on the application: I can see several factors like being first author or not, the tier of the conference, how many papers you have, whether it's a workshop paper or conference paper, whether it's a dataset paper or not, and # of citations. How do each of these factors weigh? Like, is having 1 non first author paper at a top tier conference better than 2 first author papers at a lower tier conference?
* What are some other good resources which I can talk to? Is there like an advisor for applying to CS grad programs? I saw the VPUE advisors have med/law/etc school advising, but not for CS grad school. I have talked a bit with the grad students in my lab, but I want to gather more opinions too.
* Did anyone have experience with attending CS undergrad at Stanford and continuing into the PhD program?

I am also happy to DM.

JANUARY 9, 2021

Dear members of our Stanford community,
We are sending this weekend email to convey an unfortunate but important change in our undergraduate plans for the winter quarter.
After assessing the continuing surge in COVID-19 cases, the lengthening public health restrictions we are under, and how those restrictions likely will affect the on-campus undergraduate experience this quarter, we will not be able to have the frosh and sophomore classes return to campus for the winter quarter, as we had hoped.
Much has changed since early December, when we last updated you on our plans for the quarter. COVID-19 cases in California have skyrocketed. We are now at the worst point of the pandemic so far. Health officials said this week that before Thanksgiving, each day there were 4-5 positive COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population here in Santa Clara County. Recently, it has been approximately 50 cases per 100,000 population – a tenfold increase.
The surge has strained hospitals, leading to alarmingly low capacity in intensive-care units in the Bay Area and most of California and triggering state-mandated stay-at-home orders. Stanford’s hospital is now caring for its largest number of COVID-19 patients during the pandemic, including patients transferred from hospitals in other hard-hit parts of California. 
Amid these circumstances we have proceeded very cautiously as, in the past week, we have welcomed back graduate and professional students, as well as undergraduates with approved special circumstances. The health and safety of our community are, and must be, our top priority. Our expanded student testing program, along with our on-campus safety protocols, are aimed at supporting this critical objective of community health.
However, the worsening COVID-19 circumstances have now eroded our expectations about the experience we could deliver to undergraduates in the winter months. California and Santa Clara County have stringent public health restrictions tied to COVID-19 caseloads. When we carefully evaluated the situation in early December, we estimated that after a two-week arrival delay and a further two-week period of restricted activity, the likely relaxation of public health rules would start to allow more in-person activities, which would make it worthwhile for our frosh and sophomore classes to be on campus. 
Now, the modeling based on the most recent data available to us suggests it is unlikely that our county will be able to move out of California’s highest-risk COVID-19 “purple” tier until late in the winter quarter. That means many restrictions are likely to persist for most of the quarter. Without the ability to expand opportunities for in-person social and academic interaction to the extent we had anticipated, we do not believe we will be able to offer the kind of engaging on-campus student experience that would warrant bringing back the frosh and sophomore classes in their entirety.
We deeply regret having to change plans. We have concluded that doing so is in the best interest of students and our community, though we know many students will be disappointed. We wanted to share this information now, with winter quarter beginning Monday and many students in the frosh and sophomore classes planning to travel to campus two weeks from now.
What is next? Here are some key points:
•	Classes and student support services will continue to be fully available online, as they were in the fall. The academic continuity team will reach out to instructors who may be impacted by the change to make any adjustments needed.
 
•	All undergraduates with approved special circumstances, and undergraduate RAs, can continue to be in residence on campus.
 
•	Since some frosh and sophomores may not have applied to be in residence on the basis of a special circumstance, we will offer a new application period for those students who have not previously applied.

I was wondering how you guys were approaching meeting new people/if you are meeting new people during this time. I am currently a sophomore and I find it really hard to befriend people under the current circumstances (like most people I'm sure). It's difficult to keep in contact with people I knew on campus as well. I feel like my time at stanford is being wasted and I don't know when tf we'll be back on campus. I get kind of jealous at people who are living with friends from school and already have a friend group at stanford. It reminds me that I don't really have friends from Stanford that I can text and talk to daily. I was wondering if any of you are in the same boat? I'd love to have a check-in buddy at the very least and we can check up on each other! 
I really wanted to meet lots of people at stanford. All my friends back home are going back to their campuses, and I am feeling a bit left out even though I know it's ultimately for the best. I guess I just feel really alone, and of course, this is not what anyone wants their college experience to be.

## Link to apply:[ https://forms.gle/R7rJwEWq44zTCiL58](https://forms.gle/R7rJwEWq44zTCiL58)

### Deadline Sunday, Jan. 17 (11:59pm PST)

Are you passionate about **global development**? Do you want to learn more about global poverty and effective interventions? Apply to join One for the World’s Global Development Fellowship this winter to go in-depth into the topic of global development - we will focus on the key issues the world is facing right now in tackling global poverty. This fellowship will feature **1-on-1 mentorship, speaker events, career workshops, and mixers** to help you gain more perspectives towards this topic and meet other passionate, lovely humans. 

### What does this fellowship look like?

The fellowship will focus on a different aspect of global development each week. You will get assigned a group and a mentor to participate in weekly discussions. There will also be speaker events, career workshops, and mixers throughout the fellowship.

Topics in the fellowship include:

* **Moral agency** in global development - is it wrong not to help?
* **Economics** behind global development - how well do we understand the problem?
* **Global health and interventions** \- how can we minimize the harms of preventable diseases to the global poor?
* **Philanthropy and its effectiveness** \- what is the most effective way of helping the global poor? 
* **Human rights** \- how do first world countries and organizations like the UN affect the problem?

### Who are we?

One for the World @ Stanford is a student group dedicated to ending extreme poverty by revolutionizing charitable giving. Those in the U.S. and Stanford students especially are often the highest earners in the world, with a significant potential for outsized impact. By educating others about effective giving, we thus hope to improve the lives of people around the world.

We are a chapter of [One for the World](https://www.1fortheworld.org/), an international nonprofit organization dedicated to this same purpose. Since 2014, One for the World has motivated thousands of students to take a pledge to donate 1% of their income and has donated over $750,000 to effective charities.

The Viktor Zhdanov Fellowship gets its name from a Ukrainian virologist who was largely responsible for eradicating smallpox. He was the deputy minister of health for the Soviet Union and developed a visionary plan to eradicate the disease, which the WHO agreed to form a campaign around. 

**Questions?** 

Please reach out to [emma123@stanford.edu](mailto:emma123@stanford.edu) or [jchen23@stanford.edu](mailto:jchen23@stanford.edu) for any questions about the fellowship or One for the World @ Stanford.

I'm seriously considering taking a gap year (GY) before I enter university. (My school has done an honorable but poor job at keeping the regular caliber of my schoolwork high, and I feel a tad intellectually/academically stunted. I've also been online for a whole year now and don't want to make it two.) I have tentative plans to work/intern for most of the 15 months between HS graduation and the start of my freshman year. I am also looking for some months-long scholarship/ work-and-travel programs that are fun and intellectually engaging (LMK if you know of any!).

I'm a little uneasy to take a gap year, admittedly. Given the current geopolitical climate, innumerable complications due to the Pandemic, and my corporate inexperience, I feel that I might have very limited options. Another thing is money— my parents, understandably, are not cool with paying for all of my expenses (like rent and food) especially if the job I'm working is lower-paying and I'm essentially losing money as well. I would prefer to go abroad, but the chances of doing so could dwindle in the coming months. 

So my questions are (assuming SU allows me to defer a year)—
1. To those who have taken GYs, did you do internships/scholarship programs? If so, where?
2. Where do you think I should continue my search for GY activities?
3. Is extracurricular enrichment at all the best route to go during a gap year?

And in exchange, we’ll give you the premium version of the app for free. It’s that simple. Just email us on the App Store page or you could message me here on reddit.

So a little more background here- I actually built B4Grad with the intention of making school simple to organize. I always felt like every professor in my program had a different style of doing things, and I thought an agenda wasn’t good enough of a tool.

I hope that B4Grad can serve as a good solution to that problem for some of you. Let me know if it has.

And in exchange, we’ll give you the premium version of the app for free. It’s that simple. Just email us on the App Store page or you could message me here on reddit.

So a little more background here- I actually built B4Grad with the intention of making school simple to organize. I always felt like every professor in my program had a different style of doing things, and I thought an agenda wasn’t good enough of a tool.

I hope that B4Grad can serve as a good solution to that problem for some of you. Let me know if it has. 

Thank you 🙏",0.17779720279720282,0.4514485514485514,stanford

I’m a freshmen considering transferring after this year. Would my high school grades and SATs still matter?

I’m in the rowing team and I am the fastest on the team, but compared to rowers at Stanford, I’m not sure where I stand. My SAT was lowwww (1350) and my high school gpa was around a 3.8 unweighted and a 4.3 weighted.

1. For hiring, we got that email that said all past staphers are eligible for hire. I’d assume this is roughly 150-200 people (who are at Stanford currently), but there were only around 70 interview slots. What’s up with that?

2. It seems like almost all of the traditional activities will have to be disbanded with (campfire, disco-bingo, trivia, improv, beach day, and any other group activity). Any predictions for how camp intends in replacing these iconic activities/reconciling them during covid?

3. Camp has been pretty vague with how it’s actually going to operate. Are kids groups even going to be a thing? Are all campers going to get tested before arriving? When would staphers actually arrive at camp? Tons of questions here so im curious as to yalls thoughts. 

4. General thoughts/opinions on what SSC will be like in 2021?

3561,what to do about severe social anxiety and participation grade?,2,2021-01-19 23:26:18,2,"(i tried asking about this on more general subreddits but the most common response i got was: ""what kind of college grades you on how many times you talk in class?!??"" so i came straight to the stanford subreddit to get more direct advice. i'm sorry if it isn't really relevant). 

just to be concise, i have severe social anxiety. it's a miracle i was able to get into stanford given how severe it is (at the beginning of high school i could barely write emails). throughout hs, i got several b's and a-'s directly due to my social anxiety and inability to talk to teachers (ie: one teacher fucked up inputting my grade, but i was too scared to tell them). none of the teachers who wrote my recs knew me at all (they basically made me tell them what to write). the only reason i was able to get in was because i excelled in a couple of solitary activities. 

i thought that in college, i wouldn't be graded on participation anymore, but that isn't true. I've only been here for one quarter and have already lost a decent bit of my GPA due directly to not participating in Zoom calls (I tried really hard though, talked as much as I could :( ) all my classes this quarter grade on participation (my dumbass took introsems/seminars). it's really been taking a mental toll on me. i shake during all my zoom calls, get terrible nausea all throughout the days i have class. 

i've never believed in contacting my teachers to tell them about my social anxiety. i've always thought of it as my disease that i should take accountability for and that i don't deserve accomodations for my deficits, but honestly i can't really take it anymore. i've been getting professional help for a while now but nothing is working. i've been really hard on myself and pushing myself to get better, but it's not enough. the participation grade does not push me to talk, it just agitates and depresses me even further. 

i'm wondering if i should contact my profs/ta's about this or if it's highly unfair and inappropriate. obviously social anxiety is a larger problem that destroys my life and i need to seek deeper help, but for now, it would really help if i didn't have to live with the constant pressure of needing to participate in class.",0.05082674571805007,0.4899999999999999,stanford

I'm currently a senior (i've taken a few gap quarters so i still have time to apply for coterm) majoring in symsys (hci) and was heavily considering coterming in cs (also hci).

I think (if this quarter goes well) i'll be able to secure all 3 recs from cs professors and can also write a mad essay, so i was wondering what yall think?

3588,I may need to leave this school because this is a horrible place to fail.,1,2021-01-22 06:50:29,34,"I really like Stanford. I do. When I got here it felt like I had sleeping for a long time and finally woke up. I loved the quirky irreverence and the accomplished peers. But I can’t stand the pressure and lack of empathy just because you go to Stanford. It’s a horrible place to fail. I may need to leave because of it but before I do - has any one found a way past this? It seems like a serious issue that we never talk about. Posted this on Cardinal Confessions but it’s not a place for serious discussion. I need some advice on what to do. Do I stay or should I find another place where I can heal?

I suffer from severe suicidal depression and tried to kill myself. I got hospitalized. I suffer from PTSD after having been in an abusive relationship. I got kicked out. I tried to seek help in my hometown. I told a therapist about my attempted suicide, she felt sad. But when I told her I went to Stanford. She told me to perk up because my life wasn’t so bad because Stanford has a lot of opportunities. I could get a good job and find a spouse and that’d be the end of it. She told me people would be so impressed that I’m a Stanford graduate. When I told my psychiatrist I was worried about my grades (bottom 5%), she told me I shouldn’t worry and that I (a low-income student of color) was being another entitled Stanford student for worrying about grades so much. She told me that the Stanford name was so prestigious and everyone would want to hire a person with a fancy Stanford degree. She told me that Stanford people will always get jobs. I later went on academic probation and had my first internship rescinded because I didn’t meet GPA requirements. When I told my TA I was having trouble turning in assignments and going to class because I couldn’t get out of bed and was still adjusting to the odd impacts of extremely potent medication. He talked about how much harder his undergrad (Berkeley) was. He went on and on about how Berkeley was superior because there was no hand-holding and I was a privileged Stanford undergrad who cries because I can’t get what I want. He told me that the only difference between Stanford and Berkeley is that Berkeley had actual bite and that I would be kicked out of Berkeley had I gone to Berkeley instead. He told me that if I couldn’t take insults I should leave engineering because real engineers tell it like it is. He told me I should have majored in something like the humanities where people are always handing out compliments and only say positive happy things.

The culture is always happy. No one talks about how they’re struggling. I find it hard to make friends once they know the shit I’ve been through. One person told me “We can’t be friends because you are mentally ill and don’t have your shit together”. I told some people that I was thinking of killing myself and they brushed it off as me trying to seek attention. It’s as if people just want to be friends so that can network for prestigious careers later on. When I was doing well and had a future, I benefitted from this but when I need real friends to cry with - there’s no one. It’s as if this entire university is built for networking into flashy careers. Fake smiles and fake California valley girls abound. This place is a go-go-go atmosphere for the best students. There is no room for anyone else. We have grade inflation and support but the mentality is very much “You have so much so people dictate that you should be not just doing well but really, really, really on top of the world.” I get no sympathy from my peers for my struggles. I was an engineering major. I struggled in it but pushed on believing that it was for me. I was in every office hours. Spent 20-30 hours on so many of my problem sets. When I told students and professors this, they told me to start earlier and that I was being lazy. Professors are resentful of our safety net. I once asked a question and the professor told me Stanford holds my hand a lot but this question is so stupid that 99% of real engineers would have googled it up before asking it. Professors and graduate students hate the shit out of undergraduates. They’re generally awful teachers because they’re human beings going through a brutal and inequitable system. My friend TA’ed for a professor and he told me that the professor would take photos of undergrads who failed their exams so he could laugh at it and feel better about himself when he was going through a hard time. There is no real development. You really have to do it on your own. Only the very prepared kids can take advantage of Stanford. There’s safety net and you’ll graduate but it just feels like I’m grinding and barely staying afloat but not really getting any mentorship. I stayed 48 hours for one of my projects. I saw all the wrong signs but failed to steer clear because suffering is social currency in engineering departments. I had a professor chew me out for showing up late to lab because I couldn’t get out of bed. I went on academic probation because I couldn’t get out of bed to take any of my finals. I knew a kid who passed out from heart palpitations for drinking too much Red Bull and staying up too much. No one wants to do any spontaneous. Everyone is always busy.

I am a low-income student of color who grew up in the projects. My parents are refugees. I worked throughout all of high school to help our family stay afloat because my father became disabled and couldn’t work. I grew up thinking gunshots in the night are normal. I dressed so poorly - that I received donations in my backpack one day because concerned teachers were worried that I was going to become homeless. When I was okay, Stanford felt amazing but when I wasn’t okay (which is a lot of the time), Stanford felt god awful. Before I apply for additional quarters of financial aid, I wonder if I should because Stanford is such an awful place to fail. When I tell people I got to Stanford, people are impressed but people really assume that my life is set. This kills me. My life is not set. We talk about how privileged Stanford kids are but it hurts because I don’t feel like a human deserving empathy because I have the Stanford name. To them, Stanford means that I am a privileged elite whose life is set. As if going to Stanford can undo the trauma of being a poor person of color in America. I seriously wonder if I can pick myself back up again. Stanford was home for me but I think it might be for me. We talk about privilege but don’t talk about the serious detriments it on healing and failure. I wonder if I should do it here or elsewhere. I don’t really don’t have much to look forward to in life.

I’m the instructor of record for CS 169 on Algorithmic Game Theory, and I was hoping to get some advice about an interpersonal conflict that seems to have been going on in my class for at least the last two weeks. My course is pretty small compared to comparable classes (166, 168) and I’m generally on pretty good terms with most of the students taking my course, so I was surprised to receive a call alleging inappropriate behavior between the whistleblower’s TA and one of their classmates. I don’t remember the entire conversation, but it sounds like she called his code “beautiful”? What concerned me most was the claim that the offending student sends 5-6 private Zoom messages PER CLASS, all of them talking about his TA’s “thickness” (or they might have said “sickness” – It’s true that she contracted COVID a few weeks ago).

I sent my whole teaching team a bit of boilerplate about permitted teacher/student relationships, but I'm concerned that I might have to file a Title IX to get out ahead of this whole fiasco. So Reddit, AITA?",0.14722222222222225,0.5175925925925927,stanford

I already have an OAE letter for extra day accommodations on assignments and Ik my OAE officer said it is too late to add something on to the OAE letter for the ADHD. 
He said that special circumstances can ask for more time... I’m just wondering what the best way to ask for more time is?!

3644,What Track to Apply for ICME Masters?,1,2021-01-29 02:16:00,0,"Hi all,

I'll be applying to the ICME masters program next year, and I am looking for advice on whether I should apply to the data science vs. computational finance track. I am a CS/Stats major with SWE internships, so my profile is much more suited for the data science track. However, I am seeking a masters because I want to transition into quant finance, so my top choice is comp. finance, but I have 0 prior internships in finance.

Some questions I have are:

1. Which track should I apply to, given that (i) my top choice is the finance track, (ii) I have no finance work experience, and (iii) my profile is much more relevant for data science?
2. Is it possible to switch tracks once you're in the program? If so, I am thinking it might be a good idea to apply to data science, but I've also heard there are far more applicants for DS than there are for finance, so I might have better chances applying to finance in this case.

3656,Just wanted to put this out there,1,2021-01-30 12:04:02,8,"I guess this is me trying to express what I'm feeling in an effort to give me a sense of relief; that these feelings don't exclusively exist within me, that they're somewhere out there (albeit on a hard-drive on some server). Although I'd appreciate any advice or comments, soliciting them isn't my intention.

I'm currently living on campus with my friends. I love them all; they're incredibly chill, full of energy and fun to be around. But as an international student, I feel out of place. There are so many references that go over my head, like the cartoons and TV shows they watched growing up, the music hits of middle school and vines that I've never been exposed to. It feels really hard to relate or contribute to conversations. Often, I feel like I have no opinions about things. My friends would debate which Miley Cyrus song is the best banger or which Disney channel actor/actress turned to be the hottest as they grew up. I've never really thought about those things, and don't understand the circumstances that would force one to, yet my friends seem to have immediate strong opinions about these things and have come up with lines of reasoning explaining their positions. Coupled with the fact that half the time I don't know what they're debating, it always feels like I'm just an observer in the friend group. I feel like they forget I exist, and by extension I feel like an outsider.

It doesn't help that I already have issues with active listening, vocabulary recall or expressing myself on the spot. English is not my first language, and I've only been conversing in it for a few years. This is also exacerbated by the fact that 18 years of living with a manipulative, hot-tempered mom has taught me to be agreeable and actively seek to please the people around me. I often just nod, smile or laugh, not knowing what for. These reflexes seem to be programmed in me. Whenever I try to overcome them, try to be true to myself, I'm hit with self-worth issues. Nothing about my life, at least to me, seems worth sharing. I don't have any funny anecdotes, while my friends always seem to have something funny that's happened to them recently. Adding to that, I hate my body, every bit of it. Although I know that my friends don't view my as ugly per se, they always throw around the word ""fat"" negatively. It makes me question if that connotation carries in the way the see me.

Perhaps the only time where I'm truly able to be ""me"", is when I'm drunk or high. So whenever I have the chance to, I always get really drunk, and try to get everyone around me to be drunk. It's the only time where I know I have an excuse if I say something that people would conventionally deem stupid or of no value to the conversation. Heck, my friends would just laugh because they're drunk. It's the only time where I can say the word ""like"" six times in the same sentence because I don't know what the English word for the specific thing I'm trying to describe is. People would think I'm just too drunk, that I'm not dumb. This has been very unhealthy because drinking alcohol or smoking weed seem to ruin my mood for the next few days.

So, even though I'm surrounded by people I love and admire, who I know I can count on, I feel alone. I don't know how I'd ever bring this up to them. Hell, saying this makes me question if they really see me as a friend or they just keep me around because I'm a ""generally nice person"". And the thing is, I know they're good people, but I also know that they wouldn't know how to respond or act if I ever told them this. I don't even know how to begin expressing myself, like would I call a ""friend group meeting"" and put myself under the spotlight? That just seems too dramatic. Even if I manage to do that, I know the moment I start to speak, my entire vocabulary will just disappear, my thoughts and feelings will no longer feel valid or worth listening to. I can't bear the feeling of making anyone feel even a little bit bad or sad. My whole life prior to Stanford was walking on egg shells trying not to trigger my mom, not to have her throw shit and break shit, not to hear her scream and stop talking to me for days on end.

All of these things, and many other things, compounded with school work and fucking PWR2 (that seems to incorporate even more work than a normal year would have) serves only to fuel sixty different voices in my head that I have no control over. I can't stop thinking. I can't stop hating myself, hating the circumstances that made me the way I am, hating every piece of my existence. Closing my eyes, and imagining my existence melt away is the only thing that brings me peace. I don't know what to do with myself. I've been trying so hard, but there's very little left in me. I'm depleted.
