12,"Petition to remove the ""Things Change"" signage from my roommate (a former student)",1,2020-03-01 19:03:25,18,"Evening all,

My roommate bounced from UCR this year because he was a music major unhappy with the administration's treatment of the Arts department on campus. When he walked through campus with me a week ago, he saw the art installation for the first time and was... let's say unhappy. He just started a petition to get rid of the ""Things Change"" signs and recycle the metal to put some funds back into the department. Now we all know the odds of the administration actually doing it, but if you want to put your name down both to hopefully get their attention and let them know how unhappy we are with their decision, feel free to sign. Good luck with your upcoming midterms and finals!

I know the office has been starting on contracts since the start of March, but I just called the office, and they said I should hear back by April at the latest.

167,Amount of Summer Financial Aid at UCR,1,2020-03-08 15:58:14,5,"I want to take summer courses because I'm trying to follow the pre-med track as an engineering major but the one thing that's limiting me is money since my EFC is pretty low. If anyone can help answer these questions or give any other advice for summer classes that would be very helpful!  
1. I've read that taking only 8 units a session gives me ""partial"" student aid while taking 12 units a session will give me ""full time"" student aid. Is this true?   
2. Can I expect to get the same amount of aid as I do during the school year? I'm currently a 1st year, so my tuition and half of housing are covered by grants while the rest I pay through student loans and out of pocket.  
3. Is the financial aid I request over the summer taken from my upcoming fall, winter, and spring aid? As in, will I get less money over the next school year if I request some aid for summer classes?  
4. Lastly, if I try to take classes at a different UC, will I get less financial aid over there compared to taking it at UCR? I wanted to take classes at UCI because of distance and they also have the ""pay for only 8 units max"" program this summer.

I assume I'm not able to get any jobs bc of my lack of experience (all of my board positions, internships, and volunteering are from HS cause I'm a 1st yr) and maybe possibly my schedule (I've been taking 17-19 units so far). 
I really do need a job for spring quarter otherwise I'll lose my work study but I'm not sure what more I can do. Anyone have any other tips or idea to help this poor 1st year soul out? Thanks!",-0.005357142857142854,0.5319444444444444,riverside

 1. **All Winter 2020 finals will be conducted online**  

 Online Proctoring is not an option because it is too late

2.  **All Classes for Spring 2020 are now mandated to be online, start to finish** 

Powerpoints with audio overlayed is the recommended option to professors. 

Zoom or Skype will be used

With the complete shutdown of the university starting next week (finals week) would students not be able to exchange their books for a portion of what they paid for during Winter 2020?

I assume that the bookstore would allow students to bring their textbooks from their Winter 2020 classes and the bookstores would buy them back sometime in the future; but if someone knows about something otherwise please let me know!",0.06038961038961039,0.27922077922077926,riverside

I know this is a sentiment shared by a lot of people including several posters on here who posted about completely giving up on the quarter. Some people might accuse them of being lazy or unmotivated, but I completely understand. Finals and classes in general seem so inconsequential and pointless in the grand scheme of things while worrying about parents, siblings, and other family members (especially those at high risk) some of whom are thousands of miles away in other countries or states. Some students as well as family members are facing unemployment as the stock market collapses and the service industry as well as the school itself completely shuts down. In the midst of all of this professors are assigning absurdly challenging finals exams to supposedly eliminate cheating while simultaneously pushing students towards academic dishonesty to have any hope of doing well (destroying curves and ultimately only hurting honest students). Meanwhile school administrators are on paid vacation as we pay full tuition to take online classes.

566,UC Davis vs UC Riverside vs Cal Poly SLO,1,2020-03-20 14:24:47,6,"So I was recently admitted to UC Riverside as a Computer Science major. Along with that, I was also admitted to Cal Poly SLO as a statistics major (intending to pursue the cross-disciplinary program with the data science minor) and UC Davis as a Computer Science &amp; Engineering major. My dream is to become a data scientist for the NBA in the sports analytics field.

I have seen various posts on Reddit that show that you can either major in statistics or computer science for a data science career but I'm not sure which one to choose. I know that computer science has a lot more opportunities for jobs and internships but I am hearing mixed reviews about the quality of education regarding CS at Davis and Riverside (most were from the subreddits). I also know that Cal Poly SLO has a great stats department but I am scared that I have would have fewer internships and job opportunities since stats and data science are only a subsection of CS. So my questions are:

* What is your honest opinion about the quality of education regarding CS at UC Riverside?
* Is it worth being part of the UCR Honors program as a CS major?
* Does UC Riverside CS prepare you for internship and job opportunities?
* Are UC Rvierside CS students able to get good internship and job opportunities?
* Is it better to major in CS or stats for a career in data science?
* In your opinion, what would your decision be with the schools that I have laid out?

I want to get as much information as possible before I make a decision. Thank you all for your time!",0.2125,0.5347222222222222,riverside

I seriously feel because we are not seeing each other face to face they increased the difficulty of the curriculum, curved unfairly, and curved down. The grading on assignments has been insanely tough and the finals were much more difficult. I know what their excuse is... students will look up answers and they are trying to prevent that. How about the students who don‚Äôt do that and actually studied because they care to learn and want to generally succeed in the class. In OChem lab8b I had a 218/240 and according to him a 220/240 and a perfect on the final (which is not hard to get since he gives the questions and answers to the final beforehand) is a guaranteed A. But since the final was canceled I would of figured he would of been more generous on the grading for everyone... the right thing to do and I don‚Äôt want anyone to say differently. He ends up giving my score a B... not even a B+. I was flat out curved down two letter grades. Someone I know who did much lower then me in labs also got a B. How does this standardized BS work anyways!!!! Cause obviously it‚Äôs not working. I busted my ass in lab and I feel like I been punched in the nose. In ochem8b lecture I beat both midterms averages by 34%. Friends I know who got below average on both midterms still received passing grades. You would assume if being really below average on midterms is a C-, being above both midterms by 34% is what an A+? A? Well no I got an A- and have no idea what happened to the curve with me. I know they purposely passed more people this year because of the inability to take the final but there is definitely a unequal spread of a curve. Share the wealth!?!?! I want to be curved generously too. Why do I miss out? I wanted a 4.0 not 3.7 I worked really hard in your class ya know. Is that considered fair I‚Äôm really happy a lot of people got to pass but why couldn‚Äôt I get that A since I was also unable to take the final and show out what I learned in your class. Finally there is biology and the questions that were given to us were on some MCAT stuff. Midterms were child‚Äôs play compared to it. I wont get in depth with it because I already explained it earlier. I know why they got harder but I still hate. Then there is this elective I took, an easy one. Part of the grade was participation in discussions... I made sure to say 2-3 things a discussion so I can get credit for it. I ended up getting marked down on it and seriously why.

I'm looking for advice from anyone who has gone through this, particularly writing the appeal letter. 

The main reason I have is pretty much that I'm registered with the university's SDRC for a learning disability. Usually I have final exam accomodations but they were cancelled due to school closure from the outbreak. I want to mention this in the letter, but the way the school handles disability accomodations is that it's the student's responsibility to work with professors about this and might not be a valid reason. They also can't exempt requirements for disabilities.

625,Really Bummed Out. Need some advice to face this reality.,1,2020-03-22 20:53:23,10,"So it‚Äôs my final year here at UCR. My last quarter will be either in this summer or this coming fall. I am really bummed out because I made zero connections and friends or went to any events here on campus. So, long story short, I am a commuter and I‚Äôve been commuting here all 4 years so my social life here is already a bit limited. But with that being said, for my first two years of college, I had a large pool of friends from high school to hang out with back in my home town (which is near by campus) And those two years were some of the best I ever had because I finally got out of my shell more and just put myself out there in the world. I felt like I was connecting with more people and especially old friends . Thing is, while we all ‚Äúknew‚Äù each other, we were not exactly all that close knit. I realized that having a shared high school experience was the cohesive that mainly glued us all together (and a few other small things). we all had fun, but it was obvious to me that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to truly connect with this group as time went on because we were all slowly finding ourselves and in doing that, we became more differentiated from one another. Although I had a great group of friends, I couldnt deny that there was this unmet need still running in the background, this yearning to make true connections with people who I could relate to on a much more deeper level other than just a past shared school experience and a couple abstract interests. I wanted to eventually find and connect with truly kindred souls, especially around campus. 

Well, I stayed in that bubble for two years and had loads of fun, but as I alluded to above, our interests were widely different and starting to change. I was also changing and they were as well. I knew that this group served more as a hub for all of us to explore ourselves and what we truly vibe with and what we don‚Äôt,  so I knew that we‚Äôd all fade away from each other eventually. Evidently, what I foresaw came to fruition as my second year was coming to a close, everyone was finding another group they vibed with more, so I had plans to do the same and finally put myself out there and make new connections with people that I could vibe deeper with - all on my own when summer would arrive. 

But when that summer came by, a whole plethora of messes and mishaps happened. To much to name and sort out. It was just a huge mess. And like a domino effect, everything came crashing down.  It was sort of like a bunch of unfortunate things from over the years were stacking up on top of each other and then a couple of events happened that triggered a whole explosion. Looking back now, it was bound to happen. I couldn‚Äôt run away from my life long issues concerning family and other personal issues. So I had a, what I can see now as a long overdue nervous, emotional and mental break down. so massive that I thought it was all over for me. Didn‚Äôt know I was hanging by such a thin thread. 

So I had to quit school for a year and my first job that I had at the time . I also couldn‚Äôt really interact with anyone else other than my family because the issues were so severe. 2 and a half years later, I am still managing the aftermath and effects of my break down and just my life in general. And things have never been the same. Now I feel like a shell of my best self. A hollow. 

Haha I peaked during those two years in college. Had great physical health, confidence, great social life, grades were awesome, work was fun (for the most part). I had this burning passion for life that I never knew I had in me. Life was actually great for once and I was excited to continue that streak and make it even more better, but then everything collapsed and I feel like I just went back to ground zero. I have been working a lot on myself and learning so much and reflecting. I know almost everything about myself and my timeline and why everything happened the way that it did. Nothing is really hidden from me anymore. I can even say that I found my heart and soul in all the mud. 

During my time away (2.5 years), I lost connection with everyone I knew. We are all completely different people now. They moved on with their lives  while I was ‚Äòaway‚Äô and I too have changed and the reality here is that I can‚Äôt know them again. It‚Äôs all gone. 

What truly distresses me the most is that my time here is almost coming to a close and I know now that I won‚Äôt be able to do the things I wanted to because it‚Äôs almost over. Times have gotten a bit rough again and I can barely pass my classes because of the continuing negative after effects on my health due to the breakdown. 

For now I am focused on getting my degree as I am in no position to do anything else like making new friends or do anything other than just take it easy, focusing on my health and  just trying my best to finish school. So the reality here is that I won‚Äôt be making new connections here, no joining any clubs or organizations or networking with professors. I won‚Äôt be able to live on campus my final year like I planned.  I won‚Äôt be having the college experience I wanted to except for just going to class and struggling to finish on time. 

Once I finish, my opportunity to connect with others here is over. This place is like the most opportune place (and time) to build everlasting connections and memories and it‚Äôs fading away like a clump of sand falling from ones palm. 

I was expecting to finish college with a boom, but it‚Äôs definitely going to turn out to be a silence, a vacuum, a void - not even a whimper. I feel like all I‚Äôm getting is just a piece of paper with a name on it and , well, yes, new stuff learned...but still...just didn‚Äôt expect any of this to happen. 

Anyone got any advice to how to deal with this reality? Maybe going to grad school in the future can make up for this lost experience and could give me another chance, or maybe the best thing I should do for myself is give up extorting my sense of happiness and fulfillment to events and experiences.

Hi Highlanders,  


Oh hi, I'm Mark. You might've had me as your TA. I'm teaching a fun class on music in video games and movies (MCS006|MUS007) for summer session one and two. We look all sorts of movies from Tarantino to Studio Ghibli and games for the music games like for the Wii, maybe some musical arcade games, and huge open world games like Minecraft and RDR 2 and GTAV. The course requirements are pretty low-key, especially given our new normal. If our class is online, it'll more than likely asynchronous in a kind of podcast (maybe vlog) style with perhaps a Twitch stream lecture. It'll be a fun time. Feel free to message me if you have any questions.  


Be well,

697,A little personal good news in such ugly times,1,2020-03-25 00:22:12,20,"Hi everyone. First I want to preface that I hope you are all staying safe and practicing social distancing appropriately. I also want to congratulate any seniors who are struggling with a possible graduation cancellation, as well as congratulate everyone for pushing through finals despite all the academic and personal chaos.  
With that being said, I‚Äôd like to share a little bit how things have been going for me in 2020 so far.
I started the year off horribly. My grandma whom I loved so dearly passed away after her 3rd battle with cancer. She was VERY big on education and always encouraged us grandkids to get one and cheered us one for every little accomplishment. 
I had missed the first week of school already because I had gotten the flu, then missed week 2 and 3 partially to go back home and mourn. 
After that, I quit my job because I was miserable after 6 months of bad management and scheduling. I felt better after quitting but...I was broke again.
Despite all of that, I swore at my grandma‚Äôs
memorial in front of everyone that I would continue school and get the best grades in honor of her. 
Well I checked my final grades through my student profile on RWEB.
For the first time since I‚Äôve been in college, I‚Äôve gotten my best grades yet. Straight A‚Äôs. Freshman year I had fucked up and been on academic probation Winter 2017. And ever since I busted my ass to rake up my GPA and better grades and I‚Äôve finally done it. It may not be a big deal to anyone else‚Äîespecially if you always get high marks‚Äîbut it means a lot to me. I hope I made my grandma proud. 
If any of you struggled too but have made any accomplishments this quarter, please let me know &amp; celebrate with me. It might help all this damn crying I‚Äôm doing lol.

But then they sent another email saying that anyone who cancels their contract for Spring won‚Äôt have to pay any cancellation fee. So im assuming the deadline for March 27 doesn‚Äôt apply? In the new email they touch base on students who have renewed their contract, and how they can leave their personal belongings until then? But see here are my questions, Im hoping maybe some of you might know the answers:

1. I want to cancel my contract and won‚Äôt be returning at all. If i cancel by 27th of March, could I remove my belongings after a week or two? I don‚Äôt drive and my parents work full time so it would be impossible to have everything packed and ready to go by the 30th. 

2. If I cancel but want to stay until Mid-April would I only be charged rent up until then or for the whole month of april? 

3. Do we get charged rent up until the day we turn keys in??

I can't decide what school to go to (honestly I only envisioned myself going to a UC with predominantly Asians but I got rejected or waitlisted from all the ones I applied to).

SCU is #2 in CA for business, #33 in the US, but expensive even with financial aid. However, my parents said they would be willing to pull together some cash if I really wanted to attend. Is it worth the investment?

SLO is #55ish in the US for business and just a really good school overall but I don't know if I'll be able to enjoy the environment there. I didn't get to tour the schools beforehand because I thought I was going to a UC, and now everything is closed because of the quarantine. I'm from the Bay Area so I don't know how I'll fit in at a school where it's not predominantly Asians. It's also a lot cheaper.

UCR is in the top 100 in the US for Business (and honestly, if you're not going to a T20 Business School, the rankings don't really matter right...?) and it does have significantly more Asians. The price range is between SCU and SLO and it's in LA so I would want to go there. Except...I accidentally majored in Business Economics and have requested a major change to Pre-Business.

862,"After being admitted, my planned visit to UCR has now been cancelled. Could any of you take some time to answer some questions about UCR?",2,2020-03-29 17:18:51,18,"Hey Highlanders, 

I was admitted to UCR about three days ago. Anticipating that I might get in, I planned on visiting Riverside and a few other SoCal schools to tour the campuses before making a decision (I'm leaning towards UCR over some CSU's and small private schools) but with the advent of COVID-19, it's looking like a horrible time to take a 6 hour drive to see a now-empty campus.

That being said, I'm hoping that some of you can answer some questions that I would usually be able to ask a tour guide. I've been trying to read through the subreddit, other online forums, and UCR's website to get a good sense of the school, but nothing beats visiting the school, and then asking people connected to the school directly. I encourage any of you to write as much or little as you want, I'm just thankful and hopeful that some of you will be able to answer at all. There's a bunch of questions, so by all means, you don't have to answer any more than you want. Additionally, I am very cool with taking any unsolicited advice that isn't in a question below. Thank you.

~~Edit: I'm working on fixing the formatting so that the questions appear in bullet points.~~

**Dorm Life**

* What's it really like living in a dorm? Do you/did you live in a single, double, or triple? How difficult is it to get a single room? Is it worth it? 

* What's a good way to get to know your roommate and talk about all of the issues that come up with living with someone? Should I ask them a list of questions or is that kinda weird? It's probably good to over-communicate than under-communicate probably.

* What are good ways to settle or mediate conflicts with roommates? The RA is an obvious choice, but in the event that they're not available, what's a good alternative way?

* Is there any good way to invite someone over to your dorm overnight or is that pretty much always a bad idea?

* Does anyone actually have time for video games, and would bringing an old PS3 be a good idea? (I'm a fan of some older games, and I'm not too interested in PC gaming outside of Minecraft, really?) 

**Food and Dining**

* The meal plan is only good at residential restaurants and not campus restaurants, right? Or is there something else I'm missing?

* Is the Highlander Unlimited a good idea for someone who won't visit home except for probably Thanksgiving and Christmas? I have a pretty high metabolism and I don't gain weight easily, so I like to eat as much as I can.

* Could someone explain dining dollars, meal swipes, and guest passes?

* Can you get snacks throughout the day (with either Meal Plan) and eat them throughout the campus?

**What to Bring?**

* There are tons of packing lists for college online, but is there anything in particular that you think would be essential that isn't usually explicitly mentioned? Anything in particular for UCR (like stuff that's useful in events and such?)

* I'm an Eagle Scout and I guess bringing a first-aid kit, multi-tool is a good idea, are there any other prep things that are a good idea?

* How does laundry work in the dorms, and is it a good idea to bring as much clothes as possible so I don't have to pay for laundry as much?

**Being on Campus**

* How long does it take to walk from one corner of the campus to the other? Do people usually ride bikes on campus to and from classes if their classes are pretty far away? Even if biking on campus to classes is pretty stupid, is it a good idea to bring a bike to campus anyway?

* What are your favorite areas to study on campus? Is there a particularly good spot in the library or outside?

* What are some pretty cool unique things on campus? 

* I have a lot of hobbies and I'm really interested in photography, puzzles, trivia, geography, astronomy, getting outdoors and such. Are there pretty much clubs and groups for a few of those things?

* I'm not super interested in being at parties all the time at all, but how is the party scene at UCR?

**Academics**

* Is getting a minor that doesn't share too many classes with your major a good idea?

* Are there any successful studying methods that are relatively simple?

* Are there any good organization systems that have really worked for you?

* Does anyone have experiences in Theatre, Film, and Digital Production? (That's the major I was admitted for.)

* Does anyone have experiences in a minor in English or History? (Those are the two minors I'm considering.)

* Do you take notes with your laptop during class?

* How long are classes usually? For ones that are considerably long, do people ever bring food?

There's a ton more questions I have, but I won't ask them unless this post gets a lot of replies or becomes relevant for other admitted students, in which case, I'll probably turn this whole thing into a Google Docs file as a resource Q and A for the subreddit in general.

I have an overall gpa of 2.9 and I cannot seem to stop worrying about it, I have anxiety and I worry about my future every single day now. With my low GPA, it just feels like im letting my parents down and like im throwing their money into a trash can. Throughout my time at UCR, I have never been able to get higher than a B in any of my science classes (I get mostly Cs and Bs) and I told myself that I would work harder and improve my grades this year to boost my gpa but I am still unable to and at this point I have completely given up on my goal of going to pharmacy school based on how low my gpa is. It just feels like I'm putting so much of my time and effort into my classes but I am still not getting the grades that I want, which makes me frustrated and hopeless. I also have social anxiety so I don't have any extracurriculars and volunteer experience. I thought about switching majors this year since I found out that I really enjoyed learning ECON/business but I decided not to cause I didn't want to waste anymore time and money at UCR. I made a big mistake of choosing a major that was not right for me. I am also tired of learning/studying and just want to find a job that requires a biology degree after I graduate.

I want to repay my parents back one day so as of now, I am considering nursing or PA school but I am not sure if I can get in with my low gpa. I am also considering to find a job right after I graduate but don't know any jobs that require a biology degree.

1056,Incoming freshman with questions!,1,2020-04-01 11:15:22,2,"Hello there, I'm a probably incoming freshman guy admitted for CS. I would love to get answers to these questions I have.

**Dorms and life:**

1. I'm currently waiting to see if I get off the UCSD waitlist, so I am not planning on turning in my SIR until the week before it's due. How much of a disadvantage will this put me at in terms of getting the dorm I want and choosing roommates? Should I just turn in my SIR now?
2. Lothian, Pentland, Dundee? Pros/cons and anecdotal experiences would be great!
3. Any information about Dundee and how it compares to the others? I didn't find a whole lot about it.
4. What is the food situation like? Good/bad?
5. Will I have less space per person in a triple compared to a double? If not, how should I decide between a double and a triple?
6. How are the pianos in the practice rooms at the dorms? Does Dundee have those? Also, is it possible to get access to grand pianos without taking music courses?
7. I am bringing my Windows laptop, should I bring my PC? Also, is it worth getting a new laptop? I'm guessing no. For my later years, though, will I need to upgrade/switch platforms? Current specs: 15.6"" screen, Intel i7-8550u, Nvidia 1050, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD
8. What things should I bring with me to UCR that isn't immediately obvious?
9. How do I put myself ""out there""? I'm not a party animal, but I also don't want to have zero social life.
10. Is it recommended to get a bike/skateboard to get around campus, or is walking sufficient?
11. How's the weather like? How hot/cold is it, and at what times throughout the year?
12. Realistically speaking, how many clubs should I join?
13. What are some fun things to do at UCR?
14. What are some do's/don'ts?
15. Any other general advice or useful knowledge about UCR?

**Academics + CS Major-related:**

   16.  Advice that you wish you could tell your past self?

   17.  Is it worth getting an iPad to take notes on?

   18.  How should I prepare for CS courses before attending? I have some programming experience and am taking AP CS A at my high school.

   19.  What are some commonly used programs that I should be familiar with?

   20.  What are CS assignments like?

   21.  How is the ACM club? Is it worth paying to become a registered member? What is ACM-W?

   22.  Is [this](https://student.engr.ucr.edu/sites/g/files/rcwecm1536/files/2019-10/2019_encs.pdf) a good course plan?

**Other:**

My name is Jeffrey Tran and I‚Äôm running to be your next VP of Internal Affairs.¬† 

Currently, I am serving as the Finance Outreach Coordinator. This past year, I have helped pass budgets and grants for student organizations. In addition, while serving on the GCAP committee, I have ensured sustainability remains a top priority on our campus.

I am writing today to ask for your thoughts. I want to listen from students as much as possible. Please share with me your concerns and ideas to how ASUCR can better serve you.

1305,"Wanted to major in Psych, but got accepted for Human Development instead?",1,2020-04-08 20:55:03,12,"Can someone please enlighten me on this situation: 

I wanted to major in Psych so that I could become (later on oc) a high school psych teacher but if I attend UCR majoring in Human Development, I searched around on the internet and apparently for education it's basically becoming a PreSchool teacher, is that correct? But I don't want to become a preschool teacher because I don't want to have to change the little kids' diapers &gt;.&lt; 

(also, I can become a high school psych teacher straight off the bat with a bachelor's degree in psych, is that correct? )

What kinds of careers can I get with a human development major? Would going to Merced instead (since they accepted me with Psych) be the better option because psych can open up more career paths and also I can't become a high school teacher/middle school teacher with a human development major? 

(Forgive me if I sound super dumb in this post btw) 

Also for those who are majoring/have majored in human development, how is it? Do you like it? Is it fun? Boring? Do you feel like you get a lot out of it? Also, why did you choose that major and what types of careers are you considering after college? 

I've heard that human development is one of the easiest majors, is that correct? Are the classes really that easy? I heard they are very group oriented 

TL;DR : Should I attend UCR (even though they didn't accept me for the major I originally wanted) or attend UCM? Also, what is it like majoring in human development",0.10231182795698926,0.4248387096774194,riverside

Obviously, a more thought out scale would be better, but this is just a quick suggestion as pass/fail classes don't contribute to the betterment of students' gpa's. Personally I was depending on this quarter to continue raising my GPA for grad school apps, but with everything going on it may seem a bit more difficult to receive A's.

I have a professor who has only given one lecture since the beginning of the quarter. Its a really hard subject for me already and I am already having problems understanding wtf is going on. 

I have tried to email them multiple times on clarification about a certain assignment but there has been no response. A few of my classmates as well as the TAs have also mailed them but again, no response since last week. We are all just left so confused and not knowing what to do. 

This is the last course I need (and many others in my class) before graduating but I have such a bad feeling that I‚Äôm going to fail this since we are already off to an awkward start. 

Would it be awful to just drop the class if this continues and try again in the fall? Should we keep trying to contact them? Is there someone else we should contact about this? I hope they are okay since 10+ of us have sent mails but at the same time, I feel like it‚Äôs not very professional to completely ignore an entire class.

Need advice, guidance, support",8,2020-04-15 04:10:45,8,"This is some late night posting so I might delete this when I wake up. This is an update to what I posted previously about my struggles with financial aid to process my FAFSA and recognize me as an independent.

They‚Äôre pushing that they want proof that I grew up without my parents. I gave them documents from 2007 where they signed, with their SSN and their full legal names, stating they‚Äôre handing me over to my grandmother. It came with official stamps and everything but because it isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúlegal appointed‚Äù document that I must provide information about my parents and their income when I haven‚Äôt been in contact with them since 2007. This is devastating because I don‚Äôt think I have these documents they want. This whole situation has been such a family/community embarrassment that idk if they went through the legal process to officially hand me over before they abandoned me. I mean, I was believing that my parents would come for me until I was in middle school. Idk what to do. This is freaking me out that my parents didn‚Äôt even give me the legal ability to separate myself from them. 

I wouldn‚Äôt be bothering financial aid if I wasn‚Äôt in this situation. I don‚Äôt want to admit it but this whole thing makes me want to kill myself. It‚Äôs so humiliating to have to go through files after files of my past to dig up the literal evidence that I‚Äôm a freak of nature for Financial Aid to essentially say it‚Äôs not good enough and they don‚Äôt believe me. It‚Äôs humiliating to be a kid that no one wanted and I tried so hard, SO HARD my whole life to be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. I don‚Äôt have a normal guardianship. I dont have normal parents. I struggled by myself in school, trying to keep up with my peers. I struggled to learn the whole college system by myself. Now I‚Äôm struggling alone against this big entity that I thought was suppose to help me. I did all this shit to be a normal kid for nothing because at the end of the day, I‚Äôm damaged goods and I wasn‚Äôt dealt the same cards as others. I can‚Äôt go to college if my fafsa isn‚Äôt passed. I live off of fafsa money to pay for rent and food, idk what I‚Äôll do with my life if this doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôm a good kid and I got grants and a fellowship but it doesn‚Äôt cover for shit. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the point anymore. I‚Äôm tired. They‚Äôve tired me out. This back and forth and this humiliating process is tiring me out. They win. I‚Äôve been chasing the chance to be free from my parents and it‚Äôs not working. I worked so hard in academia to be free from my past for what? What‚Äôs the fucking point. And in 6 hours I have to pretend like this isn‚Äôt happening to me and attend some stupid little class and do some stupid little discussion assignment. Every time I‚Äôve tried to indirectly reach out for help to a professor, it hasn‚Äôt worked out or I‚Äôve been ignored. Idk what to do anymore. I don‚Äôt want to call financial aid bc I don‚Äôt want to cry. I spend every literal day crying and numbing myself and crying again. Idk what to do. I‚Äôll probably panic delete this when I remember about this tomorrow. Idk where else to turn but here as my last ditch cry for help before idk.

Just got accepted and all (SOC major) for Fall 2020, and gunning for the BA option. However, I've already completed Eng 1A and 1C at a CC, but the [requirements](https://sociology.ucr.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/15F_BA_SOC.pdf) says 1 full year (not sure how the quarter system works yet). Does this mean I will need to complete 1B at UCR when I transfer?

I also took 2 semesters (fall/spring) of French, so will I need to take another course or two?

Also, my EFC is crap (0) and this is what I was [awarded](https://imgur.com/a/zMIbV9J). What will I be looking at costs for full-time out of pocket? I've been accepted at other schools in the CSU system, but none are matching or granting anything more other than loans and a small state grant, so I am really pushing for UCR since they are helping a bit more?

First of all, when do room selection time slots usually start rolling out? I wanna get a triple room but they're supposedly ""limited"" so I don't want to miss the bus on that one, but I'm also getting tired of checking everyday.

Next, does anyone have any insight on the BS+MS program? I'm going into Bioengineering BS+MS and so if anyone could share a bit about the program, that'd be very nice.

Also, does anyone know the double major policy for CNAS? I want to major in math as well, but I can only find the double major policy if I want to double major at BCOE.

Another thing that's really important, does anyone know what kind of credit is offered from AP Bio, Chem, and World History? It says ""Natural Sciences A"", ""Natural Sciences B"", and ""Humanities A"" respectively, but uh... do I get to pick? What does it mean? Do the letters indicate quarter or a division in that field or what? I got a 4 in Bio and World, and a 3 in Chem, and I'm trying to make a course plan for myself and I don't know what I can drop off my major requirements (there's a lot of goddamn Chem in the requirements and I just want to limit how much Chem I'll be forced to take). Like, BIOL 005A, 005LA, and 005B are required, but they're topics that I've alreadt covered in AP Bio. If anyone has gotten these AP credits and could tell me what they covered, that would be really great!

And finally, just some generic things, like how's the campus? How are the professors? Which meal plan should I go with 'cuz the more expensive one almost seems worse? How's the roommate selecting process? How are the rooms? Just standard garbage questions like that.

I think that's all I've got, if I have any more questions then I might post them here if people actually look at this. If anyone can answer any of these questions, even just one ('cuz I just dropped a lot, I can't imagine someone would have all the answers to these.

The video should be helpful for many incoming first years.

At UCSC I‚Äôll be able to pick pretty much any dorm and the 7 day meal plan while at UCR I‚Äôll have to pick the triple and the cheapest meal plan to keep my price low.

2. Does UCR have a lot of things to do outside of campus? (Movie Theaters, fastfood restaurant‚Äôs, attractions, etc)

This quarter, I'm taking HIST15 along with 3 upper div CS courses. Because my other 3 upper divs are overwhelming me rn, and I can't really get anything done at home with my family, I'm considering dropping it if I don't manage to do well on our first essay assignment and taking some other History class over the summer. I can't afford to drop one of the upper divs because I cannot take them over the summer as they are not offered, so I would have to wait until Fall to take it. I've debated making it pass/no pass, but I realized that it might not be worth it if I get like a C- or something, which is considered ""no pass.""

Hypothetically, if I do drop HIST15, I'm gonna be going from 16 units -&gt; 12 units. How will this affect my Financial Aid?

Taking online classes and keeping up with brutal assignments is starting to overwhelm me. I'm at the extent where I question how I'll be able to work my way through college or if my any of my work is college worthy. This quarter has been a MESS since it started for me. Working from home is difficult when I have to avoid my stressors (accumulating family drama, sibling issues, bills, utilities, rising mortality news from COVID-19). Then, there's a lovely pile of escalating assignments waiting for me to do. I tried. I always try to give my very best into completing my assignments yet this quarter has been difficult for me to do well. My TA is a tough grader and despite the many times I try, I always end up with shit grades. I don't know how I'll be surviving this quarter without losing my sanity and giving in to my overdue depression that I've been ignoring. Everything is not okay. I don't feel okay.

I‚Äôve been giving it my all and I wake up at 8am and finish my readings/ assignments / and lectures / at around 4-5pm Monday -Friday. I have a class that‚Äôs not a major requirement but it is an elective. The professor expects us to write papers every single week. Do more than 40+ pages worth of readings and we have a quiz every week and we have 2 research assignments and another 1.5k reflection paper. I registered for the class because on rate my professor there were excellent reviews saying how the class was simple, straight to the point, and do-able. 

I‚Äôm putting in so much work only to have a low B in the class. My grades are just getting worse no matter how much time I spend or study habits I change it‚Äôs just not helping. Therefore I want to no pass/pass this class if I end up getting lower than a C. I want to go to grad school for counseling and the class isn‚Äôt a requirement to get in.

I can‚Äôt move out because Im not financially stable and my anxiety has gotten so bad that keeping a job recently has been difficult. I would spend my entire day at school from 7am-8 pm almost everyday just to avoid being around my family. Being at home, no matter how many times I tell my family I‚Äôm busy in lecture or to please keep it down they don‚Äôt care. They scream and yell and act as loud as they can. For example ... few moments ago. My computer kept disconnecting from the internet and disrupting my zoom lectures. It was because my sister was playing fortnite. I go out to the living room and ask if she can please not play right now because  I‚Äôm in lecture and need the internet. She begins to scream and say 30 more minutes please ! And I say I‚Äôm sorry but I need you to put the controller down right now. She ignores me and continues to play so I have no choice but to turn the system off. She throws the controller at me and runs to my mothers room and slams the door. My mother takes her side and I‚Äôm the bad guy because I never helped ‚Äúeducate‚Äù her. My mother is mainly a stay at home mother and I do my best to stay outside of my home as long as I can because being here deteriorates me. So it‚Äôs my fault in her eyes, in her culture older siblings are expected to take a parenting role. I did that during high school, but once in college. I just don‚Äôt have the time or flexibly or WANT, to even be home where I‚Äôm a scape goat. 

I‚Äôm trying so hard to do well but every week I‚Äôm just seeing my grades slip more and more and more. Doesn‚Äôt matter if I do all the readings, annotate, write notes, pay attention, talk to TA‚Äôs. Nothing is helping me do as good as I normally do.

I got into UCSD for electrical engineering and UCR for cs. Both majors interest me so that‚Äôs not a problem. UCR would be free for me + priority registration. UCSD would be roughly 10k/ year in loans. I‚Äôm interested in going to grad school after and have dreams of going to a top grad school. Both are close to home but I‚Äôd dorm at UCSD and at UCR I‚Äôd commute. I‚Äôm stumped....any input would be greatly appreciated.

Pros of UCSD:

-higher ranking/more prestige
-more/better opportunities?
-more of a college experience because of dorming

Cons:

-would have to take loans
-no priority registration
-possibly harder to stand out for grad school?


Pros of UCR:

-free
-priority registration
-possibly could double major or graduate in 3 years

Cons:

-less opportunities?
-don‚Äôt get to experience a new environment

==================================================================================

***For the people who just say that we can ""change"" our grading basis to P/NP by asking our advisor***

(Copied and pasted from previous reply)

""If you took the time to read the petition itself, there are important aspects of the grading basis that I am writing about. It isn't just about changing a class to P/NP. I am aware that we have an option to switch to P/NP for our classes. However, the policy that UCR has for changing P/NP has been minimal to none in comparison to other universities.

For example, the deadline for changing P/NP for Spring 2020 is the same deadline that it would be for other quarters (REGARDLESS of COVID-19) for changing a course from a letter grading basis TO a P/NP grading basis. The only significant changes that UCR has made for COVID-19 is the following:

1. ""**In spring 2020, students can withdraw from one or more classes without a 'W' grade through the end of week eight of instruction without an associate dean‚Äôs approval.**¬† Starting in week nine, all requests for single course withdrawals will need an associate dean‚Äôs approval.""
2. **In spring 2020, courses taken and graded Satisfactory (S) will not count toward the maximum, one-third limit of total UC units permitted for any undergraduate degree**.¬†

So technically, we are allowed to P/NP our courses for Spring 2020 and it would not affect our 1/3 limit. However, this policy cannot be implemented for all of the students equally. For example, many of us are unable to take the option of P/NP because their entire course load for the quarter is composed of MAJOR related courses. Because of the minimal changes in the grading policy pushed forth by UCR, not many students can utilize this P/NP to help alleviate the stress that comes with online courses (technology failures, the poor transition of professors/TAs from converting the course that is suitable for an online platform, etc).

If you look at many universities across the nation and even within the UC system itself, many schools have decided to implement some form of either mandatory or optional P/NP grading policy where P credit will be allowed to satisfy both major, minor, and general requirements.

Nowhere on UCR's website or in any of the e-mails that they have sent have policies or amendments that mirror these types of policies that are implemented by other universities.

Heck, even if you look at the P/NP deadline, other universities have chosen to push the deadline back due to the COVID-19 situation and to better accommodate students. For example, UCLA has given the option for their students to change their grading basis to P/NP by the END of Week 10.

2016,UCR Grading Policy Change,1,2020-05-02 17:32:25,30,"Hi everyone. I hope everybody is doing as relatively well as possible, given the current abysmal state of things. I'm not sure how many people have seen this, but there are a number of schools popping up in the news for changing the way they grade students. Yale, Harvard, Columbia, and Dartmouth have all adopted some form of mandatory or opt-in pass/no-pass grading scales^(1). Even better, Pitzer College in Claremont has adopted a policy with the following guidelines:

"" Students who finish with a D- or higher in their courses will receive a ‚ÄúSatisfactory Pandemic‚Äù grade on their transcript and a 4.0 in the class, according to an email from Faculty Executive Committee chair Paul Faulstich. Those who finish with a grade lower than a D- will have the course stricken from their transcript, as if they had dropped the class before the drop deadline.""^(2)

Given the severity of this pandemic, along with a myriad of other reasons such as nearly 50% of UCR undergraduates being considered low income^(3), a group of students are working to push for a grading policy adjustment here. Their instagram can be found [ucr4gradingchange](https://www.instagram.com/ucr4gradingchange/). They are currently pushing a Google form survey asking what we would like to see implemented here at UCR. The form can be found below:

[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdVKuKMxMaMmMGeJ9H1gvnHWIH9dDXggu80xQqLaoMTdZBivQ/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdVKuKMxMaMmMGeJ9H1gvnHWIH9dDXggu80xQqLaoMTdZBivQ/viewform) 

If you have the time, please fill out and share this form with as many people as you can. Updates are being posted frequently on the Instagram as well. If you are interested in more ways to spread this survey and movement, feel free to PM me. Thank you, and stay safe. Take care of yourself when you can, and when you can't just know that's okay too.

2025,What happens if you are accused of cheating?,1,2020-05-03 14:00:42,21,"I have a class that requires a quiz to be submitted every Saturday. You can take the quiz a few days before its due. Once you finish the quiz it gives you a score but it doesn't allow you to see which questions you missed. After Saturday (the day it's due) the questions pop back up and you are able to see what questions you missed.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I had missed two questions on the quiz that I had taken on Friday, I thought it would be a good idea to discuss the answers with my GroupMe classmates on Sunday. (The quiz closes Saturday night and nobody else is allowed to take the quiz anymore). Hence, I believing that I was not doing anything wrong. This afternoon (Sunday), a student has accused me of cheating on the quiz and told me that the TA in the group me will probably report me for academic misconduct. 

It really was not my intention to cheat or to share information, I just wanted to discuss the answers because I was confused as to what I had gotten wrong on the quiz... but now multiple students are accusing me of cheating. Even though the quiz was due Saturday, and I had already taken the quiz on Friday. There was no way I could cheat since the quiz was closed and the questions were up on ilearn? It's my second quarter at ucr and  Im just doing my best. And i would never cheat, and If my intention were to cheat? then why would I do it in a groupme where the TA is part of the chat? Or why would I try to cheat on a Sunday? after the quiz was due. I am sorry, I already have generalized anxiety and these allegations are sending me to a very bad place mentally, I am trying hard to be positive about my situation but I am shitting bricks quite honestly. I emailed my TA and explained my intentions to her and I am waiting for her reply, but I am freaking out. I have never cheated and I would never do that.

So pretty much i'm really struggling this quarter with online learning. I'm currently in an upper div class offered only spring quarter, and originally took it this spring so I can finish my degree 2 quarters early, but at this point I think i've decided to stay my full 4th year so I can just take the class Spring of 2021.

I see on the withdrawal page of the Office of the Registrar that for Spring 2020 you can withdrawal before week 8 and not get a ""W"" on your transcript. My question is that in the financial aid withdrawal guide, it says that ""Withdrawing may affect your eligibility to receive financial aid in subsequent terms"". Does this only apply if you have a ""W"" on your transcript or will my financial aid be permanently impacted from withdrawing?

Also, does anyone know how long the financial aid office takes to respond, the phone lines are closed until June 18 and they have yet to reply to my email.

2076,Question regarding Calfresh benefits and moving,1,2020-05-05 00:49:49,1,"So I know that part of receiving benefits means that you have to have to report any changes as far as income, address, household size, etc. My recertification period was in March and I had submitted the documents that they asked from me. Apparently I didn‚Äôt supply a certain document that was needed so I was told that my benefits would be cut because of that unless I sent in that document. Then shortly afterwards was when I got the notice that campus was going to be closed. I decided that I had to move out of my apt (i lived in the campus apartments) to save money and now I am back at my parents house. Honestly the food stamps were the last thing on my mind with the craziness going on so I just assumed I stopped getting them and that my case was closed. But I checked today and I guess they weren‚Äôt canceled because I received my allotment for this month which is already a month past the deadline they gave me. Not sure if this is Covid-19 related? 

Anyways, my question is, should I report my change of address? I‚Äôm living in my parents spare room atm in LA and although I am not paying full rent or on a lease with them I am buying my own groceries, paying for some utilities, and giving them some ‚Äúrent‚Äù (like $100-$200 here and there). I know that I am required to report changes but from what i have read it seems like the most important one is the change in income which has not changed for me so far. I do plan to eventually move out again. Should I just wait for the next recertification period? I just don‚Äôt want to get in trouble and these food stamps are actually a big help to me. I would contact my case worker but she is very unhelpful and hard to reach, when she does answer her phone she always gives me attitude when I have questions :/",0.09469246031746033,0.5049437830687831,riverside

2079,To Whom it May Concern:,10,2020-05-05 11:03:22,13,"To whom it may concern,
I know that this message may sound cliche, but I think you all should hear this. Over the past few months, things seem like they continue to get worse and worse, and school seems to get harder and harder. However, it is essential that no matter where you're at, whether it be at home, dorms, a friend, or a family member's house, you keep your head up. Many Americans are dealing with a strong feeling of depression and isolation at the moment. These feelings may lead many of us to feel like we're in an endless hole of counterproductivity and uselessness. But, the reality is that no matter how bad we think of the fact that we can't do much, this whole thing is out of our control. So, you should stop beating on yourself for feeling a certain way.

Instead, let out your emotions! Whether you need to cry, go for a walk, take a relaxing shower, or whatever it is that you need‚Äîdo it! Also, I know it may sound like bad advice, but in times like this, you must put your mental, physical, and emotional health first and understand that nothing comes before that. If you absolutely cannot deal with a class or a particular assignment, just put it aside and take care of yourself. If you have to email your professor, academic advisor, or TA and tell them your current situation, I can guarantee you that as much as you dislike the current mood, we are all in, so do your instructors. Like I said before, we are all in this together.

Recently, I bombed a midterm and felt very sad about it for a couple of days. I also felt very unmotivated and unwilling to open my computer and continue working on other assignments. But after some serious contemplation, I realized that a class is NOT worth me feeling down and depressed. Instead, I emailed my academic advisor and dropped the course, knowing that I made a decision that can better help me succeed this quarter. In turn, if I had decided to stay in the class, I would not have been okay‚Äîmentally nor physically. If you are dealing with a similar experience, understand that you can always retake the course or figure things out when the situation gets better. 

Also, If you are someone who is currently in a toxic household, know that my prayers are with you. You have EVERY reason not to feel okay, and if you have to do something to make yourself feel better, do it! There is no need for anyone but yourself to understand why you failed an exam, dropped a class, or even did poorly in a course as a whole. Because at the end of the day, only you'll be the one reaping the rewards of your decisions.

At the end of the day, we all have many years to catch up on whatever we lost during this time. At the end of the day, we all know that we will survive this pandemic. At the end of the day, we are all humans who require tranquility. So, remember, do what you have to do, and be selfish in making decisions for the benefit of your health!",0.015918650793650797,0.428420634920635,riverside

We were close friends who didn't talk often but had each other's backs. She even kept me in her life in times when she changed her number and deleted all social media.

However, ever since we moved in together, her behavior has been less than ideal. Rather than address her issues with me, she complains to our friends and makes me look like a bad person. Even our friends have agreed she's blown things out of proportion saying, ""that shit don't add up"" when they really see how I act. She complains about small things, like how I spend my money, or how I left dishes in the sink before heading out to campus, or how I left the pantry door open.  She became a toxic person and decided to call her out on everything December of fall quarter. Since then, I don't talk to her unless necessary. She never apologized because, ""of her pride"" (direct quote). 

She's not my friend anymore, and I think it's her issue if she doesn't speak up about things. I don't bother to ask her about my boyfriend staying over because after acting the way she did, she's lost my respect. Also, it's not like she acts like a reasonable roommate either. Last week, she had sex on my beanbag in the living room while I was still clearly awake and in the other room and then left her underwear behind the TV (that I own). (the day before that, she had sex in the restroom).  I confronted her about it, and I think that's what sent her past the tipping point because yesterday, she told me she requested to move out, and that I'll be contacted by housing soon to have a meeting to ensure there is no conflict. Has anyone gone through this before? What happens during the meeting? Is it likely she told them about her issues, or that she just wants to move out? If she tells them about my boyfriend staying over, can I get kicked out or will I just receive a warning?",-0.002083333333333328,0.39374999999999993,riverside
2089,This there any way I can fight this? Anyone I can talk to?,1,2020-05-05 17:45:34,3,"So I canceled my housing contract and moved out of Stonehaven on a Saturday morning. I still have roommates living there, one in each room. I wonder if I should clean some stuff but one of them assures me that I wont get charged till the end of the school year and that he would have the apartment clean by then. Keep in mind that the apartment is not even dirty, just cluttered. Now I'm being charged almost $300 for ""maintenance, cleaning, and damage charges.""  And there was nothing damaged when I left. 

I call central billing to ask about these ridiculous charges and they tell me that thats what was reported by the people at Stonehaven and that they would check to confirm if the charges are right. Two days later they tell me that they are. I call Stonehaven, they dont tell me what was cleaned, if anything was damaged, and that they didnt care that I still had roommates living there. They basically told me to f off. Instead of a $90 charge, which I get that, its now almost $400. 

This is ridiculous by itself but there's currently a crisis and I cant spend that much on an apartment that I dont live in anymore. Is there anything I can do?

It says on the page ""You may edit your application responses any time prior to receiving a housing offer by logging back into your application."" so I'm assuming it doesn't, but I'm still worried that that might be the reason why I haven't heard back from them yet.

Many of us are tired of the online format. We have come home to more than unfortunate home lives and situations. Many of us are trying our best with what we have. We didn't choose to come home as if this is a vacation, we were forced back home. I understand the concerns over the test scores being higher, however you told us that we were going to be given those 5 questions. Many of us relied on those 5 questions while we took the test! You never gave indication that those 5 questions could be taken away. That is why we are upset. You made a big promise, and backed out on it just because it didn't work for you. Having known that those 5 questions were important i'm sure many of us would have taken the test differently. You keep preaching that the class did just fine even without the 5 points, but you fail to mention the bottom half of the grades that got dug deeper into a hole because those 5 points were put back. As a professor, it would be your responsibility to let us know that these 5 questions aren't a guarantee that they would stay, that way we take caution when we test. However, you would rather call us ungrateful when it was YOU who made the faulty promise. I'm grateful for the extra time and open book you gave us. I also don't think anybody would have complained if you just told us the test is out of 175. You lead us on and after being called out on it, you rather call us the problem.

You will have to go onto the placement test website and register for a test. There‚Äôs a $30 fee that will be billed to your student account after you take it. The day of the test, you will be sent a Zoom link so you can be proctored. You will need to have your camera on during the test. The test itself will be available on iLearn. You will be temporarily added to a foreign language course so you can access the test. You‚Äôll only be able to access it on the actual website, not the Blackboard app, so be sure you have access to a computer.

2. The Actual Test
The exam is ALL written questions, there aren‚Äôt any multiple choice. I believe there were 10 questions, but I‚Äôm not too sure. All the questions are written in Vietnamese, so you need to know how to read Viet to take the exam at all. The majority of the questions were short and asked for open-ended free response answers. (Example: Describe your favorite Vietnamese dish.) If you know how to write in Viet, you might want to see if you can download a Vietnamese keyboard so your responses are stronger. There was one reading comprehension question, in which you had to translate a short passage into English. It is a timed exam, so make sure you finish as much as possible. If you finish before time is up, just submit and leave the Zoom call.

3. Placement
I personally have experience with speaking Vietnamese at home with family. I can also read somewhat; I was able to understand almost all of the questions and get the gist of the translation question. I‚Äôm not great at writing, and I also don‚Äôt have a Vietnamese keyboard, so my responses were 3-4 sentences and written without accent marks. I was able to view my placement the week after I took it and I got placed into VNM 002. For anyone else who‚Äôs taking the class for the requirement, you need to take all the VNM classes up to VNM 4.

I know it's not a matter I should be fussy about, but it sucks, when I can't use my computer for zoom, that I have connection problems on my phone. So i'm just wondering if the school downgraded their WIFI cause no one is really on campus?",0.05833333333333335,0.43194444444444446,riverside

2223,Seeking College Students for Documentary,10,2020-05-11 12:27:41,23,"  

Hello all!

I am making a documentary about how the **COVID-19 pandemic has been affecting college students** across the country and would love to hear from as many voices as possible. So, if you feel comfortable filming yourself speaking about the issue, please reach out!

Some of the stories I wish to highlight include:

\- Seniors, Freshmen, Grad students/PhD candidates

\- Folks in very hands-on majors that are virtually impossible to adapt to distance learning

\- Students who have had to drop classes/significantly change their academic paths

\- Students who were/are studying abroad

\- Students active in on-campus groups

\- Students who have attempted to/have gotten refunded for the semester

\- Students who are not eligible for stimulus packages/financial assistance

\- Students who have a hard time with online classes (can‚Äôt focus, poor wi-fi at home, time zones, etc‚Ä¶)

But I do not wish to limit my search to just the above! If you have a story to tell, I want to hear it. Please message me directly if you are interested in being a part of this project. All filming and producing will, at least for now, be done remotely.

Many thanks, and stay at home,

2239,Should I be worried? - Housing in Fall Quarter,1,2020-05-11 22:57:37,8,"Hello, it's me again.

I submitted my campus apartment application on January 25 for Falkirk and Stonehaven (I put in my application earlier like December...but my RA told me to cancel it because it was under the wrong year)  
I'm just concerned as I do plan on coming back to campus for the Fall...my home environment is not suitable for online classes AND I don't have my own bedroom/privacy. I basically sleep on a futon next to my desk in an open pathway ""room"". If I really do have to stay home, then my grandparents won't allow me to stay up because they are stingy with bills (which I understand), but I tend to stay up late doing my work, where sometimes I don't sleep at all. They also will complain that I'm always on my computer, and I really do not need that added stress during this time.  


So far, Housing hasn't gotten back to me for campus apartments, but I see most of my friends got theirs already. I don't really want to rent an apartment off campus, because I will be alone and I don't want to be binded to a contract that's not associated with the campus. So should I be concerned that housing hasn't gotten back to me? What's the latest for me to know that I didn't get Campus Housing so that I can just prepare myself to rent off campus(worst case scenario)? because I really do not want to stay home during Fall for reasons stated above.",0.04583333333333334,0.4194444444444445,riverside

2313,Unfair Grading from POSC007W?,1,2020-05-14 00:00:13,4,"I'm in Intro to Political Theory with Prof. Mannies right now. Its a pretty decent class, but I believe that one of our TA's I believe is being extremely unfair with his grading. Discussion is worth 15% of our grade for the class. Every week, all students have to do is use the discussion feature of iLearn to answer a set of weekly questions from reading and lectures. Pretty awesome right? No online lectures to watch or discussions to attend through zoom. Here was the description that our TA gave to us in the section's syllabus.

*""Discussion sections will be conducted via discussion boards on iLearn. I will post questions about the material Sunday night for each week. Students must answer one of these questions, or ask a question about the material, by midnight on Friday to count for attendance that week. If students answer multiple questions and/or engage with other students, I will record that as participation for that week.""*

Basically, it sounded like students had answer 2 questions, and post them on the discussion thread for attendance and participation credit. After posting discussion questions for Week 1, the TA even rewrote the assignment instructions. Here are these instructions.

*""Answering one will be counted as attendance. You must answer the question in your own words; do not copy/paste an answer from the internet. Answering more than one question, or commenting substantively on another student's answer, will be counted as participation.""*

For the past 7 weeks, students were answering two questions on the thread and posting them for credit. We were never once given explicit grades for our answers. The TA did not tell us if we were doing the assignment wrong, so everyone went on about their lives. Earlier this week, I emailed the TA about how the discussion was going to be graded, since there it was very unclear in the syllabus. This is what the TA replied to me. 

*""Attendance is the bare minimum needed to pass. So if a student answers just one question a week, they'll get a C or C+ (depending on the quality of the answer) for their discussion grade. If a student wants a B or an A, they'll need to participate more by answering more questions and/or engaging with other students' answers. If a student answers all the questions adequately and responds to a few students (or to me if I commented) substantively, they'll get an A+. A lot of students are just answering two questions a week. That'll only earn them a C+ or B-, depending on the quality of their answers. A student should be answering all the questions. Answering just two a week will result in at most a B-. I make an A+ difficult to get.""*

Many of the students in section have been receiving B minuses without knowing it, and the TA never once tried to correct us. I looked back at the weekly discussion threads and not one student in my section answered all the questions, because we didn't know that we had to answer all of them for credit. The way the TA phrased his instructions made it seem like answering 2 questions per week was sufficient. Now it looks like none of us will be getting an A in the discussion because of the TA's poor wording. The TA should have explicitly told us that we needed to answer all the questions to receive an A+. I'm certain that if he said that we had to answer all the questions for full credit, most of my classmates would be answering all of them. Is it fair for the TA to pull a fast one on us like this? Would it be a good idea to complain to somebody? Please let me know your guys' thoughts.

**TL;DR** TA being unfair by not explaining assignment instructions and secretly giving us all C pluses and B minuses. None of us knew we were doing the whole class wrong, so why should we be getting low grades?",0.13537414965986394,0.5498299319727891,riverside

Last Moments, End of Life

The skies are clouded

the surface of the water is cold

my heart grows heavy

my body sinks

the world is gray

the bottom is black

suspended in water

time has stopped

the world grows darker

the only light exists in my hands

removed from my chest, it dims away

the last of my strength fades, ok...

I close my eyes, I feel warm inside

my body¬¥s relaxed, I will be fine

I embrace the cold, I release my light

surrender my soul, I give up this fight 

end it all, this is goodbye 

farewell to all, I cease my life.

2390,EFC changed significantly. Wanting a financial aid prediction for next school year,1,2020-05-17 12:06:29,5,"Hey y‚Äôall. I attended UCR last year with an EFC of about $17,000. It was a good financial year for my family, but UCR cost about $13,000 as a result. After filing my FAFSA in October, my EFC is $4,500 because my mom lost her job. 

Could somebody with an EFC around $4,500 tell me how much their financial aid award was? That way, I can reasonably predict my award for next year. You don‚Äôt have to provide too much detail if that makes you uncomfortable, just a total amount will be fine. I‚Äôm Cal Grant A eligible and will receive a Pell Grant of $1,625.

2402,Professors I think you should take at least once at UCR,1,2020-05-17 22:43:19,50,"I'm a fourth year and graduating this June. I started to reflect on my classes and some of my favorite professors, and how I took them by a complete stroke of luck. I hadn't heard of them before, no one told me who to take or if they were good. So I wanted to make a post to students who will be  at UCR longer, so these professors enlighten you/make a subject much more enjoyable for you. 

1. **Michael Hawkins (History)**: Dr. Hawkins is a born story teller. I know a lot of people talk about Chrissanthos, I had both, but what Hawkins lacks in looks he makes up for in his lecturing format. I never missed because I actually enjoyed sitting down and hearing his lectures, I felt like a 5 year old. He also touches on a lot of aspects that are left out of American history (think racist and imperialist america)
2. **Emma Stapely (English)**: Dr. Stapely is an incredibly kind human being. She is never condescending or a know-it-all in how she explains texts (like MANY of the professors I've had), she is really great explaining difficult concepts in literature and is very straightforwards in what she asks from you. 
3. **David Nelson (Genetics)**: Derek Shepard's look alike, with the salt and pepper hair + sass + confidence. He's not naive and understands students well, so I never felt frustrated in the course regardless of the difficulty. Adds a bit of humor and keeps the class interesting, my most enjoyable biology course. 
4. **Stephanie Dingwall (Biochemistry)**: You have probably heard of Dr. Dingwall if you're in CNAS. She is very charismatic and explains mechanisms and concepts in a very simple manner, she breaks down why different things happen instead of assuming you know it and gives reasoning that helps you memorize certain names/steps for mechanisms. 
5. J**ack Eichler (Chemistry)**: Eichler! The whiskey loving handsome devil that crushed me with his final. He teaches chemistry simply, straight to the point and easy to understand, the only gen chem class that I knew what was going on. HOWEVER, while you may do well on his midterms, don't be relaxed because his final is brutal so you have to know your stuff. 
6. **Stephen Wimpenny (Physics):** The Santa Claus of Physics, his gift is his flawless teaching skills. But really, I did terrible in 2A and once I got to 2B with him I started loving the stuff. Office hours he's kind of awkward, but overall a fair and kind professor.

I have wanted to start a club that revolves around music for a while and so here it goes.

I want this club to teach people the ins and outs of the music industry, how to use GarageBand(for beginners), FL Studio, and many other music production/ beat making softwares. In addition to that I want the club to also have debates where people will defend artists to see which one is better or which one had more impact( and potentially win a prize). Also, the ability to collaborate with other creative clubs on campus( like a graphic design club to design mock album art for artists) The absolute dream would be to coordinate with ASPB UCR to allow us to contact the producer or sound engineer for many of the artist that come to our school to come in as a guest speaker.

In general I just want to create a social environment where people can hang out and meet people with similar interests.

This post is to look for people interested, people who have experience and can pass down their skills, and people who can hopefully share this with friends that they think would be interested. Additionally, I am looking for people to fill positions and help found the group.

I would like to hear what you guys have to think and what YOU want out of the group since the group is for everyone and is for all our collective benefit

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsWJ3aSa3ts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsWJ3aSa3ts)

I've been re-enacting the iconic running scene from 2017's hit film by Edgar Wright, Baby Driver (in my neighborhood) and it's a massive thrill. Ever since 2017, I can only run when I turn on Hocus Pocus ‚Äì Focus and re-enact the scene (just without the guns and cars). It's the best scene in the entire movie.

Yes, I repeat all of their lines... including my favorite: Buddy - ""WHAT DID YOU DO BABY??!! WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO???!!!!"" Baby - (smirking) ""I moved."". I re-enact the parkour, then the police yelling ""GET OUT OF THE WAY, OUT OF THE WAY!!.... THERE HE IS! GO GO GO"", Baby's expressions and his running. And yeah, I grab myself and slam myself like Buddy does to Baby in that part of the scene. I pretend to throw people out of my way as I run (as Baby does). I can do this in a loop for hours. Never gets old. (Sure, I might be crazy but it's effective at weight loss and as an exercise routine. Not to mention it's fun and gives me a rush of adrenaline).

I recently passed by UCR on my way back home and noticed that it's the perfect place for re-enactment. Lots of space and buildings (which could represent the mall Baby runs into).

Since the campus appears to be closed and no students are present, I don't think it would be too big of a deal if I re-enacted the scene at UCR. My only worry is that campus security may stop me. Thus, I ask, is campus security at UCR strict in the sense that they would stop me if I re-enacted the scene?",0.16217105263157894,0.5507309941520467,riverside

I was super excited for the courses I was enrolled in (before COVID-19),  but I've had the hardest time keeping myself accountable for the simplest things like completing weekly readings and attending zoom discussions- I am not learning at all and have fallen so behind on assignments.

 I have submitted the enrollment adjustment form to change the grading basis to S/NC for 2/3 upper div classes this quarter. I am very grateful they are offering this option. If I am being honest, I feel like just giving up and taking the NC for those 2 courses. Considering I am a third year, I have the opportunity to potentially retake these same courses and still graduate on time. I've planned what my 4th year will look like and have scheduled a meeting with my advisor later this week to talk bout it. 

Is anyone else having an extremely difficult time? 

 I feel both guilty and at peace with my decisions. While I feel shameful for just giving up, I also feel like being honest about my capabilities will release a lot of stress.

Super lax deadlines and mulligans. If I score low on an assignment, tell me where I did wrong and have me redo whatever it is you want me to learn.

Also, grant a reasonable amount of time to missed deadlines. An assignment is due at 6Pm on Ilearn. Don't say anything, but allow me to contact you and request an extra (reasonable amount of time) to complete it.

&amp;#x200B;

My professors have done this during these hard times and DAMM it feels good. Feels like they care. And the pressure is less. I still have that deadline floating in my mind. Thats a good thing really. But if I don't make it for whatever reason, and I contact you regarding extra time, just grant it. 3 days is enough time. (Lets be honest, the class assignments probably wont be graded in 3 days anyway ;))

I had to go to admissions and record several times and had to email multiple departments. The department chair of my major had to approve some of my pre req courses and every quarter I have to submit a form. And every single time without fault they reach out and argue that I STILL don‚Äôt have the classes. No matter how early I submit the form they always give me such a hard time allowing me to register for my upper divs. It‚Äôs caused me to miss my registration days and has extended my start at UCR just because they couldn‚Äôt get my classes right.

I know its my ultimate decision by the end of the day or by 12PM tomorrow but I was wondering, is it worth S/NC'ing a breadth course? The class is graded by 4 essays and discussion. So far, I have a 75 in the class due to one of the first essays being graded. I recently submitted another essay but is unsure when my grade will be posted for it. I'm unsure of what to do. Its a CHASS course and since I don't know the outcome of my grade from the recent and upcoming final essay, should I S/NC as insurance to not hurt my GPA? I'm taking only 3 courses this quarter but because I'm still unsure of how this particular breadth will play out and my final grade will be, I don't know if not S/NC'ing will jeopardize my final GPA for Spring 2020.

But idk, I know it sounds kind of bad but I think hybrid classes would be kind of a rip off. To have hybrid classes means we HAVE to be near campus, so if you normally live far you gotta find a place near here and pay rent :/. On top of that, the classes that‚Äôll be in person will most likely just be labs and discussions if we‚Äôre even lucky enough. I just feel like it‚Äôs not worth it to have only those classes in person but then have to pay the full regular tuition PLUS rent. I am happy that more people will be at UCR and I can see my friends again, but I think the cons kind of outweigh the pros here. I don‚Äôt know if anyone feels the same way, since everyone I‚Äôve asked only seemed happy about having hybrid classes. 

On top of this.. it‚Äôs likely the dining hall will be takeout,  and the hub might be closed, or will only let like 10 people in at a time. The club meetings won‚Äôt be normal, we‚Äôll still have to social distance when hanging out with friends, block party may not be happening, and just in general ‚Äî a lot of the other fees we pay for on campus stuff won‚Äôt be worth it. 

Right now I just feel like it should all be online or it should all be in person. I‚Äôd much rather have all in person classes (who wouldn‚Äôt??) but that just doesn‚Äôt seem realistic at this point since even if things are calmed down, we‚Äôll be risking another outbreak if we don‚Äôt have a vaccine out... and a vaccine takes long to create and distribute. One case turned into over 1.5 million in the matter of a few months... imagine still having thousands of cases and just returning to our normal practices? That‚Äôs a huge risk to not only the elderly and diseased, but to our healthcare system as well. So in person classes, to me, just seem unrealistic. Because of this, I feel like fall classes would just be most ideal in terms of money if we‚Äôre only gonna be having labs (and maybe discussions if we‚Äôre lucky) in person.

I‚Äôm only listing a bunch of things I see wrong with the hybrid classes. The only thing good I can see about them for now is the on campus environment (which won‚Äôt even really be the same) and the fact that we can see our friends again.

What do you guys think about hybrid classes? I wanna know more about the pros and if you guys think it‚Äôs worth it",0.1606699830384041,0.623857185699291,riverside

I had been debating whether to drop my CS class but then I realized last minute I better drop it since even if I complete all labs/future assignments I‚Äôd most likely be ending with a D. So I go to drop my class at 2pm, and realize I missed the deadline. I emailed my academic advisor as soon as I could mentioning my error and the toxic environment that has caused my grades to decline to which they respond with ‚Äúit‚Äôs a HARD deadline, you can fill out the form but it‚Äôs likely to be denied.‚Äù 
The form requires documentation of a change in circumstance which is where I‚Äôm struggling with.
 But quite honestly how can I document the shit I‚Äôve been going through?? Being in a toxic household things are always changing, I thought I could handle it and I can‚Äôt anymore. The longer I‚Äôm here the more comfortable my parents get in acting like how they used to. Sorry advisor that I can‚Äôt document it, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not real. 

I don‚Äôt care if I have a W on my transcript I just NEED to get out of this class. I‚Äôm at my breaking point, I can‚Äôt handle all the stress in my life outside of school let alone with a class looming in the background that I know EVEN with effort I‚Äôm only going to get a D but then I don‚Äôt want to do nothing either and just default to an F but I just don‚Äôt have any strength left at all or fuel in the tank.

 I really thought there‚Äôd be SOME compassion though. I‚Äôm mad at myself for being this dumb but I‚Äôm ngl I‚Äôm also mad that there‚Äôs no empathy on the other end? Like yes i was an idiot for being indecisive and waiting till the last minute, but I‚Äôm also a human being in a crisis who just misread something.

* Don't wait until week 8 to decide if you're going to take classes at a CC because classes will fill up before you even get a chance to look. Like UCR certain students will register first depending on the criteria they meet. As a UCR student it may be possible you will get the last possible date to register. This can possibly be avoided by talking to your UCR AA and an academic Counselor at the CC you want to go to ahead of time. Each CC has a timeline of important dates on their website, you just go to find them.
* If you plan on going, expect to pay out of pocket. Each school's tuition for classes varies but it's generally within the $40 dollar range per unit. So a 3 unit course would be $120+. You won't be able to get financial aid from both UCR and the CC you're attending
* Make sure you let academic advisor know before you even take a class to see if you can transfer it. I know there are many advisors aren't really good, but they will tell you if a class can counted for.
* From what I've read, all parts of English 1 have to be taken at UCR. 
* Remember, CC classes are lower division courses so if a CC has a class you need make sure that your college accepts the lower division version of the class. For example, every CC offers stats but life science majors must have an upper div stats course (Stat 100A) for it to count on your Degree Audit. 

There is more I could say but i can''t think of them at this moment so if you have questions, I'll try my best to answer",0.2733766233766234,0.47837301587301595,riverside

The university already lost millions this past quarter, and might lose more if Fall is online. It will be close to bankrupt if this goes into 2021. Also, there is NO tuition reduction. $5K for one quarter is a scam, but that happening for 3 quarters and it being $15K? In what world would people accept that?! It‚Äôs insanity, and hundreds will defer or take a leave of absence. 

Not to mention, the mental health of the student body will go straight to hell. Long term isolation will have drastic effects on us young adults, and we‚Äôll feel disconnected to friends, campus, and resources that are needed for a successful college career. 

For Winter, I think the large lectures will happen online, but smaller and medium classes shouldn‚Äôt have a problem happening in-person, since treatments should be available for COVID by late fall. Then a vaccine sometime early 2021, then we can all go about our lives without restrictions. 

I‚Äôm sorry if this comes off as rude, or random. I‚Äôve been hearing people talk about the whole year being online, and it makes me upset and anxious because that is where this has gone to far. Plus, it doesn‚Äôt make sense for it to happen, and the university will literally shoot itself in the foot if this shit goes past 2020.",-0.001105442176870763,0.5180272108843538,riverside

1. I‚Äôm undecided on an academic major, and junior college might give me more time to explore with less financial pressure.

2. Online or hybrid courses in the Fall would probably not be worth the cost.

The downsides are that I would lose some personal pride and I would have to move back in with my parents (they‚Äôre nice but still).

But Here are some highlights: 

‚ÄúSeveral safeguards are also built into the process to help mitigate cheating. Students show their IDs next to their faces before the exam and testing sessions are recorded so faculty and TAs can review afterward. A password is required to initiate the exam, and receipt of student submissions are confirmed before students can exit the exam. Proctors can ‚Äúpin‚Äù specific videos if they notice suspicious activity, enlarging them to full screen and monitoring individuals independently.‚Äù

In my opinion, the main reason campuses are being reopened is because of the $1.2 billion loss and more projected loss if campuses were to stay closed. CSU's have already announced that they are closed during fall but UC's will now be open. It would be considered a hybrid form of higher education with large lectures being suspended and only small classes and labs will meet on campus. It will be a mixture of online and in-person instruction.

Quote: Napolitano indicated that each UC campus would be required to ‚Äúmeet system-wide thresholds‚Äù for Covid-19 testing, contact tracing and isolation before being allowed to open.
Once the standards are met, campuses ‚Äúcan consider whether to maintain fully remote instruction in the fall or return some portion of their students to campus.‚Äù

2809,Help,2,2020-06-01 14:40:39,6,"I stumbled upon a forum (Stormfront) today and I am livid about how people can be so sadistic and inhumane towards one another. One thread was titled ‚ÄúNegroes scare people-why‚Äù and described blacks as wild, dangerous, and thugs who needed to be ‚Äúput in place‚Äù. Another thread about a black man being dragged by a Fed-Ex driver had comments saying the black man ‚Äúdeserved to die‚Äù and ‚ÄúIt felt satisfying to watch‚Äù. It‚Äôs repulsive that one can look at another human being and wish death upon that person. There‚Äôs yet another thread saying those who believe that racial violence exists are brainwashed. After calling them out in my thread ‚Äúto the oppressors, those who abuse their power...‚Äù, they labeled me as a Marxist and even said that a sect Christians in whites should be ‚Äúculled to control them as pests‚Äù even though it has nothing to do with my statements. It‚Äôs astounding how with science and technology, these people are still saying that blacks are a different species based on DNA. I‚Äôm not normally one to speak on public forums, but I encourage you to go on their opposing forum and flood it with threads, showing that oppression is unacceptable. 
 
Even though you‚Äôre probably tired of hearing and seeing these media posts, but only a few people voicing out isn‚Äôt significant enough to drown out their voices.

2847,UCR Shouldn't Implement Hybrid Classes,1,2020-06-02 19:03:14,38,"Although it isn't confirmed yet, I just can't wrapped my head around why there would be a need to have hybrid classes during the Fall. Sure, I miss the way things used to be but the benefits definitely do not outweigh the cost. I feel like this is just a tactic for making students pay full tuition for UCs. I am hoping that they make it, at least, optional. So many students could be negatively affected by this and I feel like they should be considered:

Commuting Students:
Commuters already have enough stress driving back and forth from home/work to campus. With hybrid classes, it would be such a huge waste of gas money and time just to go to class for such a short period of time. Also, some commuters may have to stay on campus longer in order to make it on time for ""online lectures"" when they could just do everything in the comforts of their own home. 

International/Out of State Students:
These students are already at a distance from their families/homes. Some are hundreds of miles away or even overseas. Hybrid classes will definitely not be worth it if they are still getting very minimal interaction from these short classes. In addition, many students would still like to be with family members during these struggling times. (Note: This does not apply to abusive households. I hope you are all safe!)

Student &amp; Coronavirus:
Many students are still facing the fear of catching Covid-19 and are highly worried to come back to campus. I find this completely understandable because there has not even been a medical vaccine made yet. Even if there were, we would have to find a time where everyone could access it and that could take months. Furthermore, I assume that there will be many health regulations that students would have to follow on campus. This can all be avoided if classes stayed online.

Housing leasing:
Hybrid classes would mean that students would have to find new housing leases to sign. Most of these leases are about one year long. They are also extremely hard to back out of. For non-STEM majors, hybrid classes are only in-person discussions which are about an hour long. This means that students would be going to class 3-4 hours a week. Why it be necessary to sign a new lease just to go to a couple of classes?

Students w/ finacial issues:
Furthermore, many students right now are facing financial issues due to the pandemic. Some are even struggling to afford the basic necessities. On top of that, the school is continuing to make us pay full tuition. We also have to pay for textbooks along with other school supplies as well. In result, some students are considering dropping out because they don't have the funds to pay.

~~~~~
If anyone has anything they would like to add, please comment. I am considering making a petition, but I am also looking to see if anyone has anything opposing thoughts. My only concerns are staff members who are struggling to find work/not getting paid.",0.1328103237342368,0.4860404510947988,riverside

**Measures passed by UCR Executive Council of the Academic Senate on June 4, 2020:**



* R1.1.4 A student may drop a course without prior approval no later than the end of the second full week of instruction. **For Spring 2020, from the third full week of instruction through  the end of the term (quarter), a course may be dropped with the approval  of the advisor.** For Summer, 2020, from the third through the tenth full week of  instruction, a course may be dropped with the approval of the advisor.  Any course drop which would reduce the undergraduate student's academic  load to less than 12 units must be approved  by the Dean. 

&amp;#x200B;

* R1.1.5  If a student drops a course before the end of the eighth full week of  instruction in Spring 2020, no indication will be entered in the  permanent transcript.  Deans may permit undergraduate students to withdraw after the eighth  week on a case-by-case basis, in which case a transcript symbol of W,  signifying withdrawal, entered in the grade column. **For Spring and Summer 2020, no indication of courses dropped  during these quarters will appear in students‚Äô permanent transcripts.** Students who withdraw while repeating a course previously taken may register for another attempt in a later quarter.

I took Bio5B with Redak and Campbell this quarter and the way that they have conducted their class this quarter in my opinion felt more destructive than good and I can confidently say that I learned virtually nothing in their class. At the beginning of this quarter I was really struggling due to the fact that I live alone and was struggling with feelings of isolation and spiraling anxiety induced depression and truly just felt lost and like nothing I could do mattered. After doing poorly in the first half of the class(D+) , I reached out to my professors and let them know that I was struggling, but still wanted to turn my grade around. They responded by telling me to either drop the class or do better. That response made me feel embarrassed that I‚Äôd even asked and like was just a piece of meat. And as such, I forced myself to stop processing the pain I was going through and just focused on memorizing the course materials, since failing or dropping this class really isn‚Äôt an option for me, if I want to graduate on time. Other students in my class have also tried to reach out to them, but received the same response. Even now they have continued their complacency throughout the Pandemic and BML movement and unlike my other professors, they haven‚Äôt made any efforts to meet us 1/2 way, as we‚Äôre trying to complete this course I‚Äôm the middle of a Pandemic and much needed social justice uprising. Pretty much all of their lectures for this class were pre-recorded in March (which has also made it really hard to learn) and I guess they felt like sending an email talking about what‚Äôs going on is/was too much work. 

I‚Äôve had a lot of professors that have really stood  up to the plate and did their best to make learning during these times possible. They‚Äôve either just taken the time to talk to us or made the course more passable with curving. Seeing them made it even more clear to me that Redak and Campbell‚Äôs inaction isn‚Äôt due to their hands being tied, it‚Äôs just straight complacency.

To whom it may concern,
The students of UCR are outraged by the lack of help and care shown by the professors of the CNAS undergraduate branch. While CHASS majors experienced significant help and changes to better accommodate students, not only was there barely any change this quarter for CNAS students, professors ended up grading harder due to a perceived increase in cheating. Many students have felt this quarter that professors have been hard to reach, and honestly privileged in their ability to ignore ongoing current events. In the wake of Covid-19 as well as the riots and protests that are happening right this second, our professors have not only been unhelpful but stricter. Examples include professor Larsen who treats her students like children, answering their questions with pointed commentary and sarcasm aimed to degrade and make the students feel uncomfortable. Professor Anderson effectively told students that their only option was to either retake the class fall quarter or take a final exam during one of the most crazy and mentally draining times.
The simple fact is these professors are privileged in being able to stay home and act as if everything is normal. Nothing is normal for the students at a university whose claim to fame is being diverse and being helpful to students in need. The actions of the professors and CNAS department as a whole doesn‚Äôt reflect the diversity and struggle that many students experience just to attend college. As a university that claims to help and serve minorities, your professors have marginalized our voices and made us feel worthless on countless occasions. We demand a cultural change, one where professors must recognize the struggle many students face. We demand the unconditional support from our faculty to our students, and the ability to make our finals only help our grades, not hurt it. In a time where many students are wondering whether or not their next breath is their last, professors should do well to acknowledge that not all people are able to ignore the turmoil in this country and provide a way to ease their stress instead of adding onto it.",0.09058652729384437,0.5736875725900116,riverside

2944,Growing Housing Concerns,1,2020-06-05 12:33:31,1,"Dear Fellow UCR Students,  


I have seen discussion here regarding issues at UCR Housing, especially during this global crisis. 

I want to let you know that concerns across UCR housing and family housing are amplifying.  


On Friday, May 29th, the Labor Alliance and Family Housing sent an email to Chancellor Wilcox and the Vice Chancellors. In this email, we detail a list of demands specific to the current housing crisis across campus. We believe this issue is widespread, beyond graduate students, and beyond family housing.  


The Labor Alliance and Family Housing has requested a response from the administration by today (June 5th). So far, we have not heard back and no decisions have been made public to us. Given events that unfolded in the past few days, regarding the lack of available leases and issued statements of denied housing renewals, we are increasingly afraid of what housing may try to do. As of now, no one (at least in Family Housing) has seen a lease for July 1st 2020. Our leases all end June 30th. Many residents have already been issued statements from the university that they are ineligible to renew their leases.  


I am sharing this message with you in solidarity of my neighbors, friends, and colleagues.  


We are spreading awareness now because we have requested a response by the university and housing administration today. As of Noon 6/5/20, I am not aware of a response yet.  


I will continue to share this message, and I ask that you do as well.

I am including the email sent on May 29th from UCR Labor Alliance.

I'm just reaching out to see how you're all feeling about the current state of life, and what your thoughts are if COVID-19 continues to affect everyone through the year, potentially into 2021 and beyond. I've heard quite a few people are considering temporarily withdrawing/taking a break, others want to transfer to another college, a couple have unfortunately dropped out, possibly more, and the majority of people don't know what to do, or haven't thought about it. Any feedback or ideas to share with everyone else would be great. We can all get through this together. I know many people have also applied for unemployment or CAL AID or CAL Fresh (food stamps). Even finding employment is crazy difficult right now. We are all going through problems, but most of us share similarities in the obstacles we face. I hope this serve serves as a place to help each other communicate ways we can alleviate our problems. Maybe you can share something you think others might find helpful. Anything at all. I just hope everyone's mental state remains strong and stable. There are many who are in a dark place, and they especially value being reached out to. So, if you haven't heard from a friend or someone you know in a while, please check up on them. You're not alone. Don't forget about the people around you. Sometimes we are too focused on ourselves to notice others are hurting, even though they are nearby. I know Finals suck, so, don't let it get to you. There are solutions in the works and other alternatives that will be offered as opportunities to save our grades and ourselves from any academic trouble that may become a problem. So, just be patient, stick it out, stick it out with your friends, and encourage others to push through. There is no direction but forward, and if you want to make a counter argument to that statement, unless it involves time travel in a realistic sense, I don't want to hear it. Because we only stop moving forward if we cease to exist or you're an inter-dimensional being and can travel freely through time. I hope you are all doing better than fine. Fine isn't good enough. Maintain positive mentally and an optimistic perspective. Your mind is a powerful entity. We vibe to everything around us. Be aware of others around you, and just look out for the safety of others. Let's get through this together. Stay Strong Everyone!

Sharing this message to staff from UCR Staff Assembly President Crystal Petrini as well as letters sent to Chancellor Kim Wilcox and the UC Regents and President Janet Napolitano.

Cheers to all and good luck with finals.  


\--------------  


Dear UCR family,

The past week has been exceptionally difficult for many of us, but especially for the black staff, faculty, and students in our community. I, along with the Staff Assembly Executive Board, am saddened, disheartened, and angered by the national events regarding police brutality. Recognizing the importance of elevating black voices during this time, we are working closely with UCR's Black Faculty And Staff Association's Executive Board to craft a joint statement regarding these matters and hope to release it over the next week.

While Staff Assembly is proud to stand as the preeminent source of staff engagement and activities for UCR, we equally value our importance as advocates on staff matters.

As you know, the University of California system in general and UCR in particular are facing significant budget challenges. The global pandemic of COVID-19 has created circumstances that is forcing the state of California and UC system to make difficult decisions. These circumstances pose significant challenges for all UC campuses but especially UCR's given its historic underfunding and staffing deficit.

Recognizing this, the Staff Assembly Executive Board has crafted two letters over the past few weeks to ensure system and campus leadership are aware of our stance on these matters as well as how to move forward. Both letters have been attached for your review. 

The first letter was been sent to Chancellor Kim Wilcox and copied to all senior management. The second letter was sent to the Board of Regents for the University of California as well as UC President Janet Napolitano.

In lieu of our typical engagement events, we have decided to dedicate this week to advocacy, in any and all forms.

One suggestion is to write your own letter to the legislature through the UC Advocacy Network (UCAN) here. There‚Äôs a template already in the orange box, but you can edit/create your own letter as well.

Staff Assembly is proud to stand with you on these matters and will continue to do so.

Thank you for everything you do for our campus and our community during these trying times. By working with and for each other, we can and will emerge stronger on the other side.

Warm regards,

Crystal Petrini,MBA  
President, UCR Staff Assembly

They said that if we did take the final (‚Äúto help boost our grade‚Äù) the total would be 220 (final was 60 points). If I got 60/60 on the final then I would have 150 out of 220, which is still a D!! So how was it supposed to be optional to boost our grades if it meant that the total score would be higher?!!

## About this Event

‚ÄúLife's most persistent and urgent question is: 'What are you doing for others?"" - MLK

As a white male that benefits most from this system, I can no longer stand by and watch this unlawful system continue to marginalize, suppress, violate, infringe upon BIPOC rights, and kill my Black brother and sisters. Complacency is racism and I refuse to be complicit in the unfair treatment of BIPOC and other marginalized groups. Having a partner who is a woman of color, I can not in my right mind look my future daughter or son in the eyes and tell them I stood by as people were treated unfairly based on the color of their skin.

Please join me in this peaceful rolling rally past all of Riverside County &amp; Municipal Offices (including City Hall, DA's office, Police Station, Sherifs station, County, State, and Federal courts), calling for swift policy reform to bring an end to policy brutality, defund police departments, and put money into underserved communities.

We will meet in the parking lot of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and proceed to slowly drive through downtown (up Lemon street, down Orange Street, and then up Main street), where the majority of the city and counties offices and law enforcement stations are located. I will have car markers in order make safely put any peaceful messages on your car you wish to calling for these actionable changes.

Please do not hesitate to reach out to me in order to discuss the event. Feedback is welcome. I want this event to be impactful as possible.

This event is free. In return for the markers to make signage I simply ask that you make a donation to the charity of your choice that will help bring about the changes that are long overdue.",0.05132731253420908,0.49592227695675983,riverside

Long time reader, first time poster. I've been going through this sub, reading everyone's concerns about online learning. I'll be TA'ing in CHASS this fall, and wanted to know how to better serve you in the classroom. Here are some questions I have:

* What were your expectations for online learning?

* What kind of support from professors and TA's do you wish you had received? 
* Did you feel heard in the Zoom class? 
* What didn't work in the Zoom classroom?
* What is your ideal online learning experience?

Secondly, how do I take courses in the summer?

I attached the three year pathway to graduating from my major and if anyone has any tips or advice on specific classes, that would be awesome.

3145,Rolling Rally II,2,2020-06-12 20:37:23,1,"[Another peaceful drive by County/City offices with signage calling for the equal treatment of BIPOC, the end of police brutality, and reform](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/rolling-rally-ii-for-black-lives-matter-tickets-109433873662)

About this Event

The first rolling rally held on 6/12 was successful with the community coming together to stand in solidarity. That being said, It is not enough!! MLK said, ""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."" Embodying Dr. King's words, we will continue to meet and call for systemic change until there is justice, equality, and equity for BIPOC.

As a white male that benefits most from this system, I can no longer stand by and watch this unlawful system continue to marginalize, suppress, violate, infringe upon BIPOC rights, and kill my black brother and sisters. Complacency is racism and I refuse to be complicit in the unfair treatment of BIPOC and other marginalized groups. Having a partner who is a woman of color, I can not in my right mind look my future daughter or son in the eyes and tell them I stood by as people were treated unfairly based on the color of their skin.

Please join me in this peaceful rolling rally past all of Riverside County &amp; Municipal Offices (including City Hall, DA's office, Police Station, Sherifs station, County, State, and Federal courts), calling for swift policy reform to bring an end to policy brutality, defund police departments, and put money into underserved communities.

We will meet in the parking lot of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and proceed to slowly drive through downtown (up Lemon street, down Orange Street, and then up Main street), where the majority of the city and counties offices and law enforcement stations are located. I will have car markers in order put any peaceful messages on your car you wish to calling for actionable changes.

Date And Time

Please do not hesitate to reach out to me in order to discuss the event. Feedback is welcome. I want this event to be impactful as possible.

This event is free. In return for the markers to make signage I simply ask that you make a donation to the charity of your choice that will help bring about the changes that are long overdue.

Some might think I might be biased, but I have no reason to be. I ended up getting an A in the class, but no thanks to him.

Maybe it's because I'm still a freshman, and haven't had a ""bad"" professor yet, but I doubt it. I've taken a few upper divs, and pretty much finished all my under-divs for CS and haven't even stumbled upon a ""bad"" professor.

Idk, just had to vent. Guess I was surprised to find a prof this horrible, when everyone tells me otherwise. Especially when all the other profs I've had were incredible.

He's probably a favorite among students cause his class is an easy A. ",0.0412878787878788,0.5928030303030304,riverside

About this Event

The first rolling rally held on 6/12 was successful with the community coming together to stand in solidarity. That being said, It is not enough!! MLK said, ""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."" Embodying Dr. King's words, we will continue to meet and call for systemic change until there is justice, equality, and equity for BIPOC.

As a white male that benefits most from this system, I can no longer stand by and watch this unlawful system continue to marginalize, suppress, violate, infringe upon BIPOC rights, and kill my black brother and sisters. Complacency is racism and I refuse to be complicit in the unfair treatment of BIPOC and other marginalized groups. Having a partner who is a woman of color, I can not in my right mind look my future daughter or son in the eyes and tell them I stood by as people were treated unfairly based on the color of their skin.

Please join me in this peaceful rolling rally past all of Riverside County &amp; Municipal Offices (including City Hall, DA's office, Police Station, Sherifs station, County, State, and Federal courts), calling for swift policy reform to bring an end to policy brutality, defund police departments, and put money into underserved communities.

We will meet in the parking lot of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and proceed to slowly drive through downtown (up Lemon street, down Orange Street, and then up Main street), where the majority of the city and counties offices and law enforcement stations are located. I will have car markers in order put any peaceful messages on your car you wish to calling for actionable changes.

3220,Is parking a problem at UCR? (Before COVID-19),1,2020-06-16 06:02:25,7,"Hello guys! Since the middle of last year, I‚Äôve been working on a project to address the parking problem at universities. I‚Äôve developed a business model that provides a solution to the problems I identified at FAU down in Florida, the university I went for my bachelors. Later, I realized from talking to students from other Universities, that the problem exists in most commuter universities, but the problems differ depending on how the schools handle their parking operations.

A group of friends and I decided to continue with the idea and we are committed to solving the problem by designing a solution focusing on the students, and not on the parking lot administrator. So, to help us build a better solution for the students, we are asking help from students at various universities to answer a few questions about their experience when commuting and parking on campus. We would appreciate your help with this! We are on the way to developing something GREAT for the infrastructure, not only for one university but for all other universities in the United States.

Please feel free to contact me directly if you have any questions.

The school has the street infront of it completely empty because teachers use the provided parking lot. There's room for like 20+ cars on this street. The only downside is that two days throughout the week sweepers come so there are signs saying you can't park during those times.

Anyways I parked there the entire last quarter and it was fine minus going back there like at 9pm because the two blocks from the parking lot to the school aren't lit up. That being said the streets were usually empty.

3249,Tips and advice from a recent BCOE grad,1,2020-06-16 22:31:08,4,"TL;DR Recent Grad giving some advice for getting into career after graduation.

&amp;#x200B;

As a recent BCOE grad, I figured I'd give y'all some tips/career advice for those either starting their schooling at UCR or are still attending. I wish I was told this stuff before/while I was attending and I hope that this can help at least one person out. 

As for context, I just graduated from UCR with my bachelor's in an engineering degree and have just recently also started my career the day after my last final. Hopefully most of y'all will be able to say the same thing in the next few years and able to start your careers right away cause being unemployed sucks.

Now for the tips and advice.

1. Don't pigeon hole yourself into a career path based on your major. You can do a variety of different things with an engineering degree. Most of the things you learn in school, won't necessarily be applicable to that in the field and 90% of what you do for work you will learn on the job. I say this especially for those in their 3rd of 4th year who like me have said ""wow, I absolutely hate engineering"". Finish the degree, its just a piece of paper saying you can commit to something and essentially just a tick mark next to a ""has a degree"" criteria for a job.
2. Get a job/experience while you are in school. Yeah I know... it freaking sucks to work 40 hours a week and have to take 16-18 units. I know... I've done it for the last three years. But if you go on indeed, calcareers, USAjobs, etc. every single job says ""needs x-years of experience"", even for entry level. Completely stupid, I know, but you got to play the system your given.  Try to get an entry level job that is somewhat related to the field. Yes it will pay pennies, yes it will suck, but you will learn a lot (hopefully) and you will be able to pad out that resume in order to meet minimum requirements for when you graduate and actually qualify for jobs you want (or jobs that pay well).
3. Go look at jobs you are interested in getting after you get your degree and look at the qualifications. Many require a lot of software that is unfortunately never taught at school. Examples include AutoCAD, GIS,  Python, REMUS, CAD/CAM, Access, etc. Go learn the software early. Many of these are available via the UCR IT software license program and many have free tutorials online on how to become proficient with them. These will greatly improve your chances in finding quick employment post graduation. 
4. Apply. Apply. Apply. And when you've applied, apply to more and start applying early. I've applied during these last six months to 100 different agencies and companies and have gotten a total of 4 call backs and offers. Yep that's right, 4% success rate. (It usually isn't this bad but COVID-19 is making hiring difficult). Don't get discouraged it is always like this (maybe not 4% success bad, but its pretty bad still).

Some other things more unrelated to careers.

1. Actually go to class. You may think, eh it's pointless, but it builds good habits and also, you never know, maybe you'll actually learn something. Or at the very least if you can't make it to class go over the material that was covered, and read the textbook. Failing a class sucks because your gonna have to retake the class and that wastes a lot of time and money (I know I've been there).
2. Assuming COVID-19 ends, and in person class resumes, don't pay for the gold parking pass. It's a waste of money. Get the orange pass and park at the International Village. You won't be able to find parking in the Gold lots unless your classes are at 0800.
3. Get involved on campus. My biggest regret of my entire college career is not being very involved in campus extracurricular activities. Join a club, sports team, whatever. There are many cool clubs that you will be able to find something you will enjoy and it is not that big of a commitment usually. 

Hopefully this helps somebody out. I'll be on for another couple of hours as I have some reporting to catch up on if anybody has any questions.",0.06663419913419912,0.43578849721706875,riverside

I think that this is really unfair considering the fact that we don't even get a grade for the workshop and it's not considered in the gpa since its S/NS. In addition, the whole W not showing up on transcripts because of covid19 only applies to Spring quarter. Should I ask my counselor about the 2 Ws? Since technically we weren't able to finish winter quarter on campus, shouldn't the W not appearing on transcript be an option for Winter quarter as well?",0.030555555555555558,0.48819444444444443,riverside

There was no way any of us could S/NC the course either because who the fuck would S/NC a course when his/her grade in the course is 95%++++? I bet the professors teaching these classes wouldn't.

It has great programs that some took advantage of (because how many people are actually able to land a job before graduation or get into any other program) but **if you don't take advantage of any of it you won't go anywhere**. **The name won't do shit for you** **so if you don't have an internship/job/research position - watch out because a BS/BA doesn't mean anything without any experience.**  

I know this reads spiteful as fuck but I honestly don't care since I'm literally never coming back here or anywhere near it. **I just want you to know that if you are here, you will only do great things if you work for great things.** The career center is cancer (extremely predatory practice where they DISCOURAGE so many things you should do) and financial aid office is useless (need I say more lmao everyone literally gets ghosted).

3329,HELP!! Will advisors allow me to take 5 upper divs in 1 quarter? How hard would it be?,1,2020-06-19 22:36:49,6,"I have just begun my junior year and I am 5 POSC upper divs short of completing a Political Science degree and 9 upper divs short of a degree in Psychology. The only other classes I need to take are two language classes. I am planning to take 4 classes in Fall 2020, Summer 2021, and 5 classes in both Winter 2021 and Spring 2021. 

CONTEXT: I really don't care about engaging with the school through extracurriculars because I need to graduate a year earlier to save on expenses.

 I believe I can handle the workload because I have been taking 4 classes while spending most of my weekend working and traveling. The past upper divs I have been taking have not been difficult and I will also be leaving work to concentrate on school. I really enjoy POSC courses too. In summary, my concern is how academic advisors would react to this? Also, does it get harder? Any experience?

2. What should I expect at my orientation? I know it‚Äôs different because it‚Äôs online, but honestly I am really nervous that I‚Äôll be lost. Should I take a look at what classes I want to take before hand? I‚Äôm majoring in Comp Sci but I don‚Äôt really know the different course names and what I should be taking, should I look into this beforehand?

Hello everyone,

I am a college student and I know the feeling that high schoolers get when they are seniors. High school seniors feel overwhelmed and anxious about the college process. From deciding what schools to apply, starting the applications, and deciding what school to go to. I always wanted to start a mentorship program to help seniors through that process. My goal and plan is to create College Bound Mentorship and help around 50 seniors by pairing them up with a college student. The pairing will allow seniors to start connections with college students as well as to have someone who they will be able to¬† seek when they have questions. I know that my idea is still up in the air but It¬† wouldn't¬† be possible¬† to start it if I do not have Mentors to help out. Please fill out this google form if you are interested in helping out.

Thanks!

University of California, UC Berkeley; Cal; Berkeley; and Cal Berkeley are all improper and unacceptable ways to refer to the school. UCB, on the other hand, is acceptable.

As the system's newest campus, we feel that it is important to honor and maintain an appropriate level of n00bie-ness when referring our university's name. We feel that ""UCB"" represents our brand in the most appropriate way and emphasizes the fact that we are the newest and lowest ranking school in the UC system.

While it may be acceptable to refer to all other UC campuses as whatever you want, UCB is a different case, and we therefore request that you cease using anything but the name ""UCB"" to refer our school. Thank you.

Based on the email sent by the chancellor on June 17th, we will be having online classes in the fall. Okay so what about Winter? Spring? 

The issue arises with the academic year contract system of the Campus Apartments. If there are online classes in the fall and I cancel my contract because I won't be living there, I won't be able to take classes in the Winter if they are not online. If I dont cancel my contract and classes are online the entire academic year, I've wasted a bunch of money. I suppose I could wait until Fall quarter is over and then if Winter Quarter is online cancel, but what about Spring Quarter? 

It would be helpful if they had the option of adjusting the contract to start in any given quarter to help us out. I called up Housing Services and they said that they will be lenient on the cancellation fees but aside from that they aren't making any accommodations.

3452,Abolish Police at UCR - statement by Black Faculty Collective,1,2020-06-25 12:57:44,22,"Black people are not simply seeking to ‚Äúfeel safe‚Äù at UCR. Black students and faculty are demanding that *campus safety* be disarticulated from *policing* in ways that simultaneously address institutional permutations of antiblackness. The discourse of ‚Äúsafety‚Äù in statements released by UCR administrators fail to address this fundamental demand, which is a practical, modest, and achievable way for the institution to address and potentially begin to repair its histories of institutionalized antiblackness. Examples of such infrastructural transformation abound in and beyond the United States, and the recent events in Minneapolis suggest that such an agenda is not only feasible, but necessary for any community that takes Black *life* seriously.

We are not interested in neutrality. We demand restitution and structural change.

UCR cannot sufficiently address antiblackness if it cannot identify and engage its own failings, the beginning of which is to acknowledge that antiblackness is rampant. Public announcements, a play of abstract support for the Black student led Call to Action, absent concrete accountability and actionable follow through, are hollow. Are worse than meaningless.

Should this institution be worthy of our labors, our intellect, our scholarship, our artistry, our leadership, our excellence, or even our attention, then the specificity of our racialized, gendered experiences as Black people must be acknowledged aloud by UCR‚Äôs administrators, not appropriated, misrepresented, and re-narrated by them.

To this point, in support of demands already stated by the BSU‚Äôs Call to Action, Blackness Unbound is calling for the following:

1. Institutional commitment to increasing the recruitment and retention of Black graduate and undergraduate students.
2. Institutional commitment to increasing the recruitment of tenure-track and tenured Black faculty and the retention of Black faculty at all levels.

a. While we are facing a budgetary crisis, well-established UC programs including the UC Presidents and Chancellor's Postdoctoral Fellowship Program provide funding that can be used to hire Black scholars.

1. Defund the UCR campus police, and initiate necessary conversations and consultations to abolish the UCRPD in order to initiate a new paradigm for campus safety that is not steeped in antiblackness.
2. Invest financial resources in Black students, faculty and staff.
3. Invest financial and human resources in Black Studies programming and the foundation  
and sustainability of an autonomous Black Studies Department.
4. Radical budgetary transparency throughout the entire University.
5. Institutional commitment that any current, interim, or future CHASS and University  
administrative leadership will be committed to seeing these demands met, and to address them in partnership with Black faculty, students, and staff.

2

We call for immediate and thorough action on the demands outlined here, and expressed by BSU student leadership in its Call to Action.

In solidarity, Blackness Unbound

Please do not refer to UC Rivershit as ""UCR."" This is not the proper way to refer to the University of California's 6th and most okay campus. CalR'Side, Rivershit, Ratchetside or UOfCalR'atshit'Side are all proper and acceptable ways to say it. UCR, on the other hand, is not.

As the system's kinda prestigious and somewhat respected campus, we feel that it is important to observe and maintain an adequate level of respect for our university's name. We feel that ""UCR"" cheapens our brand and doesn't emphasize the okayness associated with CalR'Side.

While it may be acceptable to refer to **only** **UCB** in initialisms due to its lack of recognition and prestige, this is not acceptable for the 6th and occasionally forgotten campus, and we therefore request that everybody cease using the name ""UCR"" to refer our school. Thank you.

Don't say ""UCR"" when referring to UOfCalR'atshit'Side.

3482,Automatic F on a course if you haven't completed the prerequisites?,1,2020-06-26 19:38:00,6,"Hi everyone,

I'm a new incoming mechanical engineering transfer student at UC Riverside. I'm currently enrolled in two summer ME courses, and the deadline to drop courses with a full refund and no W grade is today the 26th. I got an email a few weeks ago from BCOE advising suggesting that students enroll in summer courses, and I did. Part of the process was that we needed to submit BCOE enrollment assistance forms because they were still processing transcripts and transfer courses.

Well, the thing is, I was allowed to enroll in a class without having previously completed one of its prerequisites, and it says in the syllabus for that class that if a student has not completed the prerequisites for that class, they will receive an F as the final grade for that class.

I'm really concerned about that and I'm not really sure what I should do, especially because the full refund and no W drop deadline is today the 26th (by 11:59pm I'm assuming). I emailed the professor on Wednesday at 6:33 pm but they have not replied.

Can the professor really give a student an F if they have not completed the prerequisites for a course, or is that something that happens automatically at UC Riverside? Even then, if I was allowed to enroll using a BCOE Enrollment Assistance Form, can they still give me an F if I haven't completed a prerequisite?

3524,"Tips From A Graduate Student: Preparing for Fall, Summer Academic Struggles",1,2020-06-30 12:25:26,5,"Good afternoon, everyone! With announcements being made, decisions going out, I just wanted to make a post to help you enter the summer (undergraduates in particular) and think about how to get ready for a predominately online fall quarter, which it's looking to be until something new comes out.  


A bit about myself, first: I'm a first-generation graduate student, having graduate UCR in 2017 with my BA, and took a year off before I then returned to finish my education, having just recently earned my Masters in CHASS. While I can't speak for all programs, let alone situations, I hope to give some advice that other graduate students, perhaps even instructors, could possibly add to if not begin a conversation.  


**For those of you already taking summer course:**  


* Stick with it. Communicate with your instructors, go to office hours (or what some instructors describe as Student Hours), and do the readings as possible, even if it means reading the introduction, a bit of the middle, and then some of the end. Set yourself up for success, particularly at this time in our lives.
* If you're also working to support yourself, your family and/or roommates: take time to yourself whenever you can. Take a walk or exercise, watch that YouTube video. Treat yourself to make work and education feel like something to accomplish, rather than a chore that exists to make life horrible.
* If you're homeless, lacking support, and struggling to push through: contact someone. It doesn't have to be your instructor, but it could be a friend, a peer, or student health services, case management. Follow r/UCR for updates, information on resources. Try not to let yourself fall behind, but if you do, don't shame yourself. These are terrible circumstances to do that to yourself, and while you may be the only one in your particular situation at this time, you're not the only who's gone to college on their own, while homeless, or possibly identifying as a BIPOC, LGBTQI\*, a veteran, etc.
* Set up a schedule for yourself to do homework, ""work,"" as though this is a second job. In graduate school, we're told to think of teaching as our day job, while research should be centered on our passion, interests, or at least something we're curious about; so that our research and ""homework"" can be seen as something exciting to take on. Try and think of school in this way, so that your actual day job, if you have one at the moment, can be a place of work while your school life can be something to reflect in.

These are only a few pointers, so feel free to add to them no matter who you are/what level you're at.

**For those of you waiting to take courses during the fall:**

* If you've already registered for courses, take a moment (at some point this summer) to think about your classes and what you hope to get out of them. Are they attached to your major, perhaps even a minor? How can your contact with the instructor or professor mean something, then, more than just trying to get a good grade? Is the class simply a requirement to knock off for upper div' classes? What is it about the material that may excite you? Why did you pick this course, professor, rather than another? These are small questions, but they and others can truly impact your success in the course, if not how you feel about it personally.
* If you haven't registered yet, what are some classes you're excited about taking, maybe even particularly online from a distance? Is it a language? How can learning from home allow you adequate time to practice, say, sign language or Korean? What if it's a STEM course? Surely we've seen the posts from just this past spring; what will you do in the event of, say, struggling with material? All in all, try and set the fall up for success, knowing you've spent some time thinking about the work, if not how to go about succeeding, asking for help, or networking online with other peers and possible graduate students.
* Do you have a study partner, a tutor? Do you want one? Make a post, here, on r/ucr, and maybe a graduate student not teaching your course could tutor you if you feel comfortable with their level, specialty, and aiding you in preparation. We grad students need work this summer, too. Again, set yourself up for success.
* What resources are available to you, or what questions do you have in finding a space online that you can call your own in a time of need? Look up the Academic Resource Center (ARC), requirements in past courses. Investigate if there's a center for you, say, if you identify as Latinx, Black, or LGBTQI\*. Maybe these centers will have mentoring available for you, or at least guide you to resources that can be fruitful now and into the coming fall quarter.
* Have you struggled with writing, math, or some other subject, field of study? Now is a good time, if able or applicable, to try and return to some skills you know you need some help in. Ask for some advice from past colleagues, maybe even graduate students if any are offering their time. Practice writing a thesis or complex sentence by visiting OWL at [owl.purdue.edu](https://owl.purdue.edu), and checking out their available online resources, study sections.

These are only a few recommendations, and they certainly don't qualify for every question or concern you may personally have, but think over the summer how learning online in the fall, if not this summer, can be something to successfully manage by looking for available resources, guidance, and opportunities early on. Covid-19 has shown how much we need our community in order to succeed, however said community may look or whatever size it may be for you. Start building your own little community of support and success, and start thinking about where preparing for success may lead you if not take some weight off you in the near future.

Like i understand being able to be done with ochem in 9 weeks is great and all but the class is literally so gruesome and so discouraging. Idk maybe im the only one who feels that way but i just feel like such shit after checking my midterm 2 grade and failing. like all of last week, i am not exaggerating by saying, the only thing i did was study ochem or take breaks from studying ochem. its so ridiculous that they make us learn just as much as normal ochem in 1/3 of the time. and the labs are so fucking stupid like my ta just gave me D on a lab report like how tf do u expect me to have the same kind of report as a person who a. is actually doing the lab in person and b. is doing 1 lab a week vs us who are doing 3 reports a week when you literally lecture using a ppt for 15 min and call it a day. not to mention having a midterm a week with 3 chapters of materials to read using a book that sucks at explaining shit. I literally just feel like i havent learned anything at all. this program is literally what is wrong w education because theyre just showing us to prioritize taking classes just to move forward in our degree vs actually learning and understanding the material bc imo it's literally impossible to learn this material this fast and actually be able to apply it to life and answering questions to the level he expects us to.  not to mention switzer is dick and honestly if he spent more time on his lectures and working on teaching us rather than forming his case for scaip it would be way more useful and hed be doing his job. this sounds really mean ik im just super frustrated about doing so poorly after working so hard and literally not doing anything besides ochem the past couple weeks. with that said the only good thing about this program is the SI leaders who are just doing such a good job i wish they could do the lectures. 

For those of you who are taking summer ochem or have taken it before and are doing/ did well some tips would be really useful bc im just out of energy at this point",0.0019308943089430867,0.567987804878049,riverside

Having a partner who is a woman of color, I can not in my right mind look my future daughter or son in the eyes and tell them I stood by as people were treated unfairly based on the color of their skin.

Please join me in this peaceful rolling rally past all of Riverside County &amp; Municipal Offices (including City Hall, DA's office, Police Station, Sherifs station, County, State, and Federal courts), calling for swift policy reform to bring an end to policy brutality, defund police departments, and put money into underserved communities.

We will meet in the12th Street parking lot and proceed to slowly drive through downtown (up Lemon street, down Orange Street, and then up Main street), where the majority of the city and counties offices and law enforcement stations are located. I will have car markers in order put any peaceful messages on your car you wish to calling for actionable changes.

I am therefore offering to help teach students how to approach written assignments in order to produce work that is appropriately formal, concise, and correctly cited.

Tutoring sessions may be used to revise or build outlines for papers and other written assignments, as well as review resumes, cover letters, and other application documents.

I would also be happy to work with any international students who feel they are struggling with certain skills in English. Through years of foreign language teaching, I understand the challenges that non-native speakers face and so ensure that my lessons are tailored to students‚Äô individual proficiency levels and interests.

So I went ahead and signed lease in LA for the next year.

It's a private bedroom with attached private bathroom. There's only one roommate who also has his own private bedroom and bathroom and is a pretty chill guy. There's an in-unit washer and dryer too which is pretty dope. Whole thing is $1041 per month, which covers utilities, wifi, apartment fees, and parking costs in addition to rent.

3812,APARTMENT LEASE CANCELLATION,1,2020-07-16 17:22:55,33,"Hi everyone, a lot of students are having trouble canceling their lease at various off-campus apartment complexes (University Village Towers, Grandmarc, Doug Wetton owned Properties, etc.) Many of us signed leases for the upcoming school year prior to the announcement that the majority of fall quarter would be online. There are also a lot of students who were unable to break their leases once COVID-19 broke out and spring quarter went online. Personally, I was told that if I wanted to break my lease I had to pay for the remaining months of rent on my lease even if the unit is empty. It's unfortunate that these corporations are trying to capitalize off of struggling college students and a pandemic. It's clear that they have no intention of making accommodations so we NEED to bring this to the attention of Riverside city and county officials.

**Who are we?** 

The Highlander exists to serve its readership, comprised of the community at and around University of California, Riverside and the Inland Empire as a whole. In our pursuit of the truth, we will provide accurate information relevant to the experiences and interests of our readers. We have been providing campus news and Highlander views since 1954. We strive to go above and beyond basic reporting by implementing vigorous investigations, creative thinking processes and a thorough analysis of the facts. 

**What sections do we write about and cover?**

We cover areas such as News, Features, Opinions, Arts and Entertainment and Sports!

**Besides writing, what other areas do we have?** 

The Newspaper has other areas besides writing that contributes to the production of our issues and online articles. These areas include photography, videography, marketing, graphic design, business/office management, ad representation and tech and distribution management. 

**How can we get involved?** 

If you are interested in writing, photography, or videography, you can become a contributor in which you will volunteer your work to The Highlander.

Once you are nominated and approved as a staff member, you will then be compensated based on the work you submit.

Quick Introduction: The DVC at UCR was started by Richard Nguyen (DJ Simplex) on Jan. 2014 as a means to create UCR's first network of deejays. A club extended from San Diego to Riverside, the DVC brings people together with a similar passion for music. Today, the club continues to act as a network, while additionally providing new and aspiring deejays the lessons and experience required to become a great deejay.

In the past, DVC has played at UCR's Block Party, Heat Music Festival and Spring Splash concerts. Our alumni &amp; current deejays have gone on to deejay at Coachella, Sevilla of Riverside, Teregram Ballroom Los Angeles and Brownies &amp; Lemonade.

No prior deejay, music production or music experience is required to join DVC at UCR. General meetings range from discussions about deejay philosophy to mixing demonstrations to modern music analyzation to marketing yourself as an artist at UC Riverside.


If you're interested, we have a Meet and Greet Zoom meeting on the July 29th from 6-7pm. You can DM me for more details OR you can fill out this signup sheet https://forms.gle/x74WgbJK1o5WUH7H6 so that we can reach out to you.

3889,Any advice for someone going into CS010B (CS012) with no previous c++ experience,10,2020-07-21 02:31:38,42,"Basically, I took AP Computer Science A 2 years ago and got a 4 on the exam. This allows me to skip CS010A in the fall and move onto CS010B right away. The issue is that exam and the entire class was all Java, no c++/C at all and it was also two years ago. I‚Äôm a bit worried because from what I‚Äôve seen the class is somewhat difficult, and the course description literally says c++/c experience as a prerequisite.

At orientation I brought this up to advisers and they told me to take CS010B anyway because I already have credit for CS010A so there‚Äôs no point in taking the class, which I understand but I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll be lost.

Over the past week, however, I‚Äôve been trying to teach myself C++ from random YouTube tutorials as well as practice websites with random prompts, but does anyone have any advice on what to focus on? So far it seems that at least the basics are conceptually the same as Java with a little bit different syntax but I don‚Äôt know what exactly to study as I don‚Äôt know the syllabus of CS010A.

3891,Hybrid Status for the entire 20/21 school year?,2,2020-07-21 10:05:52,14,"To say Winter quarter will be in person is the equivalent of ""COVID will be controlled and all 20k+ students can share the campus space again without unreasonable risk to the safety of the campus community in 5 months time"". Also, most if not all students will be indirectly mandated to come back to campus due to lack of online classes required for adequate degree progress""

The problem here is that you are going back to campus regardless of personal evaluation of risk associated with the pandemic and, from Congresses point of view, without the ability to  seek liability settlements associated with improper handling of the Pandemic response. (aka, you get sick, were all sorry but no lawsuit: *Your life*  is in *your hands* regarding *your response* to the pandemic)

Lets say winter quarter is in person. It is in my opinion, the UC's will have accommodations for the families of students who don't think its safe just because the UC's said so.

Unless, the UC's can say ""well, we have a mandatory immunization for COVID as well as the other diseases, so the threat is no longer prevalent in the campus community"" then I believe there will be at minimum some Hybrid option for those students who request it. But the concern here is will the opening of the campus be cost effective if, say, half the student population said, ""well, ill just take the hybrid option and sit on the beach somewhere with a hotspot""? Judging from the Housing email we received some time ago, we already know at least UCR is short of money. The reasonable play here is a win-win for Wilcox, save money and stay safe with the online option all year. Which leaves the students who feed on the electricity of the campus environment out on value for their buck.

Overall, in my opinion, if we have no vaccine, there will be at minimum a hybrid class option. The hybrid option may be a waste financially for UCR, in which case, Wilcox will probably take the reasonable route and stay fully online until we get a vaccine to add in with the other required for enrollment.

A broad announcement that this will happen will immediately call for reduction in tuition. It will be  obvious that it needs to happen which is why they probably haven't made the announcement yet. Stringing along, one quarter at a time, unless we start making request for hybrid above. Then we all go online and tuition reduced. I wager this will happen if we make the request now! Funny thing, I think the request is already going to happen anyway. See what im talking about? But without the tuition reduction. 

Just my two cents.

3922,Prospective high school student for fall of 2021!,5,2020-07-22 01:09:11,5,"    

Hellooo, I'm an incoming high school senior and I'm about to start applying to colleges in the fall. It's already stressing me out just researching all the different potential college pathways, especially which college and major to choose. I mostly narrowed it down to four UCs and a potential three other CSUs (I'm from Sacramento, btw). UCR is one of my top choices (tied with Irvine) and I'm planning to as a History major. I've probably only done surface level researching and I wanted to know how strong the CHASS department is. What are the pros and cons of the CHASS department? 

Truthfully, the more practical reason why I want to choose UCR is because of the financial add offerings. I've heard that UCR, compared to the other UCs, is more gracious with fasfa and scholarships and cover a lot more. I'm a first-generation student coming from a low-income family and I will be the second person in my family to go to college (my sister was the first). I really want to go straight into a four-year university, but I'm not opposed to going to a CC and then transferring if I have to in the end. Which is why I also wanted to know from transfer students, how the process was like?  

Also, if anyone has any college app tips or even transfer student tips that would be so amazing !!! (also i'm so sorry if i overshared too much)",0.17933760683760686,0.5363675213675213,riverside

Since I am moving, my parents have told me that they want help paying for utility bills (I don‚Äôt mind) at our new home since they aren‚Äôt working bc if covid. I took that into account and the fact that I‚Äôll be eventually be driving from a farther place twice the distance from where my old home was (more gas $$$) I kind of want to keep it as ‚Äúoff-campus‚Äù because of this but I am deathly afraid of getting in trouble?? My dilemma is that I don‚Äôt know if I should submit a revision and put with ‚Äúwith parents‚Äù or let it be? Has anyone ever been in this situation and not changed it at all? Do they ask for verification? Any advice? Should I just relax??? AHHH. Any advice I‚Äôd appreciated, thanks in advance )‚Äô:",0.16233766233766236,0.36818181818181817,riverside

However, what I can‚Äôt seem to understand is their lag on response to our emails. I wouldn‚Äôt be this upset at the financial aid office if they just suddenly started getting bad at their jobs. 

WHEN CAMPUS WAS STILL OPEN...
did you have to constantly go to the financial aid office because each one of the front desk receptionist gave you the wrong information? 
did you have to resubmit documents or submit the wrong document because they gave you improper instructions and then pinned it on you when you did everything THEY told you to do? 
did you have to be REALLY patient and control your anger with the front desk FA receptionist/ counselor bc this was your fifth time back at the HOSS? 

SO WHO ELSE IS FED UP WITH FINANCIAL AID OFFICE? 

It doesn‚Äôt make sense to me for the financial aid counselors to be bad at replying and actually reading through our emails when they are literally at home, getting paid to do this. I know the system probably changed, getting updated, or something is happening with the financial aid according to the current situation of the world. But this doesn‚Äôt give them an excuse to give us less aid then we did last year or just f*** us over. We depend on the aid to get the education we worked hard in high school to get and the for the future we want. 

I truly think that the people working for the financial aid office are not good at their jobs and I believe we need to have an input on their service much like the evaluations we give to our professors and TAs. We can‚Äôt just let them slide when they‚Äôre inadequate at their jobs especially since this has to do with OUR financial aid which will impact OUR future, not theirs. We need to do something about this. 
I tried to find the email to the director of the financial aid office since it would not help those of us who still need to solve out aid issue by bombarding the finaid@ucr.edu email with complaints. Unfortunately, I couldn‚Äôt find the email to the director. If any of you out there with FBI level stalking skills, then please drop it in the discussion. We need to let them know their employees are not being properly trained and the student always get the short end of the stick due to this.",-0.10382275132275129,0.3053439153439153,riverside

4150,An OOS pre-med intended rising senior,1,2020-08-03 16:47:00,5,"Hi Guys,

I'm a rising senior from Houston, Texas, hoping to be a premed. After talking to a few friends from CA, they mentioned they knew many freshmen who considered going to UCR as opposed to schools like Cal SD and LA, since UCR had a med school and a guarunteed medical school pathway. I was wondering if anyone had any more info on that and how competetive that is?

Besides that, just a few more general questions about the premed experience at UCR.

1. Are people in premed collaborative or cut-throat? 
2. How's the grading culture. Some of the other schools I'm applying to are notorious for having top departments and giving horrid grades. (UIUC UWSeattle, UT, UCSD, LA etc.). I'm looking forward to having a decent premed life, and wanna get high grades. Is that possible here?
3. Are there any scholarships for full rides or the such at UCR for OOS residents?
4. How are pre-med apps from UCR viewed by med schools? Where do graduates usually go for med school? Would an app from UT, UW, UCSD, be viewed as generally more competetive, or is UCR at the level where it  doesn't matter where you go?
5. Are there any med school acceptance stats, can I see where ppl get in and go, and how many do?
6. How would you describe UCR Students??

I have pretty good stats, 3.95 GPA, 1490 SAT, so I'd love to attend if i get merit money, since I heard great things abt premed, but can't justify cost here over UT, TAMU, UTD etc. Really wanna get out of TX though.

4155,Stay or leave?,1,2020-08-03 20:13:12,11,"Hello people of Reddit, I'm in a dilemma and I thought what better place to turn to than our own UCR community.

Although this will be my first year this fall (pre-business pathway @ CHASS), AP credits means I have sophomore standing. By this spring, I'll should be in a position to apply to the Business School.

However, I also am considering trying to transfer to a more prestigious undergraduate business school. The main reason I am considering transferring is for job placement, but after talking to some alumni turns out that the big recruiters actually DO come to UCR for recruitment events (I want to go into  consulting- haven't figured out if I want to do management or financial. Might try to go into banking as well, just not sure yet). I was under the impression that firms such as PWC/ Deloitte/ McKinsey etc. wouldn't notice UCR but after talking to a few people I've found out that's a misconception. Anyways, here's what I have so far-

Reasons to stay at UCR:

1. Can graduate in 3 years (save tons of $- both from not paying full tuition/housing cost this year and graduating in 3 instead of 4)
2. Should be easier to stand out/ maintain higher GPA at UCR in comparison to a top undergraduate business school (for example Haas or Marshall- harder classes/more competition)
3.  Good recruitment (?) at UCR as well (yes, I have heard that it comes down to how many recruitment events you go to/ what you put in)

&amp;#x200B;

Reasons I might want to transfer:

&amp;#x200B;

1. More prestigious school with better ranking = even better networking opportunities for my future  
 
2. A degree from a top 10 undergraduate program could be better when I go to pursue my MBA (fully intend on doing an MBA, but I've heard that school doesn't matter as much as GPA/GMAT for MBA programs)  
 
3. From the data I've seen, at a higher ranked school the average salary out of college/signing bonus seems to be an advantage   
 
4. Because of remote learning, I won't have any connection to the school/ anything holding me back from transferring  
 

I'm still confused; I know a lot of you might think I'm considering all of this too early but if I want to transfer, I have to do it this year as I'll have to apply to UCR's business school by the end of this year.

ANY AND ALL advice from seniors/juniors/alumni is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance !",0.19276094276094272,0.40361952861952854,riverside

Water and gas are included in the rent, but utilities is separate but split between you and your housemates. The room will come with a loft, mattress, and desk for free (you can keep it or sell the furniture at your will after moving in). Two pools are available 24/7 at this complex. Laundry and parking is also available on the premises.

4221,"The Unflattering Truth About UCR ""Honors""",1,2020-08-07 23:50:10,58,"After having spent a year in Honors, this is my ultimate opinion on the program.

No, Honors in NOT worth it if:

1. You are NOT a CHASS Major
2. You took a lot of AP classes in High School or CC courses that got rid of most of your lower division requirements.
3. You hate half-baked beauracracies that lie and don't care about their students.

I was in honors, and I dropped it because it was a poorly-run dumpster fire of a program. Hell, I even had an honors class with the director, Dr. Cardullo! He's a white biology professor who ""taught"" me a History course on oppressed minorities lmao! When I asked what qualified him to teach a college-level Hisotry class, he didn't have an answer. Half the time he wasn't even there to teach us either lol, having secretaries from the Honors office in Skye teach us in his place. The other ""Honors"" professors didn't fair much better. What a joke!

I knew people who had taken classes that got rid of a degree requirement, but honors forced them to take it again in an ""honors"" version that was no different than the regular one!

When they tell you that you will have smaller, more ""intimate"" classes with your professors, they are flat out lying through their teeth at you. 80-90% of ""Honors"" required courses are giant lecture Halls filled with 400 ""Honors"" students who went to High Schools' with grade inflation just like I did, lmao. They are virtually no different than the average UCR student, believe me. Some made me scratch my head as to *why* they were in College in the first place, let alone a supposed ""Honors College.""

It's your choice to stay in that program, but you run the risk of it delaying your graduation due to the mandated Honors ""filler"" courses. This is *especially* true if you are a CNAS or BCOE Major who doesn't need the REQUIRED Humanities Honors classes.

Also, LIVE OFF CAMPUS. Honors REQUIRED me to live in a cramped Pentland dorm with three other people for double the price of apartments around the school. IT. IS. A. SCAM. Your quality of living will be WAY higher and cheaper a couple of blocks away from campus.

As for the capstone project; you can do it even if you are not in Honors. You can even take an Honors class if you are not in Honors, you just have to ask the professor for permission first. ""Honors Programs"" were often glorified office parties with other UCR students who you don't care about or who don't care about you. It ain't as exclusive as they make it seem in the pamphlets.

Proceed with caution, and don't be surprised when people leave the program at the end of the year because of how badly disappointing it is.",0.10877651515151518,0.5178814102564102,riverside

I got a hold of the data and ran my own analysis, which is consistent with the data in the site linked above. **Here are some things that are not so easily apparent on the site I linked:**

1. The average Construction Engineering Technologies major at CSU Northridge makes more money than the averages for ALL reported UCR undergrad majors, including Computer Engineering. This is interesting given the stigma in academics on blue-collar-sounding work, and proves that you should go for what you like to do and what makes practical sense.
2. **BUSINESS**, UCR's most enrolled-in major, on average makes $35700/year after graduation. Note that this only includes employed grads.
3. UCR's **top 5 earning majors** are Computer Eng, Electrical Eng, Mechanical Eng, Chemical Eng, and BioMed Eng in that order. However, it's important to note that Computer Science's wages were suppressed from the public.
4. It's important to note that at most CSUs and UCs, **nursing is the highest earning major** after graduation. UCR doesn't have any data on a nursing major.
5. This data is only looking at how people were doing a year or two after graduating.
6. This data does not take into account people who decided to continue their education full-time.
7. Although the data for many majors was suppressed, the government reports that the non-suppressed data makes up for around 85% of all undergrads, so this is still useful.",0.1850961538461538,0.5217948717948718,riverside

4241,The Bannockburn Horror Stories Compendium,1,2020-08-09 11:27:20,15,"So I have a riddle for all of you Highlanders:

Q: What do you get when you combine asbestos-riddled Public Housing with abandoned Youth Camp Bungalows? 

A: Bannockburn Village!

Jokes aside, of which‚Äîbelieve me‚Äîthere are many, what the hell UCR? Why does this plywood safety hazard held together by black mold and rotting Elmer's Glue still exist as an option for students to live in at UCRüòÖ? 

I thought I'd give ya'll two horror stories from my interactions with the building complex and its associated inhabitants. Feel free to add your experiences below, the crazier the better.

1. The chick from Kenya.

During my freshman year at UCR, I enrolled in a French class in order to get rid of my language requirement. In the class, I met a sweet international student from Kenya that I collaborated with on many of my French language assignments. 

During one random afternoon I asked her where she was dorming/living, and she responded with Bannockburn Village. I asked what her experience was with the complex, and this is how she responded; enjoy:

""I grew up in *rural* Kenya. Through hard work and studying, I was able to leave my rural village there in order to come to the states to earn a college degree from UCR in the hopes of improving my living circumstances.

At no point in my time growing up in my rural village in Kenya, did I have to deal with amount of roaches, rodents, and flooding that I have recently dealt with while living in Bannockburn Village.

I don't use the water from the sinks in Bannockburn because of how discolored it looks. I purchase a pack of water bottles every week just to use it to brunch my teeth and wash my hands.

The walls are so thin that I only spend a maximum of four nights a week sleeping there; during the last three nights I drive to my friends parent's home just to be able to recuperate on lost sleep.

I went to the Bannockburn Village RA's and told them I was from Kenya and that they needed to tear down the building complex because it was a health hazard. They dismissed me without a semblance of empathy for what I was experiencing in that run-down tenement complex.""

When she told me that I was in utter shock. I knew it was bad, *but* *that* *bad?*

2. My Girlfriend moves into Bannockburn Village to save money.

I was assisting my girlfriend on her move-in-day, and I got to experience the glory that was the infamous ""Bannockburn Village."" 

I remember it as though it were yesterday. The chipped and peeling faded-blue paint, the walkways held up by random plywood stilts, the warning signs to not mess with the asbestos-laced walls.

First red flag: no elevators. To get to my girlfriend's room, we had to carry the trolley-carts up flights of stairs in order to get her luggage and belongings to her room.

Second red flag: inside her apartment there was no ceiling light. It was also extremely dark and musky due to the angle of the windows.

Third red flag: no internet. You need to purchase your own wi-fi router+provider even though the campus has free wifi and it's right next to Bannockburn.

Forth red-flag: the mold. The bathroom ceiling was *cached* in mold.

Fifth red flag: the bedrooms. She was living in a double with her roommate, only to have to negotiate who got to have the one small rickety wardrobe in the corner. The door to the room also did not properly fit the frame of the doorway, leaving gaping cracks above and below it. If I remember correctly, there is also no dishwasher in the apartment.

Sixth red flag: the infrastrucure. Many of the lights were broken, hanging by their electrical chords. Plywood stilts held up the disintegrating wooden walkways, and the buildings in the back of the complex looked as though they haven't been repainted in decades. 

Seventh red flag: the surroundings. Two brush fires next to Bannockburn in under a year? At this rate the next one will burn down one of the buildings. Also, the bus stop in front has seedy characters hanging out there on the regular. I've been harassed numerous times by the homeless, and therefore do not let my girlfriend walk to her room alone. 

Anyways, I hope you enjoyed my stories. Please upvote this and leave a comment about your experiences or what you've heard about the complex in general.",-0.0034038626429930777,0.3567451469625382,riverside

Is the UCR a ghost town currently? I'd hate to move in to a ghost town.  


2) My housing placement was in falkirk's studio, and wanted an unbiased review of what it's like. The youtube tours are many years old, and it would be great if someone has more recent feedback of what it's like to live there. I also heard that the balconies are locked, which is terrible (anyone experience overheating or ventilation issues?   


3) I can deal with small bugs and ants, but is it true that Falkirk has mice? I absolutely cannot stand mice and cockroaches and wanted to know if this is an issue in Falkirk. It's too late for me to withdraw my deposit, but it's nice to know what I'm getting into

* You have to come pick it up yourself (I'm up in Mission Grove/Orangecrest area)
* There's a solid size nosebleed stain on it from about a decade ago
   * That side of the mattress is covered by a foam pad that attaches to the mattress, you can have that too
* Honestly despite being old doesn't feel bad, I only replaced it because I wanted a memory-foam one since I'm a side sleeper

Not the kind of thing I could sell, but if you are really in need of a mattress and can't afford one this will do the job just fine. I used to know a couple of people way back when that used camping sleeping pads so I know there's a need.

4337,Accepting Sub and Unsub student loan question. First time using student loans.,1,2020-08-14 23:01:55,3,"Hi everyone,

I'm an incoming transfer student and I have a question regarding Federal Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford loans. I am not sure if I will need the loan money since I am still living at home (and who knows about the winter and spring quarters) so I'm not sure if accepting it would cause any issues if I don't use it at all. If I accept the loans for their full amount, will I be responsible for repaying them right away and any interest even if I don't use any money? I guess a different way to put it would be: Is the full amount given to me and then I'm responsible for that full amount or is the full amount simply accessible to me and I only take what I need and then I'm responsible for the amount that I took? Would it be an issue if I accept the loans but I don't use them at all for the entire school year?

I'm just not sure if I should accept them since it's the first time I actually need student loans for school (because I came from a community college and I didn't need them there) but I'm staying home due to covid. I also don't want to miss any deadlines.

4373,A few questions,1,2020-08-17 20:05:00,17,"1.) I am a bit confused about USHIP, I know that people can waive it if they have health insurance. I am unsure if I want to waive it because I have USHIP fee grant ($1,823), and I think it covers the USHIP fee. Should I still waive it? If not, what benefit does it provide? 

2.) I am dorming at East Lothian and I will be living alone in a double room, I was wondering if I am able to allow another person to live in the room?

My name is Richard and I am a UCR alumni.

I‚Äôm part of a company called MyCampusMate and we created an app for UCR called¬† \*\*RMate\*\* ¬†üéâ (We thought this University needed one)!

We have developed features that we would have loved when we were a students, like a class schedule (it was very annoying to either take a picture of my schedule or log in UCR portal every time with the double factor authentication), a list of events happening at UCR etc.

We just created a (twitter-like) Social Feed to make it easier to communicate with UCR people during this whole online schooling thing.

&amp;#x200B;

We would appreciate any feedback on current or additional feature that you think the app should have¬†üòä¬†(either for now or when classes get back to normal).

Currently we are working on a chat for people who are enrolled in the same class, to facilitate easier communication &amp; collaboration between them (e-mail is getting kinda obsolete).

We would also love to connect with admins from UCR clubs to have further discussions for club-specific groups inside the app.

4418,heads-up! pre-med question!,1,2020-08-20 11:05:02,26,"Hello everyone! I hope you guys are doing great even in this hard time! I am just an undeclared CHASS student with a big dream of becoming a medical doctor! I'm dedicated to this field and I already know that I'm going to suffer a lot in school! but it's ok! as long as I can save people and become their good friend at the hardest time in their life, I'm willing to suffer! So, I just finished my first (fall) quarter class registration and for me, I could actually register math 9A because I luckily did well on the MAE! But, I still chose to register pre-calculus and preparation for the general chemistry, I thought I honestly needed more practice on math and science because I really thought I must be humble and learn from the foundation to actually ""learn"" the things that I need to use in medical school and not just pass the class by memorizing and cramping before the test days. Do you guys think this was a smart choice? or maybe too naive? or bringing down one level for the fall quarter can affect my class schedule that is required by medical school? I just wanted to ask my upper-class pre-med students to get some advice and to see if this was the right mindset of pre-med? Because I just really want to be a good doctor to my patients! like not just a doctor, but also their good friend! So, please let me know your opinions and have a great day!",0.2601438492063492,0.46342120181405894,riverside

But regardless I think the argument of this sub represents our school and we need self respect for it to be a bit extreme. 

I understand this is a sub-reddit dedicated to UCR and all things UCR but this in the end this is a forum for people to communicate, talk, joke, express themselves and their opinions and concerns, and be creative. To my knowledge this sub isn't even an officially run sub by the school or the UC system as a whole so I mean who are we trying to impress, we post memes here for crying out loud lol. By again this is my opinion and I do understand this is a forum used by prospective students, current students, maybe faculty(unofficially of course), and anyone who is just interested in our school or likes it.  The picture does not take away from the valuable information, important questions, insightful answers, and discussion that occurs here on a regular basis. Besides most people are here for to either share information or ask for it, so I doubt the picture will change the subject and matter of it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why don‚Äôt we have an actual school statue that garners respect for our school.**

All of the other UCs (even most universities) either have beautiful artistic statues or revering historic statues that radiate a sense of school pride and spirit. UCR, on the other hand, literally has neither. Instead we have a cracked out Scotty sitting on a bench which looks like it belongs in a local children's  amusement park, and some yellow signs that state a cliche statement costing the school $1 million. I‚Äôm not just shitting on the school, I really like UCR and respect the institution. The statues bother me because they reflect the negative perspective many students have coming to UCR or of those who don‚Äôt go here. The only thing that the current statue does is perpetuate this lack of pride many UCR, and non-UCR students, have or feel when they first get to the school. UCI has a comparable ‚Äúfun‚Äù statue, but they also have a legitimate anteater statue which radiates history. This history is what UCR lacks, or rather a sense of pride in our history. Many students gain this respect for UCR, and realize that it is much better than painted to be, after being here for a while; we should have a school atmosphere reflecting this feeling. A statue should be a symbol of school pride. I know that many UCR students, such as myself, have come to love this school and have gained this pride; and we simply wish more of our peers expressed it. A solution would be to remove the current statue and have the students vote on a new, respectable design; or keep it like UCI does and also add a new one on campus. 

Nothing against those who like the current statue, it‚Äôs cute. However, it is imperative to the sense of pride which has been stagnated for so long here at UCR that we create a statue that garners respect for our institution.

This is coming from someone who wasn't stoked about the icon change. Quit being fucking sheep. @ all you pre-frosh high school students. All universities are primarily businesses dedicated to pumping out workers and you should have no allegiance to anybody. If people like Gates spent all their time in school dick-sucking the brand they would not have dropped out and invented something new. Your obsession with the rankings is a symptom of the system feeding you advertisements to brainwash you into spending your money at their institutions by capitalizing off your insecurities as young adults. Be fucking grateful that you have the opportunity to study at an American institution and aren't starving like children in third-world countries. Millions of people don't have the opportunity to get a bachelors degree which is statistically speaking the best way to create a better life for themselves. And here you are in school wasting your time worrying about rankings. Spot wasting your time on that shit and take advantage of your privilege and resources given to you and use them to level up as an individual and create a better world for people around you.

Yes, at the end of the day rankings/prestige can dictate your career trajectory but does that really matter? Do you want some free hand-out job given to ivy leaguers so that you can buy a house in the suburbs and wither away in a soulless company as a cog?

I'll let you in on a little secret. To be successful at anything it comes down to pure grit and ambition. I've worked alongside people who have gotten their educations at UC Berkeley, Cornell, Columbia, and Stanford and their is no difference between us. As a matter of fact our similarities and ambition is what brought us together. Find what drives you and use that drive to manifest a reality you desire.

But looking back at it I am also sad to receive this diploma because I will miss UCR from the professors who helped me, to the classmates and friends who I would see on a regular basis, and the campus itself. 

On top of all of this we managed to continue strong and keep our heads with a global pandemic changing what we perceived our senior year to be like. Overall I hold the experiences of UCR close to my heart and will cherish them for the rest of my life, I hope you can all say the same and hopefully we can add one more to the UCR experience whenever our in person graduation is finally held. 

I wish everyone in this class the best of luck on the next steps of their lives and that everyone one of us is proud to be a UCR and Highlander Alumni even if this was just one step in your academic journey like me.

[http://fpa.ucr.acsitefactory.com/sites/g/files/rcwecm556/files/2020-08/BAC%20Recommendation%20to%20Chancellor.pdf](http://fpa.ucr.acsitefactory.com/sites/g/files/rcwecm556/files/2020-08/BAC%20Recommendation%20to%20Chancellor.pdf)  


&gt;2.Identify specific strategic areas of focus for targeted permanent reductions.  The BAC reviewed a number of options for consideration, and focused on the following areas.  The recommendation is that these areas should be carefully further evaluated to determine the feasibility of significant reductions/elimination, given the severity of the budget challenges.  Although these are important programs, they are not viewed as critical as other campus activities, especially given the very lean level of funding for UCR (even before the budget reductions).     
&gt;  
&gt;a.Athletics.  Support for a focus on elimination, with perhaps savings some funds for a more robust intramural program for the campus (and address the existing dedicated student fee).

Noticed you guys have a spreadsheet database for class difficulty -- this is information that would be integrated in one of the endpoints.

Is anyone else feeling the same?? Would anyone be down to rent out a big house or apartment for this upcoming year and live in it dorm-style?

In this Instagram post and the article posted, it has been revealed that the Budget Advisory Committee (BAC) recommended to cut the athletics programs from the school all-together. This is a permanent solution to a temporary problem with no positive outcome.  Losing athletics means laying off over 90 staff members and losing over 300 student athletes. Bear in mind that UCR gives up to 9,000+ in sports related scholarships. Most athletes probably couldn‚Äôt even afford going to a four-year university without the scholarships that they have been granted and earned!

I'm an incoming transfer student. My Financial aid for the Fall shows up as Estimated Aid in my Student Account. It is greater than my current balance and my minimum due is $0.00 so I should be receiving a refund eventually. When will it be paid though (because it says estimated aid I'm assuming it hasn't been posted)? The deadline is coming up and I don't want to add a late fee or eventually be dropped from my classes. Or is everything set and done already and now I just have to wait? When would there be any activity if everything is done?

Note: I submitted a revision request to change my housing status from off campus to with parents on August 31st and the request still hasn't been reviewed. I'm not sure if that affects anything.

Now, regarding Highlander Orientation. I attended Highlander Orientation for transfers on August 31st. However, in my MyUCR account at [my.ucr.edu](https://my.ucr.edu) in the Documents section it still says that the Highlander Orientation attendance record has not been received. Is anyone else experiencing the same thing and they are just taking too long to update that requirement on students' portals, or is there something wrong with my orientation attendance?

4817,What are your guy's opinions for going online for the rest of the academic year?,1,2020-09-11 09:11:50,51,"We are not going back in the Spring semester. The CSUs just are online for the rest of their 2020-2021 academic year and I'm 99.99% sure the UCs are going to follow suit. It doesn't make sense to go back to campus after the Flu season and the second coming of the Big 'Rona.

How do you guys feel about that? I honestly don't care since I'm a freshman and I'm doing my GE classes and other basic classes. It sucks for juniors and seniors though.

Please do not refer to Berkeley as ‚Äú#2 Public University.‚Äù This is not the proper way to refer to the University of California's original and flagship campus. #1, The Best, or The GOAT are all proper and acceptable ways to say it. #2, on the other hand, is not.

As the system's most prestigious and respected campus, we feel that it is important to honor and maintain an appropriate level of respect for our university's ranking. We feel that ""#2"" 
cheapens our brand and doesn't emphasize the incredible prestige associated with Berkeley.

While it may be acceptable to refer to all other UC campuses in lower ranks due to their lack of recognition and prestige, this is not acceptable for the flagship and most well-known 
campus, and we therefore request that you cease using the name ""#2"" to refer to our school. 

Thank you.

"" Haha UCR is better than you now and you're tied with Merced.  ""

"" Harder to get in on average by less than 5%? Who cares. You slugs are just salty that you're finally dead last with Merced. UCR will be nice and cozy where you used to be at the #7 best UC spot.""

As someone looking from an outside perspective, this behavior is just depressing, and you deserve to be called out, because 4 years from now (I'm guessing you are a freshmen), none of this will matter. I'm all for being prideful and happy over your university, but come on, online college RANKINGS mean this much in your life?

Lets get this straight: A media company that posts opinion based articles, recently ranked colleges a certain way, so that some fluctuation occurred from last years ranking. Not only is this pretty trivial (Really? Are you going to let one website which posts college rankings make yourself feel validated or happy? You really just exposed that a college ranking has that much power that it was **hurting you so deep inside** that the fact you moved up a few spots is **the best thing in the entire world**, enough for you to start flaming on other colleges and boasting/celebrating your rise. **That's sad.**), but it's also downright stupid to objectively say a college is worse than another from such a small difference in spots.  

A top 30 college vs a top 40 college literally makes no difference in the world. When you apply for a job, no one is going to say oh shoot, your college is a few spots lower, you are rejected. Once you get passed like top 50 or top 100 maybe it can start to mean something, but arguing over literal spots on a list is so damn irrelevant. They are all good schools. Get your degree, move on from your life, and use it. 

As a UC system I think it would be beneficial to rid this behavior and leave it UCB to be the competitive assholes. I'm glad UCR is moving up but you shouldn't reflect UC Riverside's community buffetboy123 by shouting down other colleges and hyping up such an irrelevant list to people that are already in college (Sure, it can be useful I guess when applying, but we're all here, we all want to graduate and do well, what benefit does this bring?).",0.17054798571192012,0.5025205213729804,riverside

My sister applied way back when and got admitted with financial aid for being low income. That's all fine and dandy but the problem we seem to be facing now is that for whatever reason the admissions board filed her residency status as an out of state resident of California. She provided the necessary documentation to prove that she's a resident and has practically lived in the state the entirety of her life but the board isn't having any of it and just told us she's going to be paying an amount that we can't possibly pay and she's going to end up having to drop her classes for the semester if we can't pay the amount. She's had the balance on her account for a while now and she's reached out to everyone she could with little to no response at all the second she saw there was an issue about 3 weeks to a month ago. I don't think it's fair for her to even consider getting a student loan if the negligence wasn't on her behalf but instead from the admissions themselves especially if the admissions won't even consider fixing their mistake.

My sister has been an exceptional student and has worked hard day in and day out like many of you have, trying to do the best she can to do everything she can to succeed and have a bright future. She's currently panicking and having a breakdown because she knows that attending UCR might not be a thing for her at all now and she's gonna get set [back](https://back.My).

My question is has anyone encountered something like this? How was it resolved? I understand that COVID has probably made it crazy in admissions but I feel like this is grossly negligent on their part. What can we do? Any advice helps.",0.15246212121212122,0.5166666666666667,riverside

I'll try to get on the phone with them ASAP to know what's going on, but usually, don't they wait to see the check's time stamp to see if someone missed the deadline or not?

In addition, they return any checks not adding up to the total amount with another -25 fee, so am I expected a 125 fee here? Can I void that check and try a bank transfer instead? I'm quite lost here.

4960,"Corona Conversation, College Experience, Life Goals?",1,2020-09-17 07:30:23,9,"What¬¥s Up Highlanders?

This is going to be a long post, lmao, so if you read it all, thanks! 

Hey so, I didn‚Äôt get a chance to post this the other day, but I wanted to ask you all how you are doing. I know Covid continues to ruin pretty much everything, but hopefully it goes away soon, ideally before the new year. Don¬¥t want to start the new year with Covid crap. I don¬¥t know if a stimulus pack will come out soon, cuz we all know everyone needs it, but then we would face another major issue following that stimulus lol, a chat for later. Anyway, I wanted to open up this discussion to see how everyone is feeling and their thoughts on their college experience so far. Like what were you hoping to do, or accomplish, or experience while at college? What did you look forward to before Covid hit? I will share my thoughts too. I feel pretty lousy about everything, not motivated to do well in school, so took an academic break, been working full-time but haven¬¥t really done much with my life so far. Just saving up money, and I feel so empty. This is life we are living right now, history even, and yet, I feel like I am wasting away, and I want to be doing other things. I want to be at home, chill and relax, play video games all day, sleep, hang out with friends, go out to eat, travel, have a bunch of pets that I can spoil and take care of, work is whatever, but I literally feel the days passing me by each morning when I get up, and even the gym isn¬¥t fulfilling. I think there¬¥s something wrong with me...is what I would say, but I know that is not true. We are all facing similar issues, and it¬¥s not us, its everything else. Liking having to afford school which costs 10x as much as thirty years ago, except income has nearly become stagnant, and so how do they expect us to afford school, if we cant afford to live normally, eat, take care of ourselves, and other things when the economy is so messed up and minimum wage full-time still keeps you under the national poverty line. This is all so stupid. We are trapped. Not only in our homes but in our own minds, and lack of expression builds tension and stress. I feel like I¬¥m losing my mind sometimes, where everything around me seems so fake, surreal, and I am just existing in time and space. Things need to change. I feel like I¬¥m frozen in time and building up an intense breakdown lol, like I¬¥m gonna snap one of these days. This is not healthy, we are not ok. I am tired of feeling so empty. What purpose do we serve, or will we serve? I am not going to go down that philosophy rabbit hole of a mess, but damn, this sucks. I wanted to meet people, make friends, fall in love, and make the most of my experience in college, but nah, here I am just slowly dissolving into the nothingness of society. I want to be something in this life, do something with my life. Take care of someone who will do the same for me, and so much more. I won¬¥t get all into it, but I think a big part of life is finding your other half. I think back on freshman year and remember my relationships, and wish I could have connected with them more. I am still learning about myself and realize that reflecting on the past brings up a lot of stuff I want to explore or discover now, and yet, we can¬¥t go back to the past and change anything. That¬¥s fine, but I hate realizing things now when I should have realized it back then. Self discovery may be a process, but i think its better when you have someone with you, or supporting you. I just wish, things could be different. Nobody really does study sessions anymore, hanging out with people almost impossible with corona and school anyway, and the chances of meeting interesting people to spend more time with is nonexistent. I know there‚Äôs time for relationships after college, but that really sucks and hardly anyone finds the opportunity because you‚Äôre so busy working or doing other things that your love life kinda disappears, at least thats what ive seen and heard from others who have already graduated or moved back home, or a couple years out of school already. I am not in any rush, but we are young, and I feel like I¬¥ve been ready to settle down for a long time now, it¬¥s just a matter of bumping into the right person or fate bringing us together, something along those lines lol. I dont know about everyone else, but love is a big part of my life, well, its value I mean. Anyway, moving on. I am pretty bummed out about college life being pretty much dead. Socializing is like being in grade school and trying to make friends on the playground during recess, except, there is no recess and were all stuck in class, but sitting behind computers back home lol, what the hell. I hope Covid goes away soon, so we can all return to having a normal, pleasant college life experience. Anyway...

More to talk about? What are your life goals? Like who here has plans? Where are all the jobs at right now? Space Force? Engineers? Medical? What do you want from life? Retire young? Be a trophy spouse? Travel for work? Ugh this is depressing...lol Also, just curious, who might want to network in the future? Whether it deals with employment, or offering help via whatever services we provide through our occupations, I am looking for people who stand out. Does anyone here want to change the world? What about rule? If you could, would you take over the world? Not necessarily world domination, but along the lines of changing things for the better. If computer science majors, aka hackers, could hack the matrix, exploit some glitches, you would probably take over the world lol do you think this universe was created as an intelligence design? I am thinking about buying a whole lot of land, and building my own city, you could say. Basically a large enough area that could house dozens of people, but self sustaining, similar to what you would find in watching shows like the walking dead. Basically have land for agriculture, live off the grid, green energy, ready for DDay lol, this will take years to develop, but with the right people in your network, anything can be done with planning. I think i would rather live away from everyone else, just have a nice community of family, friends, and other people i like, living on a large piece of land, taking care of ourselves, without depending or relying on the government or outside influence. Not that i wouldnt go out often to travel or do things in the city lol, but I want a nice peaceful life and create a place for the future generations to have no worries if things do downhill in the coming years. We¬¥ll see, i dont know if i even want kids lol, but yeah, definitely want my own paradise, so if anyone here is like minded or thinks about similar things, Hmu, im down to stay in contact and see whats up, like who¬¥s gonna be a doctor, veterinary, dentist, engineer, lawyer, architect, etc, all kinds of occupations that have great power in networking. Feel free to Hmu if you¬¥re just curious about stuff or wanna chat about interesting things or whatever. I¬¥m down to talk about anything. Lol, this was a really long post, so, if you managed to read it all, thanks! Leave a comment, some feedback and thoughts, i don¬¥t expect much, but for those that do have something to say, i automatically already know that you are a little different from everyone else on here, so congrats! Maybe I will run into you on campus one day, or something and I can help you out, i like helping others so, dont hesitate to ask or say anything. I am sure something will come up later in life and you will return the favor. Trying to be optimistic lol, its hard being positive.

Hey, everyone!

It's late, but inbetween a game of *Among Us* I wanted to speak on the upcoming quarter and what this means in a current state of the university, the United States, and how to succeed in class. To start, I'm a Ph.D. student in CHASS researching Film and Disability. I graduate from UCR with my BA before returning to pursue a career.

At this moment, it seems like things might not change for another year, at the most. As winter draws closer, we may find the flu adding anxiety to most, if not our current structures and support systems. While this is stressful by all means and accounts (let alone during a political climate ignorant of current social issues), attending school online can still be a way to earn credit and succeed depending on the decisions you make here on out.

No, not talking about masks, although those are very important. More importantly, however, are some tips I've collected from teaching the summer and spring.

**1.** **If possible, make it a goal to introduce yourself to your instructor, TA, and class.**

* Yes, we know--socialization is key to success in college, particularly because of how much our work is tied with communication. On the other hand, your instructors, TAs, and classmates are the support you will need to succeed. Miss an assignment explanation? You have someone to go to. Need to hear said assignment put a different way? Same goes for that, too. Feeling lost in the reading, or not sure where to start? Your instructors and peers can surely be of use to you as you work together, struggle over the same material, and try to go your own paths.

**2. Prioritize, prioritize, prioritize.**

* Because of the way that Covid, politics, and antiblack violence has sapped all energy from us this last year, it's going to be hard to find a routine if you haven't had one all summer. A week before classes start, try and get your sleep schedule together if you have a class or work in the morning. If not, maybe use the morning as a way to do yoga, study, or have coffee while catching up before lecture. If you live at home (like I do), try building a schedule that you can post above your work space, so that you and your family can see when classes, appointments, and homework matter. These are small steps, but they can also vastly improve your mental state by reminding you of things to accomplish that make the world grow smaller and less heavy.

**3. Make time for office hours...please.**

* Office hours are time for you; they're made for faculty to give advice and actually be normal people. If at all possible, do your best to, yes, introduce yourself, and use these hours to accomplish something. Say, get an assignment explained particularly for you, or have the professor, instructor, explain a concept if you didn't really get it in class. Now, don't feel you have to go if you have nothing to ask, to think about, but these hours helped get me through community college, undergrad, and two+ years of graduate work. Just because they're not mandatory doesn't mean they won't be of any benefit.

**4. When taking notes, get down what you think is critical or key to understanding the concept, material.**

* Ever take notes and try to get everything down, but find yourself lost later on because you got *everything* down? Or, ever try to notate the entire lecture and find yourself stumbling to get everything in? When taking notes, we're trying to collect information that will help us succeed in exams, assignments, most; not everything needs to be noted, but you do need to prioritize (*ah, yes*) and get down what you feel is most crucial to your success. Is the professor explaining afropessimism and the theory of slavery existing in our midst? Maybe take down the definition, and then bullet-point notes on how this works out in various ways. *Now*, does that professor start lecturing about all of the theorists important to afropessimism? You might not need all of them, but you might want to get the main theorist down and look up his/her/their work later on. Same goes for STEM, too: get the fundamentals down so that you can replicate the work (process, ideas, definitions) later on. **Also:** yes, some instructors *do* record lectures, but try not to rely on their videos as a way to review all of the material, because that's *a lot* of work. Taking notes under pressure actually helps us identify what is most important/crucial/imperative to our success, particularly when trying to remember a lecture on, say, a Tuesday (the black hole of the week, pandemic wise...).

  
And there we are: four tips on how to succeed and be a better student this fall quarter. Alas, if your internet cuts out, you miss lecture, or--hopefully not--someone gets sick in your family; you'll need to adjust your plans and preparation to take note of any missed information, lost time, etc. Your faculty might have a reasonable late policy, if not be willing to work with you dependent on the course. Again, reach out to them, get to know them and any TAs. If you do all that you can (these four tips are the minimum, in my opinion), then you'll lessen the risk of failing this quarter, if not raise your opportunities for success.

5076,Help Prospective Students Learn About UCR!,1,2020-09-22 23:01:25,2,"Ay r/UCR~~  Your moderators have graciously granted me permission to tell you about the website that I intern for, so if you‚Äôre interested in helping prospective students learn about Howard from a distance, please stick around.

CollegeVizzy, the aforementioned website, was created several years ago by a moderator and active member of r/ApplyingToCollege who was determined to bridge the gap between colleges and applicants who wanted to visit them, but lacked the ability (for whatever reason).  As you can probably imagine, the onset of the pandemic has created some new urgency to roll out a new-and-improved iteration of the platform.  

So what is CollegeVizzy?  In a nutshell, it‚Äôs a place where college students can make prompted social-media style posts about their college campus¬¨‚Äìand where prospective students can compile and share notes and impressions of universities they‚Äôve visited.  The end result, we hope, will be a resource that provides a somewhat more comprehensive look at a given college than a virtual tour or an Instagram page might otherwise by itself.  And right now, more than probably ever until this point, high school students could use as much information as possible to learn about the schools they like.  

To make this resource a reality, we need a strong content-creating user base.  And that‚Äôs where you guys can help.  If you‚Äôre interested in making an account and sharing ~stuff~ about UCR, the link is below.  Everything is free, there are no ads, we sell no user data, and making a post will enter you into a giveaway that we‚Äôre running for a $150 Uber Eats gift card.     

Tell us anything!  Show us your favorite places on campus, the quietest study spots (actually probably not that), or whatever else you‚Äôd want prospective students to know about.  The use of online photos or screenshots from virtual tours is welcomed¬¨; your personal experience on campus is really all that matters.  If you have any questions about the site or about posting, or any feedback, leave it down below.  I didn‚Äôt want to make this post unbearably long, so if there‚Äôs anything that doesn‚Äôt make sense or isn‚Äôt clear I would be more than happy to follow up in the comments.  Thanks!

5116,UCR HOUSING/COMMUNICATION RANT,1,2020-09-24 13:36:37,2,"I am upset and frustrated with UCR Housing! Initially, I was planning to move into my apartment at Glen Mor at the start of the fall quarter and remain there for the entirety of the academic year. However, on September 4, 2020, UCR sent out an email stating how the on-campus housing policies had changed and that now students were able to postpone their fall move-in until the winter quarter. The email UCR sent also stressed the importance of reconsidering our housing options now that they were offering to save/reserve our housing contract until the winter quarter. 

As a result of that new housing policy, I contemplated my options and finally decided to take their offer and save myself thousands of dollars worth of housing costs. So, I clicked the option that stated, ""NO-Please transfer my payments and contract to winter quarter."" After that, I awaited some kind of confirmation email, housing portal message, or R'Web notification that would confirm my new housing status, but I got nothing. Instead, I received an email on September 12th, 2020, from UCR Housing titled ""Apartment Check-in Information,"" which stated that I was scheduled to move into my apartment on Friday, September 25th, at 8:30 am! And I know that maybe that was a scheduled email, but it threw me way off after deciding that I was planning to stay at home. I mean, how is housing going to send an email giving students an option to stay or move in, and on top of that, send an email informing them that they are scheduled to move in? The worst part is, though, that they did not bother to correct their miscommunication by sending an email saying something along the lines of ""sorry, just disregard the email telling you to move in, and stay at home as you have previously confirmed.""

After that, I was left very confused because I got two contradictory emails, so I called UCR Housing, and no one answered. I was left on hold for minutes and would try again, but still, no one answered. I eventually made up my mind and thought, ""maybe the September 4 email was just a poll or survey but nothing official."" So I decided to pack my things, go shopping for apartment utilities, and make preparations for living on campus. The worst preparation of all, however, was getting a job!!! Because I thought that I would end up moving in on the 25th, I accepted a UCR Dining job offer, attended the job orientation, and did some online job mini-courses, which would end up being for nothing. 

Fast forward to the last week before the quarter started (this week), and I get a notification that there has been a change to my student account and dynamic bill. So I check, and all my fall housing payments show negative numbers, and my balance went from a couple thousand to $0. At first, I was happy because I thought, ""wow, I don't have to get myself into debt anymore,"" but then I realized that maybe that email I got on the 4th did impact my status! So today, one day before move-in, I call UCR Housing at 8:00 am (open time) and was left on hold for 1 hour and 30 minutes! I decided to give up and call a couple of times between 10:00 - 11:00 am until someone finally picked up. Eventually, someone picked up, and it was a nice lady, and she confirms to me that my housing contract was moved to the winter quarter and that I should disregard all the move-in emails they send? I was distraught, and my stress/anxiety level skyrocketed because I was already prepared to move out of my home. I had a secured job on campus and was already scheduled shifts. On top of that, I had spent hundreds of dollars on home utilities! 

I ended up having to call my job manager and let her know that I will not be able to work for them anymore because I do not live in Riverside and that my surprise resignation was out of my control, considering that I had no idea what was going on. I am now going to have to unpack all my things and readjust here at home. Also, I feel awful for having to quit on my manager :(

Overall, I want to say that although I accept that maybe I could have taken better steps to have avoided this problem, it was mostly UCR's fault. I mean, how are they going to send you an email offering a change to your housing status and not even give you a confirmation or communicate that I am set to move into my apartment until winter? And instead, they send emails following fall move-in? All of that miscommunication on their part caused me to change my entire game plan in less than 5 hours since this morning. Please tell me what you all think.

5120,Living On Campus. . .,1,2020-09-24 15:19:29,0,"To those who received the ""Would You Like To Transfer Your Payments To Winter"" survey, I just want to share my experience in case any of you might be on the same boat. I decided to transfer my payments to winter a few weeks ago and still received emails about moving in. I ignored these because I was sure I answered the survey correctly. I checked my Student Account and my charges for housing had turned negative, I think this is a reflection of your choice for the survey. Then my account balance turned to zero. Currently on my dynamic bill, the housing charges are still negative, and when i check the ""Account Information"", my direct deposit refund is posting in the full amount. If you are worried about whether or not to move in tomorrow even though you transferred the payment, check your dynamic bill and account information. It can get a little tricky to find this, but in the same page as ""Student Account Online"" through Student Account on the portal, ""Account Information"" is there. Check that to see if the change has been reflected on your refund.

So, I¬¥ve read up on some of the posts, also thinking back on older ones too, and I gotta say, it sucks right now what you are all dealing with. I decided to put out this Raffle to give out something that can help a couple of you. There will be two winners, possibly three lol, not sure if I end up doing tiers, but rather keep it equal. Anyway, to participate, what I need you to do is...

1. Vote which Option you prefer.
2. Something you like to do, hobbies, interests?
3. Favorite food, color, and any one other thing lol?
4. Favorite creature and why? Animal, insect, magical, mythical, fictional, etc.
5. What is your ¬®Me¬® (one) word that best describes you? You can add three to five adjectives.
6. Inbox me three to five reasons why I should choose you, basically a little background of your situation on what you are dealing with. What¬¥s your story?
7. Tell  me what you current favorite song is. You can tell me more if you want, since I would like to check out more music to listen to. I just need your favorite one to see what your vibe is like, because music describes us, expresses how we are inside. So pick your top song.
8. Tell me what you would do with the gift if you were selected.
9. Tell me No More than three short-term goals and three long-term goals. I would like to know your ambitions. What you aspire to accomplish in life. 
10. Share one interesting thing about yourself.

My selection is based on a wholistic evaluation, which includes character assessment. You do not have to comment on this post. I support anonymity. I will not be announcing the people who are selected, again, this is for anonymity, and you do not need to know who was selected anyway, but I will say in the comments when the selection is over. Please do not inquire or harass anyone involved in this raffle about who won or anything related, that goes against anonymity and is unnecessary. Also, if you are selected, I may check on you later to see how you are doing and potentially offer something again, just to keep rooting for you. I do like to stay up to date with these kind of things. And if you ever feel like talking or would like some advice or you just need someone to just listen, I¬¥ll be glad to do that. I would like to help in any way I can so, please don¬¥t hesitate to reach out to me!

If there are a lot more people who participate than I anticipate, and I do not expect that many people to do all this lol, I will probably do a random drawing of the people I narrow it down to, since it would be hard to decide who needs it more based on the limited info I get. Also, I will probably do this again sometime around the holidays, so, you can look forward to that. Good luck to everyone, and I look forward to helping you out!

5184,Physics 040C Chegg scandal,1,2020-09-27 13:40:03,18,"There's another student on here from my class who posted about the same issue, but I was hoping this thread could help more students in my class come forward if they received the same email. Contrary to the student in the previous post who claims he doesn't even have a Chegg account, I do have a Chegg account linked to my school email, so proving my innocence will probably be more difficult. Here's the exact email for anyone curious. 

""It has come to my attention that you may have been involved in academic conduct related to the final exam for PHYS 040C in Spring Quarter 2020  


Specifically, there is evidence that you used Chegg to obtain answers to the final exam questions.¬† A person identified as you viewed questions on the website that were from the final exam.¬† These questions were unique to the final, and Chegg has provided further information that indicates the questions were viewed by you during the final exam time.¬† Such action constitutes academic misconduct.  


Do you accept responsibility for having done this?¬† A prompt reply is appreciated.  


This case, along with your reply, will be referred to Student Conduct &amp; Academic Integrity Programs. ""

I have since contacted chegg, asking if they released any of my personal information to anyone. They responded with this email

"" If you have been associated with an honor code investigation, you will receive an email from us notifying you that the school has requested information. For further questions, please reach out to the school directly. During an investigation, we are unfortunately unable to provide any additional information. ""

I have received no such email from chegg, but reading around reddit it seems like some students involved in such allegations don't get emails either. 

I have also read information about similar scandals in other universities, except the professors were bluffing to get people to confess.

Here's the thing, I did look up a few questions to see if they'd been posted to Chegg, but from what I remember they weren't answered yet, except one I remember specifically that was answered but I didn't copy it because the answer seemed wrong (as Chegg for physics often is). Obviously, even clicking the link is an honor code violation and I'm aware of this. However, I don't know if the professor is bluffing, in which case I would admit to nothing. 

I just don't really know what to do, I get that I shouldn't have even clicked any links, but seeing questions with no answers and then choosing not to copy another seems not as bad as what many other students do. I know that a misconduct board probably won't care, but I have no other infractions. I have a great GPA and am involved in many extracurriculars. I've never been accused of anything, so I also don't really know what the likely punishment is. With the amount of stress it's caused me in the last two days alone I'd honestly happily retake the class next quarter or in winter, but I don't know if that'd be the extent of the punishment or much worse. 

Anyways, if any of my fellow highlanders are in the same boat, feel free to reach out to me. Also no moral shaming for this please, I know it was wrong but it was a stupid lack of judgement and I didn't really copy anyways. Also the exam was 20 multiple choice questions, so I don't think he got people's info by comparing their answers to a Chegg response.",0.02445987654320989,0.48148148148148145,riverside

5224,I Decided To Rent Textbooks Outside The Student Store,1,2020-09-28 17:20:21,1,"This Is Just My Experience. I decided to get a jump start on the semester by renting the books but was extremely disappointed to find that the Campus Store is offering the books I'm looking for in a paper format only. So I decided to take a leap and look for it outside of what the Campus Store offers and found the eBook version on Pearson. I think I only need two books so far, so I decided to just get them on Pearson in the eText format. This is why I felt the need to make a post. One of the books was available as etext on Pearson, and the other was a subscription. What this basically meant was that the one that was a subscription, would give you a code to redeem on VitalSource. So an entirely different site (which is better than Pearson in my opinion so far), and this meant I would have to go between Pearson and VitalSource. If I would have known this then, I would have just got both on VitalSource, but eh. NOTE: That the etexts DO NOT come with an access code, so I would hold off on jumping the gun until you are SURE, you DON'T need it. VitalSource has a desktop app on Windows which is fairly easy to use and does basic functions like Highlight, Flashcards, Allows you to print two pages at once, and add notes, nothing crazy and definitely not as clunky as Kindle. I honestly like the basic design. The app works well and does what I need it to do, and it beats having to return a physical version(s). Note, that eTexts have a different ISBN so you may have to use the title of the book to find the eText version on the site. On some books, it also has a ""deal"" of getting 4 months of Bartleby for like $20.  Before you take the ""deal"" for Bartleby, make sure it offers the books you are looking for. You can also try Slader with ad-block on (free). GLHF fellow peers",0.09818840579710145,0.5816942719116632,riverside
5225,Why did you move back to campus this quarter?,1,2020-09-28 17:35:11,7,"Hey Highlanders

Im really missing school and bummed out we are remote again.  I was supposed to move back this fall because I secured an undergraduate research position, but since the school has decided to not allow undergraduate research, I am home for another quarter.  My parents especially see no purpose in me moving back if classes and research is online.  But I personally like the vibes of campus and hate to be stuck at home.  

All over UCR Housing's and UCR Residential Life's insta stories, they are posting what seem like a lot of students moving to school for this fall.  For those of you that did move back, what was your reason?  If your parents were against it, what was your excuse? What did your guys' parents think of it, considering most classes are still online?",-0.06500000000000002,0.3,riverside
5226,Campus Apartment Residents: Daily Wellness Survey,1,2020-09-28 18:04:21,0,"So there was another post awhile back about this but it didn't get much traction so I'll try my luck;

I know there's this daily wellness survey that students in living in any of the dorms or Glen-Mor need to fill out and whatnot, but do residents of other campus apartments need to do that as well? 

I feel like Housing has only targeted their messages to new residents and as someone who just resigned their contract from last year, I have no idea if I'm expected to do the same things. 

The website also says that there will be regular (once-twice a week) COVID testing for people on campus but does that apply to everyone living in campus owned properties or just people going onto campus for in-person classes?",0.011136363636363635,0.2698135198135198,riverside

5431,Offering proofreading/editing help,1,2020-10-04 13:42:04,8,"\*Mods, please remove if not allowed!\*

Hi, my name is Katsumi and I‚Äôd like to offer my proofreading/editing services to some fellow UC students!

I graduated summa cum laude from UCLA in 2018 with a B.A. in Psychology and a minor in Gender Studies with a 4.0 GPA, college honors, and highest departmental honors. I also won an award for having the top honors thesis paper among my psych departmental honors cohort. I specialize in academic writing and APA style (7th edition). I scored a 5.0 on the writing portion of the GRE (92% percentile, not that GRE scores are indicative of your success in grad school!). I have experience writing and reviewing manuscripts, personal statements, grants, resumes, CVs, and more! I also like to read in my spare time and I‚Äôve read 350+ books over the past 3 years.

I‚Äôm happy to help provide feedback and proofread essays, personal statements, statements of purpose, application materials, emails, websites, blog posts, etc. Please feel free to PM me or email me at [katsumi.edits@gmail.com](mailto:katsumi.edits@gmail.com) for more information and rates. :)

How do I properly take the quarter off at this point? Do I just drop my classes? I'm honestly not sure if I'll return to UCR next quarter or do CC. Kinda depends on where I'm at in a few months and the situation with Covid. All I know is I definitely need to take this quarter off. 

Other than the $25 fee for the DPP, I haven't paid anything towards tuition. Financial aid covers most of my tuition, so I am a bit concerned about how it will be affected, but regardless I need to take this quarter off and I figure I'll deal with that if/when I return. 

Lastly, I have USHIP. Does anyone know what will happen to my insurance when I'm no longer a fulltime student?

The process was so stressful and time consuming that i thought it was impossible to find another internship. But after a friend introduced me to using this resource, I was honestly shock that it was able to help me land a couple interviews and offers.

RippleMatch uses machine learning and AI to match you with internship and or entry level jobs that matches your qualifications. On top of matching you with many opportunities, they provide free resources to help you navigate your job search. It takes less than 5 mins to set up your profile and its very easy.

This has honestly saved me so much time and made the job searching process less stressful. With school just starting, i just wanted to put this out here if anyone needed it. I highly recommend this resource and I hope y'all will find it useful as much as i did :) [**https://ripplematch.com/index?r=Qv78Km**](https://ripplematch.com/index?r=Qv78Km)",0.21219298245614038,0.48631578947368415,riverside

Hi guys - back in July, I posted a survey about the coronavirus on various college subs. I got almost 500 responses and recently wrote an article summarizing the findings. There were so many excellent responses it was hard to pick which ones to highlight, but I tried my best to capture the trends I observed. Since a good chunk of the responses came from students in this sub, I thought I‚Äôd make an update post (all in all, I‚Äôd say about 25 universities had high levels of representation in the survey, so I‚Äôll be making update posts in those particular subs).  

Thanks so much to the people in this sub who participated! This wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without the help of student redditors. If any of you have questions, feel free to PM me.

During normal circumstances, we hold tennis practices for all levels of players (beginners, intermediate, advanced, and competitive) that are UCR affiliates. In addition to that, we hold various events throughout the year. We also have a competitive tennis team within our club that competes against other schools in USTA SoCal Tennis on Campus Series. All in person activities are on hold right now, but we hope that things will turn around soon! So, If you're interested, please fill out our club interest form. And comment here or message me if you have any questions about our club!

Offer my support and encourage you to overcome your challenges.  If you‚Äôre having a bad day or just wanna have a quick random conversation, feel free to hmu. You can message me on here, or for a more fluid conversation, reach me via iMessage/gmail chat @ YouAreNotMySenpai@gmail.com    maybe you just wanna send something random or have a spontaneous chat about something interesting or ask for advise or feedback in general. you don‚Äôt have to be having a bad day, although i have them quite often so, it will also help me get through the day lol. Or maybe you just wake up in the middle of the night and cant sleep like i do. It sucks being awake late at night when you want to be sleeping or dreaming, and youre tired and theres no one to talk to really. Idk ive been having trouble sleeping lately. Sometimes im not able to go back to sleep and the rest of my day sucks lol, but if you do something with your time or talk to someone, really helps you feel tired faster and fall asleep again. But yeah, feel free to text me and ill see whats up. It can be a meme, or a bunch of emojis, doesn‚Äôt matter, i can roll with the punches and keep the flow going. so, i hope to hear from some of you, and maybe we can share more music or something. exchange info, culture, ideas, etc, whatever is, I‚Äôm down to just chat! I know this isn‚Äôt a grand thing or anything, but i guess just extending my accessibility from reddit so that i can do more, or at least offer support and encouragement. might not seem much to any of you, but to me, having random people text me for whatever reason is like any other source of dopamine that you get from like winning an intense game, video games in general, etc. Couldn‚Äôt think of many examples sorry, tired lol. All i know is, not only will this help me, but it may also help you, thats what i intend for it to accomplish. To offer some relief for those who reach out to me. I wish i could do more or be there for everybody, but i guess this is all i can really do right now. Sometimes, having contact or simple communication from a stranger is all we need to get through a bad day, or through tough times in general. I know i could use some. We‚Äôre not all broken, so lets help build each other up and stay strong. What doesn‚Äôt finish you, only make you more difficult to defeat for the next obstacle you face. overcome your challenges, take control of you life. Set your goals, set your mind, and you can do anything!  Hope you are all doing well. Stay safe, and take care!",0.023394660894660895,0.54277898027898,riverside

While first weeks back usually bring excitement and energy, all of us moving from one building to the next, it goes without saying that this year is different. In regards to this, how are your classes going so far? Do you find yourself able to take notes, ask questions? Have any of your classes shown themselves difficult, if not manageable? Teaching a writing course myself, I definitely recognize that fifty-minutes is ***not*** enough time for teaching a writing class online (technology issues, waiting for students to enter, etc).

5601,Deejays and Vinylphiles Club (DVC) General Meeting,1,2020-10-11 17:35:33,5,"&amp;#x200B;

Hey everyone! I'm the public relations officer the Deejays and Vinylphiles Club (DVC). I wanted to reach out to incoming students or anyone that is interested in becoming a DJ.

Quick Introduction: The DVC at UCR was started by Richard Nguyen (DJ Simplex) on Jan. 2014 as a means to create UCR's first network of deejays. A club extended from San Diego to Riverside, the DVC brings people together with a similar passion for music. Today, the club continues to act as a network, while additionally providing new and aspiring deejays the lessons and experience required to become a great deejay.

In the past, DVC has played at UCR's Block Party, Heat Music Festival and Spring Splash concerts. Our alumni &amp; current deejays have gone on to deejay at Coachella, Sevilla of Riverside, Teregram Ballroom Los Angeles and Brownies &amp; Lemonade.

No prior deejay, music production or music experience is required to join DVC at UCR. General meetings range from discussions about deejay philosophy to mixing demonstrations to modern music analyzation to marketing yourself as an artist at UC Riverside.

If you're interested, we have our first general meeting of the year this Wednesday 10/14 at 7pm on our discord. You can DM me for more details OR you can fill out this signup sheet [https://forms.gle/KXmpzfU6icVqmGJT8](https://forms.gle/KXmpzfU6icVqmGJT8) so that we can reach out to you.",0.19233511586452762,0.4198752228163993,riverside

I am looking into courses for the upcoming quarter, and I had a question. Does anyone know of any courses in Ethnic Studies that provided credit simultaneously for the ""Ethnicity"" requirement and the  ""Fine Arts, Literature, Philosophy or Religious Studies"" requirement? On the other hand, if there is a course that provides credit for the  ""Anthropology, Psychology or Sociology"" requirement along with one of the above requirements, I would greatly appreciate the heads up.

I saw that  RLST 012 is ""Cross-listed with ETST 012."" However, it is also stated that ""Credit is awarded for only one of ETST  012/RLST 012 ..."", so I think that this means that I can use this course's credit for either ETST or RLST, but correct me if I'm wrong.

5657,I GOT SCAMMED 1K TRYING TO TRANSFER MY UVT LEASE TO SOMEONE,1,2020-10-14 22:43:02,20,"Hey all. Obviously, as the title states, I did get scammed trying to get out of my University Village Towers lease. One of the only ways to get out of a UVT lease is to have someone take over the lease you signed. I had been looking for months and I had almost given up until my friend told me that her replacement, Emily, knew someone who wanted to take over my lease. So my friend give my number to Emily and she messages me about how her ‚Äúfriend‚Äù Evelyn was interested. Emily asked me to cover September‚Äôs rent as she told me her friend was going to move in in October. I agreed because I thought that was fair, so I paid Emily the money through apple pay and Venmo. Now obviously looking back on it, this was a stupid mistake, but please understand that I was desperate, and I thought I could trust Emily because she took over my friend‚Äôs lease, claiming to be a UCR student. Basically, Emily tells me the next day that she and her ‚Äúfriend‚Äù went in and made the arrangements for the transfer, and that I would receive an email from UVT to sign the lease over to Evelyn. A week passes and I never receive the email, so I finally get suspicious enough to call UVT about it. Low and behold, there was no Evelyn in their records of people who applied for a room. I confront Emily about it and tell her to send me Evelyn‚Äôs number. I call the number and get an automated message telling me that the line was not in service. So by then, I knew it was a scam for sure and contacted my bank, the police, Venmo, and Apple Pay, all of which could not help me get my money back. I resorted to Instagram to ask for help, and the real Evelyn reached out to me through my post, telling me that this Emily girl was falsely using her name, that they were not friends, and that EMILY was the one who had recently taken over her lease at Grandmarc. So, me and my Instagram friends continued to text Emily in hopes that she would respond to me and hopefully give me back my money. However, she ended up playing victim, blatantly lying that it wasn‚Äôt not her, and did not me back. So, now that I‚Äôve blocked her, I hope that those of you out there looking to find a replacement for your lease be careful out there. This woman scammed me of $940 dollars. Her name is Emily Parra, claims to be a 3rd year psych major at UCR, and also has social media for which she goes by the surname of Cuh/uh. So if she reaches out to you from this info, DONT RESPOND.",-0.02916666666666667,0.45422222222222225,riverside

THIS PAST YEAR OF DOING ONLINE CLASSES HAS BEEN EXHAUSTING, STRESSFUL, MENTALLY DRAINING, ETC. YOU NAME IT. IT'S TOTALLY NORMAL IF YOU DON'T FEEL MOTIVATED OR HAVE THE NECESSARY ENERGIES TO SIT THROUGH HOURS OF LECTURE RECORDINGS OR ZOOM MEETINGS. WHAT'S THE USE OF SPENDING ALL THIS TUITION MONEY IF YOU CAN'T MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY PERFORM AT YOUR BEST? TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR OWN LIFE! TAKE A GAP QUARTER OR EVEN A GAP YEAR. MAYBE BECOME A PART-TIME STUDENT. IN THE MEANTIME, EXPLORE. DIVE DEEP INTO YOUR HOBBIES AND INTERESTS. PERHAPS FIND A PART-TIME JOB (IF IT'S SAFE), SAVE/MAKE MONEY, GO OUTSIDE, MAKE ART, FIGHT RACIAL INJUSTICE, BECOME POLITICALLY AWARE, OR WHATEVER. BE INSPIRED. THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO DWELL ON SHITTY TIMES. EVEN WITH ALL THE DIFFICULTIES YOU ARE FACING, ALWAYS FOLLOW YOUR HEART! 

NOW I DON'T WANT TO OFFEND THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL CAPABILITIES OR NECESSARY MEANS TO MAKE WHAT COULD BE A LIFE-CHANGING DECISION. I JUST WANT TO BE HERE TO ADD SOME POSITIVE ENERGIES TO Y'ALL'S MENTALS AND ENCOURAGE Y'ALL TO GO GET IT---WHATEVER IT IS YOU DESIRE.

WHEN COVID-19 IS CONTROLLED PROPERLY, I HOPE THAT YOU ALL GAIN MORE CLARITY INTO WHAT YOU WANT OUT OF LIFE. HUMAN LIFE IS TOO BEAUTIFUL. YOU CAN'T BE HINDERED BY YOURS PEERS' JUDGMENTS. ENJOY IT. 

Personally, I will transition into my schooling part-time as I will only take 8 units. Initially, 12 units was a lot, especially for the already difficult classes I was taking given how remote learning makes it that much harder. I want to use my extra time to explore my hobbies and interests. Perhaps I will get a part time job to save and make money. To me, there is no point in college without the social interactions and the relationships you create. When COVID-19 is over I would want relive campus life and regain the time that I was stripped away from me because of this pandemic.

During quarantine, I've spent way too much time alone. But that allowed me to constantly contemplate and self-reflect.  I've thought about my friends who live way too far from me to visit and haven't seen since spring quarter. I've thought about the friends I've lost, and sincerely hope to make amends. I've thought about what I ultimately want to get out of my life, especially when I'm so young, heading into my 20's.

I encourage you all to do the same. Take action and reflect. Know yourself and the world more. Most importantly, don't exhaust yourself. 

Peace.

The Coronavirus: Student Experiences (CSE) Study, an online survey study, is seeking college/university students in the U.S. to report how they are coping during the COVID-19 pandemic.

You can find out more about the study here: [http://fullerton.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_emaleTw8WK9KX8V](http://fullerton.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_emaleTw8WK9KX8V)

You are eligible for the study if you are: (a) At least 18 years old; (b) attending a college or university in the United States; and (c) available and willing to complete both baseline and follow-up surveys.

The study will ask you to complete: 

* 1 Baseline survey (approximately 30-45 minutes), followed by
* 3 Follow-up surveys (approximately 15 minutes), which take place every two weeks.  

These surveys will ask you about such topics as your stressors and coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic, mood and anxiety symptoms, health, and academics.  The study closes on December 11, 2020.

Overall, your total expected time commitment is about 1.5 hours.

**Compensation**

The following compensation applies to participants that are *not* part of the CSU Fullerton Psychology Department Research Pool: 

* For completing the baseline survey and all three follow-up surveys by December 11, 2020:
   * If you are the one of the first 25 participants to complete the requisite surveys, you will earn a $20 Amazon gift certificate;
   * If you are not one of the first 25 participants to complete the survey, you will be entered into a drawing for a $30 Amazon gift certificate.  (Odds of winning: maximum 1 in 3)
* *Note:* 
   * **You must start the study no later than October 30, 2020** in order to be able to complete all four surveys in time.
   * As explained in the informed consent form, survey entries that are flagged as reflecting unusually poor effort will not count towards compensation.

I didn't know it would happen I didn't know I didn't know I swear to God I didn't know I DIDN'T FUCKING KNOW

I was supposed to cancel my housing contract earlier so I wouldn't be stuck with housing payments this year if I stay home.

Because I really don't want to be on campus this year. Or any more. OR AT FUCKING ALL.

My parents are kinda really really REALLY REALLY FUCKING ANGRY THAT I STILL HAVE THE FUCKING CONTRACT. But if I go back to the apartment I feel like it will severely harm my mental health.

Personally I'm not capable of roommates. I'm not capable of living with people other than my family for an extended amount of time. I've never been very socially motivated (i.e. I don't give a fuck about friends and if I do, it's because I hate myself) so I can't really be on friendly terms with anyone.

I'm angry at my roomates. I can't deal with people who play video games all the time and yell ""FUCK YOU BITCH"" every other five minutes when they play their FUCKING OVERWATCH

EVERY OTHER FUCKING NIGHT AND DAY.

Sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry I'm so fucking sorry sorry sorry

I've been coping with this roommate situation for the past two years.

I have a really bad social phobia. That, or I just don't care to talk. I don't know how to compromise. I don't know how to deal with people disliking me - honestly I just assume everyone will learn to hate me one way or another. And I'm scared asf of making people angry. but I've been developing even worse anger issues. I've never known anything other than passivity or passive-aggression. I've always had anxiety problems and I've always had anger problems stemming from anxiety problems but they only arise in very specific situations.

I swear I'm not crazy I've just always been severely psychologically damaged to the point where I can't really bother to fix my problems properly.

I've already had two run-ins with Student Conduct over my behavior at the apartments so I REALLY don't want to deal with FUCKING ANNOYING roommates anymore.

On the other hand, academics have never been a problem for me. Don't ask me about them it feels like I have had it too easy my entire life.

I returning to UCR next quarter after taking some time off to go to a community college and was wondering how the online learning is scheduled and structured and really the general consensus among students about how they feel the distance learning is going. At the community college I was at, the online classes were very laid back, there were no set schedules, there were no mandatory zooms, and you had until Sunday night to turn in all of the assignments. It was almost criminal how easy it was. This made my work schedule GREAT but I figure I'll have to cut back my hours once I come back. I know it won't be so laid back back at UCR, but I wanted to know how the scheduling worked. Is it still T/TH and M/W/F with set lecture times? How is this all effecting how the professors teach and grade?

More importantly, how's everyone feeling about the distance learning at UCR in general? I see university students have generally found it difficult to get a quality learning experience from the distance learning.

My counselor said:

Repetition of Courses Repetition of courses not authorized to be taken more than once for credit is subject to the following conditions: generally, a student may repeat only courses in which a grade of ‚ÄúD,‚Äù ‚ÄúF,‚Äù or ‚ÄúNC‚Äù was received. In some circumstances, students may repeat a ‚ÄúC-‚Äù to satisfy an academic requirement. Courses that would place the student above the 16 unit maximum will not be included and will not be split. For example, in courses taken to meet the Entry Level Writing Requirement, such as ENGL 004 and ENGL 005, students must earn a grade of ‚ÄúC‚Äù or higher to satisfy the requirement, so students who receive a grade of ‚ÄúC-‚Äù may repeat the course. POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 52 | Degree credit for a course will be given only once, but the grade assigned at each enrollment shall be permanently recorded. In computing GPA of an undergraduate who repeats courses in which the student received a ‚ÄúD‚Äù or an ‚ÄúF,‚Äù only the most recently earned grades and grade points shall be used for the first 16 units repeated. In the case of further repetitions, the GPA shall be based on all grades assigned and the total units attempted. Courses in which a grade of ‚ÄúD‚Äù or ‚ÄúF‚Äù has been earned may not be repeated on an S/NC basis. Repetition of a course more than once requires approval by the appropriate dean in all instances. The Department of Veterans Affairs will not consider toward full time those units which are a repeat of courses in which a grade of ‚ÄúD-‚Äù has been received, unless a higher grade in the course is specifically required for graduation. Contact the Financial Aid Office, (951) 827-3878, for additional details.

* ""UncleTouchy'sNakedPuzzleBasement"" (You scare me, but access is access.)
* ""joe mama"" (cute.)

I‚Äôm currently taking general chemistry at my community college but I honestly feel that we‚Äôre not learning much, since it is online and also because I feel that we‚Äôre skipping topics and labs, which worries me since I know that organic chem is much harder and is at university level compared to community college. 

My weird question/request is... if anyone that has taken general chemistry here at ucr , perhaps could give me any tips, notes, recommendations, or anything that I might need to know, or that can help. I don‚Äôt really want to spend a year here at my community college learning things that might not help me succeed in ochem once I transfer to ucr, if that makes sense.

My roommates are really nice and sweet and i'll give them that. they're all close friends with each other. they're (sorry) lowkey judgy and I know i'll always be on the outside of their group. 

Clubs are a mixed bag, they've been alright but with the whole covid thing, its really difficult to actually get to know people. 

I've been trying to make friends in my classes but so far nothing, everyone ends up ignoring my messages and im really not going to bother again before i make a fool of myself even more. 

I've only had luck with striking up conversations with either international or transfer students, which i don't mind. (sorry i'll say this but transfer students have been a lot more level headed and mature than others.)

My friends are still just the people i talk with from high school but they've all got their own college friend groups. I don't want to graduate with my only friends still being from hs. 

Part of me says that I need to just calm down and focus on doing my own thing since I feel like im spreading myself too thin with trying to talk to people.  Which yes is a good idea but I don't want a rerun of freshman year. I focused on myself and trying to grow but that ended up with me never making lasting connections. And I'm scared that the rest of my years here will be the same. 

I wonder if the right people will come into my life before I graduate, I see so many of these types of posts on reddit from juniors and seniors. I read in the comments that  so many people felt/feel like this. From PM's I've had with people on this damn site I know a lot of people feel like this.

I am currently enrolled in 12 units (three 4-unit courses), but unfortunately I need to withdraw from one of my classes, which would put me at a total of 8 units for the quarter. I read on the UCR financial aid website, but would like to confirm, if I withdraw from the class after the 60% quarter mark (which I believe is Nov. 17), I don't have to back back any aid? If I do, would it just be for the 4 units, or because I would be under 12 units, would I have to pay back the whole thing? I currently cannot afford to pay back everything I received this quarter, so I would really appreciate the help",-0.007142857142857141,0.31230158730158736,riverside

6201,Advice on CS111 with Elena Strzheletska,1,2020-11-17 15:06:09,13,"Hey, I hope everyone's doing fine. I'm a second-year UCR student struggling really hard in CS111 and I'm in the need of some advice.  
The problem: I'm currently struggling to maintain a D in the class.  I've talked to my academic advisor but they told me that if I'm failing I just had to pass. I talked to the professor myself during office hours but she just told me to ask her again some other time for advice. So now I'm here to ask if anyone can give me some advice on what I can do to get ready for the final and pass the class.

My opinion: I feel like there's not much I can do in this class. I don't really agree with how she gives out every quiz before the homework for that quiz. We also took a quiz before our previous homework was even finished being graded. Although the homework assignments are designed to be much harder than the quizzes, my average grade for the HW assignments is an A while my average grade for the quizzes is an F. It has never really been clear exactly what topics will be covered on the quiz. There are 4 quizzes and these are worth 40% of our grade. The first quiz had the opportunity to give you negative points as to punish guessing. So the strategy was to not put anything at all if you weren't sure if your answer was entirely correct. The second quiz gave no partial credit at all. A practice quiz for the third quiz had a question that the professor said would be on the quiz; however, there was a typo on the practice question and so it was unsolvable and confusing. Supposedly, students from a section later on in the day can see the quizzes my class takes on iLearn and one of those students got a perfect score even though the quizzes are different since they knew what kind of material would be on it. Since my grade in the class is so low, I've started skipping meals, other lectures, and hours of sleep to get a better grade but it's not happening. I'm starting to feel ill, little motivation to keep trying, and my body is starting to feel constant pain.  I know this sounds pretty dramatic but it's true. I'm not feeling very well right now and I just want to pass this class for the amount of time I'm trying to put into it. I have already changed the grading to S/NS so that it won't hurt the GPA I've tried to maintain. Please let me know if there's still anything I can do if I keep trying.

6237,Do y'all think grad school would be worth it next year if things remain in this online format?,2,2020-11-19 00:41:08,4,"So my original plan was to graduate, start my career, and then go back for an MBA after a few years. But things are looking kinda rough out there, so I've been considering going straight to grad school next year to sharpen my skills while I wait for the job market to rebound. 

The thing is, I wouldn't get into a good MBA program out of undergrad bc they want applicants to have a few years experience. So if I did go next year, I would probably be going for an MFin program (master of finance). Which means that I may possibly end up going to grad school twice bc I'd still want the MBA later down the road. But, grad school isn't cheap lol. 

I love learning, and part of me feels like I can't go wrong investing my own education; but the other part of me feels like I need to chill and only go to grad school once bc I owe that bitch Sallie Mae a small fortune. 

After 2 quarters and a summer on zoom, I feel like so much is lost just from not being in the classroom. So that's another reason why I'm second guessing the MFin for next year. 

On the other hand, a lot of my professors have been saying that going to grad school next year would be a good move bc we'd come out of this time of uncertainty with stronger skills and a master's degree, and It would buy us more time to figure things out.

However, I'm not sure if my financial aid already paid for the cost but if I drop one and then enroll for another right away how does that affect my student account/financial aid

I'm a part of TEDxUCR and I wanted to share this **free** event with you guys! The event features a Harvard graduate and trained neuroscientist/psychology researcher, UCR graduate student and Earth scientist, stories about discovery in Antarctica, and an astrophysics Doctor from the University of Nottingham!

Event Title: ORIGIN: Narratives of Discovery

When: December 4, 2020 @ 5pm PST

Event Description:  When we talk about our research, we frequently use the word ‚Äústory‚Äù to describe the collection of experiments that all address a particular hypothesis. Scientific communication has historically focused on translating scientific concepts into ‚Äúlayman's terms,‚Äù but what if instead of translating, academia incorporated storytelling principles into how they present their research to their peers and the general public?  


Bridging the gap between scientific discovery and understanding, this event will feature storytellers from different disciplines, giving them a platform to inspire academics from all levels of their career to find the narratives in their research to make their work accessible and easy-to-understand for the general public.   


Sneak peek of some of the Talk titles:

*  ""Can science help us fix our relationship with science?""
*  ""How field work ripped me of my pride, forced me to face my truths, and built my self-efficacy within the Earth Sciences""
*  ""Humans vs Machines: big discoveries in the big universe.""  
 

If you're interested in the sciences of just narrative storytelling in general, please RSVP! For more detailed speaker reveals, follow us on IG at tedxucriverside :)

Now, the description of phys 7 says that this class is a ""non-technical presentation"" of these concepts, and given that there are no pre-requisites, I can't imagine that the class is heavy in math, especially in math classes that I never took. Is this an accurate assessment? Or should I ***not*** register for these classes? Will I die in this class if I don't have an academic background in physics or advanced math?

6393,Cheating is Gross (RANT),1,2020-11-25 06:37:15,9,"I have been studying for a midterm intensely for the past 3 days and I got an honest 90% on the midterm. This midterm wasn't proctored and it was under relatively strict time constraints given the mathematical nature of it. Since it wasn't proctored, I could have easily turned to Google had I wanted to, but you see, unlike many others apparently, I have this trait called **integrity**. Do you want to know what the class mean was for the midterm is? 

Nearly 100%. 

I have taken midterms in the same class difficulty of this course when classes were in person, and the mean was never near 100%. Even in the highest averages I have ever seen announced during an in-person math class barely scratched 85%. Not to say that no one got an honest 100%, but for a class with near 200 people, that seems to be *highly* implausible. 

I am so glad that I am not a professor right now because I would be sent into orbit if I were given these means. What is the point of attending university if you're going to Chegg n' cheat your way through it?  If you're here because you don't care about learning and you're just looking to beef up your resume with educational experience, you're better off just attending a vocational/trade school because you are not cut out for university, sweetie. 

Do you know what the nation needs?

More skilled laborers.

Do you know what the nation doesn't need? 

People without integrity filling up spaces in universities where they have no interest in being educated.

If this post offends you, it's probably because you have been called out for the fraud that you are, and have been served a nice, blistering hot cup of reality. -end rant",0.21016190476190474,0.5283619047619048,riverside

6401,(applying to ucr) Advice from anyone who transferred to UCR?,1,2020-11-25 11:27:22,14,"Hi, I'm a high school senior that's currently applying to UC: R.

To begin, UCR is simply my dream school. It's in an amazing area, I know so many people there, it's close to many popular areas, and the campus is beautiful. On top of that, I feel like it's a school that genuinely cares for its students (though I haven't been confirmed on this) as opposed to other tougher UC's. 

The thing is, I had a pretty good chance at getting in because I did really well on my SAT (1440), but unfortunately, they aren't looking at SAT scores this year; and my GPA isn't that great (3.7 UC Weighted/Capped). I'm also Out Of State (OOS). (I know it's expensive but my family is gonna move with me so we'll be able to get residency shortly after).

So, I'm considering the chance that I might not make it into UCR, and I wanted advice from people who transferred to UCR from another school. I know that it's too early to decide and that I don't need to transfer, but I'd just love to know, just to evaluate my options.

Term Plans are meant for students to be used to customize and fit to their schedule however they please. Knowing which classes they want to take and where they want to focus on is their decision, advisors can assist their students and help them in many ways. Sometimes term plans are meant for students to adjust to their schedule before the actual registration starts.

However, there are some advisors that REQUIRE TERM PLANS IN ORDER TO REGISTER. Some advisors put a HOLD ON YOUR ACCOUNT that limits you from REGISTERING EVEN WHEN YOUR TIME TICKET IS CURRENTLY UP. 

My situation, well I currently NEED to register BUT MY ADVISOR leaves a TERM PLAN HOLD on my account which means a HOLD that PREVENTS ME FROM REGISTERING WHEN IT IS CURRENTLY MY TIME TO REGISTER. WHAT IS EVEN MORE INFURIATING IS THE LAST EMAIL I SENT SAYING MY TERM PLAN IS UPDATED AND PLEASE REVIEW IT, THEY GO ON THANKSGIVING VACATION WITHOUT CHECKING AND LEAVING ME ON HOLD UNTIL THE THANKSGIVING BREAK IS OVER. I TRIED TO GET INTO CONTACT WITH THEM THE DAY OF THEY DECIDE TO LEAVE FOR THE BREAK BUT NO RESPONSE. ADVISORS THAT LEAVE THEIR STUDENTS HANGING WHILE THE SAME STUDENTS SUFFER THE BREAK WITHOUT REGISTERING IS COMPLETE NONSENSE, ESPECIALLY WHEN CLASSES FILL UP EXPONENTIALLY. 

SO LIKE, EVEN IF I WERE TO SEE MY CLASSES THAT I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN BEFORE MY REGISTRATION TIME TICKET ARRIVED, I COULD NOT HAVE REGISTERED FOR THEM BECAUSE OF THE NONSENSE OF A TERM PLAN HOLD. 

NOW I HAVE A NEW TERM PLAN, BUT NO ADVISOR TO RELEASE THIS NONSENSE OF A 
T E R M  P L A N  H O L D !!! SO NOW I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE BREAK IS OVER TO TRY TO GET A HOLD OF MY ADVISOR, WHICH MEANS MY CLASSES I CHOSE IN MY NEW TERM PLAN HAVE A HIGH CHANCE OF FILLING UP THANKS TO NOT BEING ABLE TO REGISTER

6441,Rant: How UCR has dealt with the pandemic...,1,2020-11-28 23:38:00,20,"I‚Äôm sure everyone is sick of Covid, but what bewilders me is why everything at UCR is closed/remote? For starters, I applied for financial aid over the summer and the financial aid never processed it!! I applied well before the deadline, and after weeks they never processed it. I emailed them cuz ofc they are remote, and they took over a month to respond! And when they did, it was early September and they told me their deadline to process applications was August and how I wouldn‚Äôt qualify since THEY missed the processing window. Then there goes $5,000 out of my pocket to pay.

On top of that, the advisors are a mess. I was told by my advisor I can be dual enrolled at a local community college for English and transfer credit. But after paying for the class, taking it, and passing it, my advisor notifies me that the credit won‚Äôt transfer. Like are you kidding me dude? And ofc they are only available via email too and it takes a month to have an email convo with an advisor, which is just ridiculous.

I‚Äôm a CNAS bio major currently taking ochem and other science courses with labs, all of which are online. I spend 6+ hours a week watching videos of other people do labs and doing online simulations where the lab TA‚Äôs don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs going on. This in itself undermines the value of education. I pay $30,000+ a year to watch other people do labs/perform simulation, then you are going to give me a lab final that is not adjusted to online lab standards? How can students possibly remember lab setups/protocols of we can‚Äôt do any of it ourselves?

So many other campuses throughout California have online options, at least with lab, where students are social distancing and wearing masks. I understand some student might feel uncomfortable, but there is a good number of students who want to be on campus, we can‚Äôt just conform to one group of people! There needs to be accommodations for everyone.

On top of that, undergraduate research is suspended and remote until further notice. That‚Äôs fine, it makes sense that undergrad research isn‚Äôt allowed until phase 3 campus operations, which conforms with Riverside county being in the red tier. But the problem is that THE SCHOOL DECIDES EACH QUARTER‚Äôs PHASE 3 MONTHS BEFORE?!!?! How is that even remotely practical? With a prediction that the covid vaccine will be widely available to the American public by March, will UCR not accommodate spring quarter? I have been told by campus admin that they will decide spring‚Äôs phase by the end of December 2020. HOW DOES THAT MAKE SENSE? So by the end of spring quarter, when top US health officials saying the pandemic can be over as soon as May, will UCR still be in Phase 2 operations?

I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is that it‚Äôs been a long 8+ months of not being on campus and feeling extremely unproductive. This virus isn‚Äôt going anywhere soon, and the campus must do a better job in accommodating campus operations as such. If other campuses, such as UCSD can have in person courses and control campus cases, so can UCR.

6445,Losing motivation,1,2020-11-29 13:53:16,20,"Just transferred this fall. It was hard to adjust academic wise, but I‚Äôve come to a point where I feel a huge loss of discipline. I started off alright, putting in effort for my courses, but now I‚Äôve been procrastinating heavily with the idea of ‚Äúgetting by‚Äù just to go back to sleep or relax in the end. Before studying, I just lay there feeling a bit drained trying to mentally prepare myself to spend hours upon a certain subject (mostly self-teaching, group discussions, sit through lecture, etc). 

I struggle to study at home do the overall environment and just feel stuck mentally and physically. Being able to go on campus even without so much interactions was like my getaway, finding areas to surround myself with people who have similar goals, even finding a empty environment that helped my focus stay clear, or go on short walks between class/break was very recharging. 

I guess this was more of a rant as I feel overwhelmed during this transition, especially while there are limited options. I‚Äôve started doubting my path and feel mentally unstable with the idea of continuing. How are you all coping?",0.09102182539682539,0.38918650793650794,riverside

6452,"I am in a terrible, depressing situation",1,2020-11-29 23:30:16,27,"Please pardon my persona non grata, I am uncertain if these types of emotional venting are acceptable or relevant enough to be viewed by a quasi-official subreddit for my university, but I feel as if this is the easiest way for me to release some bottled steam regarding this semester, for better or worse among my peers.

This is my first quarter as a Freshman majoring in a humanities subject.  Right now I am failing all of my classes of due to severe procrastination and mental impediments, I haven‚Äôt acquainted with anyone, and due to my off-campus status some of my financial aid is invalidated, so now I must find a few thousand dollars with such limited time, and no means of monetary procurement.

I was already apprehensive about attending college because I had such a dreadful time as a high school student.  I am incredibly asocial and probably have not talked with someone near my age face-to-face for a few years, let alone have a support system to motivate me.  A lot of this is probably my fault, but I know I am prone to bouts of depression, anxiety, and other stresses which debilitate my way to think, interact, socialize, and learn.

In other words, at times I don‚Äôt feel human.  I don‚Äôt feel like anyone.  I don‚Äôt have a personality.  I don‚Äôt have interests.  I just feel like an occupation of space which does enough to disguise itself as a facade of a being.  I feel like I have nothing to provide to the world.  I feel too young to become independent, and too old to be dependent on other people.  

I struggle to sustain interest in what I am studying, at times my internal discourse over the material makes me question my capability as a learner, instead I feel as if I am an imposter do-nothing lowlife who has no idea what they are doing or can fully comprehend what they are reading and writing, let alone make a prosperous life out of it.

I know this may seem like such a recycled narrative, and I haven‚Äôt provided a lot of context, but everything just seems so hopeless, and I fear my inability to recollect myself.  I know there are things of which I can do to improve my situation, but whenever I must push to state my claims to the outside world, I shrivel in fear of humiliation.  At least my subconscious mind does.

Perhaps I‚Äôm barking up the wrong tree, but if anyone can say anything to what I have said, I would appreciate it more than you would think.  My struggles  are so resonant and cumbersome to me, but I could guess many are shouldering the same psychological burdens, and therefore my situation is not as special nor most demanding of attention.

I guess this was the best way I could put this into words in the middle of the night, so thanks for sticking with me, and I‚Äôm sorry if I have wasted your time.  Thank you.",0.04446301925025329,0.3985460992907803,riverside

I'm a freshman in UCR and didn't send my dual enrollment college transcript in at the right time. They allowed me to send it in late, but told me they would have to put a hold in my winter registration until they received the transcript. I sent it in immediately and waited the 10 business days they requested to process it, but I still had a hold on my registration. I know they received it as the status on MYUCR was received. The admissions office isn't accepting calls right now, so I was redirected to emailing them. I emailed them, as well as my academic advisor to get more information. My academic advisor responded saying that my transcript was received and processed, but I would have to contact admissions about the registration hold since it was an admissions issue. I just received a response from admissions a week after my initial email, telling me my transcript was received and credits were given and to contact my academic advisor if I had any further questions. I replied back asking again why I still had a registration hold for the transcript but i'm afraid it'll take them a week to answer me again and I wont be able to register on time.

Basically from my understanding, I have a reg. hold that shouldn't be there since the issue it was regarding has already been resolved.

I tried emailing the email of the person who personally told me I could turn it in late, but she's on maternity leave and understandably unreachable.

I'm starting to get a little bit worried that I won't be able to get into any research labs at this rate due to the pandemic, but I'll be (hopefully) graduating next year and it seems like my options are going down the drain as time passes. I have no idea where to start to look for research or how to start looking, and I know there's nothing on the research portal at the moment for CNAS research. I feel like this is one of the main reasons it's holding me back as well from wanting to continue exploring for research, but I honestly feel like a mediocre candidate at best and I feel like I won't be able to bring any value to the table. I know that's just me being hard on myself and all that, but it really puts a damper when I start thinking about going into a research lab. 

How did some of you guys get into your research labs, and what was the process like? If you were scared to apply because you felt like you wouldn't do well in research, how did you get over those thoughts?

6585,Predictions Regarding Fall 2021; Apartment Concerns,1,2020-12-08 13:45:53,1,"Hey everyone. I hope you all are doing okay as we approach the end of the quarter.

In terms of fall 2021, I'm having some internal debates about the status of next year's fall quarter. Right now I live in one of the off campus apartments and the particular apartment complex I'm currently renting from is pushing us to renew immediately or face rent hikes for every month we choose not to renew. 

If next fall is not online, then obviously it would make sense to renew because I need a place to live at that would be close to the school. If fall is still online, then for that quarter at least, it would not be worth it to renew my contract and pay rent for an apartment that would provide no benefit to me during that time period; right now I'm doing my online classes at home.

While one of these two scenarios in my mind are very likely to become reality, there is a third scenario that I am deeply concerned about which also could happen. Let's say that it is announced that fall 2021 is online. In that case, I think we can all agree that there is no point in returning to riverside for class purposes and most of us will continue to do online class at home or elsewhere. However, as time moves on, we will eventually reach winter quarter and spring quarter in 2022. Seeing that we are nearing the stages of getting a vaccine approved, most experts have said that the return to normal life will most likely occur in late 2021 or early 2022. If it is the case that progress is made on the vaccine and we start the process of returning to normal life around that time period and the pandemic approaches its end, I fear that there a possibility that if the school deems that the situation is under control by then, they might release a mandate which would basically say that for winter 2022 or spring 2022, we are required to return to school for in-person classes as part of our journey towards returning to normal life. 

This leads to the ultimate question and main issue of this post; 

If fall 2021 is online and we it ends up being that progress with the vaccine goes full ahead which would most likely show a good sign that the pandemic is nearing its end, what are the chances that the school would say for winter quarter 2022 or spring quarter 2022 that we would be required to return to in-person instruction for those quarters?

My logic is telling me that this third scenario, if it is announced that fall 2021 is online, people who are in my situation right now with apartments pushing pressure on us to renew will most likely not renew their contracts and go home. However, if the scenario plays out as I have described where the school mandates that we return for either winter or spring in 2022, those of us who chose not to renew as a result of fall 2021 being online would be screwed; we would have no place to live at or around riverside. Furthermore, out-of-state and international students who moved back home because of this pandemic would also be in a tough position because they would have to find a way to get back to riverside, find a place to live, and bring with them everything to meet UCR's requirements for returning. To the best of my knowledge, many apartment complexes around UCR don't offer housing contracts that would allow you to immediately move in after you sign the lease, especially during winter and spring season. 

I apologize in advance if this post comes off as a rant or as pure speculation about what might happen. However, given that the school really dropped the ball on issues such as finances, transparency, etc., I'm not entirely sure whether I want to make the choice to trust the school in terms of letting us know how things will be in terms of the state of our future academic quarters. Maybe it is worth it to renew my contract to avoid the situation I described above. If I do, worst case scenario in terms of my losses would be thousands of dollars of rent being paid for an apartment that I can't really use if school remains online. Maybe I shouldn't renew at all and take the losses with the monthly rent hikes I will receive for every month I choose not to renew going through October which is when my current contract ends. If I don't renew and by some chance the school mandates us back for winter or spring in 2022, I have nowhere to go.

Please comment below your thoughts, opinions, predictions, logic, etc. I'm still on the fence right now as to what I will ultimately do, but given the circumstances, I'm running out of time fast.",0.11661736411736413,0.4542791005291006,riverside

6615,is 20 units too much for a freshman?,1,2020-12-09 14:51:15,11,"I registered for 20 units for winter quarter but i'm concerned that i'll be overwhelming myself, especially since this quarter I have to take math 004 &amp; math is my weakest subject so I know I'll have to dedicate more time &amp; effort into it. My schedule right now is a CHASS 2 unit workshop, math 004, geo 004, engl 1b, and gsst 01s (I attached a pic of the actual schedule). I feel like this would be manageable but the fact that I have a math class every day is what is making me reconsider. The suggested 4-year plan for my major (psych) says I should take 4 classes this quarter, but is that necessary? If I drop one of my classes (gsst 01s is the one i'd drop) I would have 15 units. Additionally, I started fall quarter with 34.5 units from highschool AP &amp; CC classes, so it's not like i'd be behind on units since by the end of fall quarter i'll have 49.5 units.

Today he changed it after we emailed the dean, chair, and our ombudsman. Thankfully he is just going to down curve the final, which will preserve a lot of your grades for those of us who did not cheat.

6738,Fuck off you mf who asked me to cheat with you in the final,3,2020-12-18 01:52:51,15,"\*Spoiler alert: the following is gonna be a huge vent of a true story with multiple reasons attached.

FUCK OFF YOU MF!

So here's the thing.

I've been repeatedly asked by one of my classmates to cheat with her in our final(I think it's a her. Online teaching, so who knows. Apologies if it's a him). At first she said she wanted to call me during the exam. I said a firm no using a lame excuse, because I didn't want to sound fierce, though I did hope she can get the sign out of me using a LAME excuse. Apparently, she didn't. And right before the exam, she kept complimenting me(which made me super uncomfortable) and gave me hints to share my answers with her during the exam. I changed the subject with ""good luck"" as the ending of our convo. I thought that was it, after all there's only minutes left before the exam started. But I was wrong. After the exam, I reopened my discord, and there were three messages throughout the exam asking me about exam questions. At that time I was so flipped out.

We shouldn't cheat, and that is my No.1 rule. But there's more to it. I was wondering whether the spirit of ""NO MEANS NO"" has already gone? Or is it only applicable in a dating context, where my no only refers to physical intercourses? When I said ""no, I will not do this"", I literally meant every fucking word of it, which should be a clear end of our conversation. And by repeatedly asking me to do something against my free will after receiving my firm rejection is extremely disrespectful of my personal boundaries. As an adult with free will, I deserve to have my rights and boundaries respected.

I am well aware that this term has been difficult for everyone. Everyone has got their own issues in their life, at least more or less affected by quarantine and remote learning. That being said, exams are exams, and they should only reflect how much efforts we put in the subject and how well we've made the progress. I always kept that in mind, and never have I ever asked for any privilege from professors or TAs, even though it's been difficult for me as I come from a different country with English as my second language, and there's a 17-hour time difference which means I had to take lectures and exams at midnight, and it's my first term at UCR, and I've been preparing for graduate application in US at the same time as a senior year student. I never complained to anyone before, because those are issues of my own, and shouldn't bear anything on how my exams should be graded. I worked my ass up, and earned every point that I deserved. Don't you motherfucker just expect the same when you wouldn't even take a try. Why am I so confident that she didn't? Because she told me she didn't even watch most of the lectures, and didn't even know the questions, when she desperately asked me to HELP her out. Yes, just said like that, to my face.

Alright, I've let out all my vent now. I didn't mean to make this personal to that very motherfucker, or try to make myself look better by speaking out my issues. However, I do want to tell anyone who is complaining about exams, please be aware that you paid your huge tuition for a diploma that is worth more than a piece of paper and good yet suspicious grades. And when you decide to cheat or ask other students to cheat, you are turning their efforts into a big piece of shit, and they may have more issues than you do. Thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

TL,DR: Some motherfucker asked me repeatedly to cheat with her in a final after I said firm no's. This was against the rule of no cheating, harmful to the fairness of college education, making diplomas less in value, and disrespectful of people's free will and personal boundaries. I hope those who have the mildest idea of cheating in an exam can think through all these things listed above. Thank you.

‚Äú\[Professor\] did not make the transition to remote learning very gracefully. It is ironic that he studies education, yet there are many problems with how he conducts his class. My first point of contention is the way he uses lecture time. Students do not need 10-15 minutes in a breakout room to do one problem. These breakout rooms were useless as barely anyone would actually talk in the rooms, and I would prefer \[Professor\] to actually work out problems with us. At least make these rooms just five minutes! Next, there is no point in giving us Activity Slides without giving us the answers to the problems. What is the point of doing questions without having any way of checking them? It is quite negligent to not give out these answers because you base exam question off of these problems, or whatever other reason there is. How else are we supposed to properly prepare for exams? Lastly, \[Professor's\] demeanor with students has been pretty terrible. With this new format of learning we all have to deal with, instructors should be receptive to student concerns and work to adapt to remote learning. I get the impression that \[Professor\] stubbornly stuck to his old methods, constantly backing them up instead of taking constructive criticism into account. There is a fine line between confidence and arrogance. Here's some advice to take into account for the future: Students will be the most engaging with the class and material if they actually like the instructor. Seems obvious right? A professor's attitude and receptiveness can, and most likely will, become a student's main motivation to excel in a class. No matter how grueling and difficult any class may be, receiving some sense of support and being fair with students ultimately can be what makes or breaks a class. Hopefully these thoughts are actually taken into consideration. I get that on both sides of the classroom we are struggling with the circumstance at hand, but instructors need to be held more accountable as they have all the power in a class to make things fair or unfair.‚Äù",0.04882661198450673,0.47518227386648443,riverside

I did great in all my other classes, but again my grade in Chem001a is really shocking. Due to the final, my low A/high B grade just turned into a C+. 

Should I take chem001b? I feel pretty discouraged and don't want to continue the chem series.

6758,Academic Misconduct Allegation Help (Group.me),1,2020-12-19 14:56:02,21,"Sorry for the long post, this is more of a continuation of last weeks situation in which approximately 200 students on a groupme chat were suspected of cheating (https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/kb95oa/in_regards_to_group_mes_and_academic_integrity/).

Yesterday, Professor Bartels followed up with another email specifically to all students who were participants in the group chat, essentially saying that being a participant ‚Äúmore likely than not‚Äù means you cheated. In addition, he says that if a student is found responsible for academic misconduct they will receive an F in the entire course.

He gives the students two options, admit to cheating (in which sanctions will be given by SCAIP) or to deny the charges (in which SCAIP will set up an Administrative Review Meeting). 

Here are his words regarding writing a statement: ""Please go to this link within 14 days of the date of this letter and indicate if you admit to membership and/or participation in the class GroupMe where answers for smartwork and clicker questions were asked and shared or if you wish to challenge my information. Your response will be referred to SCAIP for appropriate follow-up.""

Here is where I am confused: from reading the SCAIP website the professor has to provide evidence with reasoning that a student has cheated, however, in the email he only says that being in the group chat ""more likely than not"" means you cheated.
Personally, I have not sent a single message on the groupme chat so I am unsure on how the process will undergo in terms of possible evidence that can be used in general. 

Lastly, what are some tips in writing my statement to deny these charges? Also, say after I deny the charges, how will the Administrative Review meeting work?",0.039455782312925174,0.539172335600907,riverside

I'm 59 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Riverside, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as a professor for the University of California, Riverside Campus, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. 

After having a glass of heated lactose and assigning several smartworks assignments in the middle of the night before going to sleep, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. 

I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any students, or things like grading and teaching, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with my job as a chemistry professor, and I know that is what brings me happiness and a $270k salary. 

Although, if I were to accuse 200 people of academic dishonesty, I wouldn't lose to the Dean or Ombudsman.

[https://youtu.be/PohWI97qP0Y](https://youtu.be/PohWI97qP0Y)

I started a new project titled ‚Äújust your existence is enough‚Äù (link above). Having battled a nasty case of depression my whole life and purposefully overdosing in march due to psych meds making me crazy lol, i figured its time we stop being afraid and speak up. As an engineer, I took an oath to ‚Äú practice integrity and fair dealing, tolerance and respect, and to uphold devotion to the standards and the dignity of my profession, conscious always that my skill carries with it the obligation to serve humanity by making the best use of Earth's precious wealth‚Äù and I intend on living up to it. I figure the best way to give back to my community is by sharing topics I learned in engineering school in a fun and educational way and to show others how engineering principles not only apply to the physical world but to our inner world and wellbeing as well. I would greatly appreciate if you can listen to this podcast thingy and let me know your thoughts, opinions, ideas. if you disagree with anything that I say, that is okay! do not be negative or leave a hate comment. Instead explain to me why you do not agree so I can better understand you. Remember we all perceive reality a bit differently, so while you may not understand my personal struggles because you did not struggle with the same things, we all struggle in one way or another.

Resources: If you are unable to seek help from a professional or too nervous at this time, below are resources that should guide the healing process. Remember there is nothing wrong with going to therapy!¬†

Feeling Good by David Burns: [https://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-N...](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFeeling-Good-New-Mood-Therapy%2Fdp%2F0380810336&amp;event=video_description&amp;v=PohWI97qP0Y&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqblFMLXB2akpDN1dhckRSbFFLU0dQVkFJeW11QXxBQ3Jtc0ttcDRaTGU2ZEZfRUZwOUNTZ01FMndGVW5RVkg4LXlyMVQ5eHZTbl9YZWFMOHdoU3hvb1JIclNjaVdRYXh6U0RlTEFEVDRzUHJ2ZS11UXRDOEVQc0E0cXlmUURGc29YZkpDZEFHTDdRRzN6TnVSeGlZbw%3D%3D) Scientifically backed ways to out train the negative thinking, depression and anxiety. This book served me wonders in addition to therapy. What science shows is if you dedicate \~3 months to processing the pain and healing, a lot of the depression and anxiety can go away. The main point being you do it now rather than later so when tough events happen later in life, we know how to properly deal.¬†

The Holistic Psychologist: [https://www.youtube.com/c/TheHolistic...](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheHolisticPsychologist/featured) she explains how events shape us, attachment theory, letting go of the past, etc in a productive and helpful manner¬†

Andrew Solomon Ted Talk: [https://youtu.be/-eBUcBfkVCo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eBUcBfkVCo) \- goes over his own battle with depression and the correlation between adverse experiences and mental health¬†

And lastly:¬†If you are currently struggling, just remember, you keeping yourself alive is winning because that is by far the hardest thing to do when you are in a dark place. Even if you struggle to get out of bed, shower, or eat,¬†you are still alive and that is all that matters. Please put your wellbeing first and learn how to make yourself a priority. During the rough times, someone very dear to me would remind me that ‚Äúthis too shall pass‚Äù and I pass that message along to you.¬†Feel free to share this or the resources with your family and loved ones!

Let me share with you guys a bit of my background. I am a community college transfer from Riverside City College, transferred to UCR in Fall 2019. During my time at community college, I worked at a fast food chain as a Cashier for two years, and this is only my work experience. I didn't join any extracurricular activities because I did not have the time, because I think there were time consuming in my opinion. But believe me, I worked my ass off in job hunting for Internships, like Finance internships and anything else not even related to my concentration such as Accounting, Management, Marketing, Supply Chain, Business Analytics and Information systems internships. But I always get rejections from emails and interviews. As of right now, I have a 2.7 GPA (hoping to get my GPA to 3.0 by the time I graduate). I feel like if I dont land an internship before I graduate, it's the end of me, I believe.

My overall question is, can I still get a job right after I graduate from UCR with no internship experience? In terms of career, I'd like to work as a Financial Analyst, or anything position related to Finance at any industry like Banking, Big 4 Firms, Movie studios, TV Networks, Healthcare and etc, But at the same time, I am also open to any career opportunities like Accounting, Marketing, Management, IS, or Business Analytics.

6884,Good &amp; bad majors for college as an investment,0,2020-12-27 23:54:52,1,"Like me, a lot of you don‚Äôt have your parents bankrolling you through college. Many of you are going to graduate with 20-30 THOUSAND dollars in debt, and you‚Äôre going to be on the hook for that just 6 months after graduation whether you have a job or not. 

So, if you‚Äôre an incoming or current freshman in this situation, here are some good majors in each college, as well as majors that I‚Äôd avoid when viewing them as investments.

This is aimed at those of you who are freshmen because you still have time to change majors (especially if you‚Äôre in CHASS, since CHASS has a rule saying you can‚Äôt leave CHASS after year 1)

BCOE GOOD
CS, CSBA, CE, EE, Data Science, MechE

BCOE BAD
Hard to go wrong with any engineering degree tbh. None are bad investments imo. Just make sure you join engineering clubs and are in the top 40% of people in your major. 


If you‚Äôre premed then completely disregard the entire CNAS section. 

CNAS GOOD
Math (applied math in CS or accounting/finance), math for teaching, stats

CNAS BAD
Any of the sciences if you‚Äôre not thinking of becoming a professor or researcher (but even researchers get paid a low wage for their level of education)

CHASS GOOD
Econ/business Econ if you end up in the top 10%.
Pre-bus with an intention to concentrate in finance or accounting. 
Political science, psych, English, philosophy, Econ, history if you‚Äôre in the top 5% of your class with the intention of a good law school on a scholarship.

CHASS BAD
Honestly, all of the majors not in the good section will leave you without a good job for your level of education. Remember that this list only looks at money though. For example, psychology is the most common non-business CHASS major, and here‚Äôs someone giving you the truth https://youtu.be/GLwaJ9JXIw4

Also, please don‚Äôt let the occasional ‚ÄúI got a good job while majoring in X‚Äù sway your decision more than the publicly available earnings after graduation per major

6919,Career Advice from other International Affairs Major Alumni,1,2020-12-30 10:39:27,13,"Hello everyone, 

I recently graduated from UCR with a bachelor's degree in Political Science, more specifically as an International Affairs major. 

As a recent graduate I have no idea how to find jobs in my field of study, searching via indeed has not returned much options whether that be due to my location(Los Angeles), or because of the current global pandemic as a result of covid 19.

Currently I am working as an investigator for a Personal Injury Law Firm and to be honest this position does not  use my degree at all, in fact I just like a glorified office worker, and the Legal section is no where near what I want to do career wise. 

&amp;#x200B;

For any alumni who have graduated both recently or prior with a degree in Political Science/International Affairs how did you go about finding jobs in your field? What resources did you use, and what were come keywords or phrases you used on job search sites that helped you find jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest issue is that since I was a transfer student I did not have an opportunity to do internships since I had to hit the ground running and rush to finish in 2 years, and that lack of time only allowed me to form a relationship with only one professor. Currently my goal is either save enough money to continue a master's degree or until I have enough saved up to move to another city with more career/job opportunities.

But after those cheating cases that were all over this subreddit, I feel like people should really reconsider joining these big groupmes, or at least staying in them past a week or two into the quarter.

&amp;#x200B;

* Of the many people who join these, only a handful of people will likely contribute. The rest will just lurk in the hopes of getting free answers. If you're someone who wants actual discussion with your classmates, it'd be better to find these people and work with them privately.
* If you are looking to cheat, then this is honestly the worst way to do it. With everything online there's much better ways to get answers without leaving a huge trail and risking other people's academic records, and to be honest its probably more work to cheat than it is to just do the classwork (and you might learn something).

Looking to relet a shared room to two people by the end of the month. The lease is valid until August 23rd, 2021.

It is a 4x4 apartment, with the other three rooms occupied by 3 guys. All very friendly people that clean and keep to themselves. At the moment, they occasionally return home to their families or have work elsewhere, so they're not there all the time.

Within the room, there are two twin-sized beds, two desks; and two desk chairs, two separate closets with accompanying drawers.  
The shared bathroom is spacious, with two sinks and cabinets underneath both.

There is a shared laundry machine/dryer outside of the room. Utilities and Internet/WiFi are included in the rent.  
There is a complete kitchen with a microwave, refrigerator, electric stove, electric oven, dining area, and air ventilation.  
In the loft area, there is a TV mounted on the wall with a sofa and an armchair. There is also a balcony space that looks out into the common area shared by the residents.

It is about a 15 minute walk/5-8 minutes by bus/7 minutes by bike to the UCR campus. The apartment is also in close proximity to RCC, and has easy access to restaurants and grocery stores.

PM if interested.

7089,Tutorial: how to make zoom's google calendar integration work and join meetings easier,1,2021-01-05 11:53:16,1,"I used to think that Zoom's calendar was non-functioning, but I figured out how to make it work with Google calendar. You can put all of your classes into Google calendar and have it linked with the zoom client to join with one click once you have it open. This makes joining calls much easier. I am sure this works the same way with other calendar programs, but using your Google calendar associated with you ucr.edu email contains things in one place.

(For Windows 10, I would assume macOS works similarly)

1. Open Zoom and click ""meetings"" on the top bar
2. [Click the ""+"" and select ""Schedule from Google Calendar""](https://i.imgur.com/FI6zxsN.png), this will open your browser to link your Google calendar with your [zoom account](https://i.imgur.com/hZjRl5L.png).
3. [Select the account you want to use](https://i.imgur.com/MeOIXJm.png), I am using my ucr.edu email (blurred)
3a. Give Zoom access to view and edit your calendar. This step might make a ""[personal meeting](https://i.imgur.com/nYpluaG.png)"", you can just delete it.
4. [Create a new event for each class](https://i.imgur.com/l6Vrk95.png). **You need to have the zoom link in the description**. This is important otherwise it will not work.  
4a. You only have to make one week's worth as each event will be repeating.
5. [Click the refresh button](https://i.imgur.com/Nx53WuD.png) in the meetings tab in the Zoom client.

If you did everything correctly, [you should see a new meeting in the meetings tab](https://i.imgur.com/TcXO60R.png). You can only see the meetings for the day, so hopefully Zoom integrates a full week calendar in the future (unlikely).

1. If you don't have a specific link (iLearn [tab has this](https://i.imgur.com/onG3Ckv.png) instead of a sent link) then you can [click the ""i"" in the top left ](https://i.imgur.com/U3EvTJy.png) once you join the call to get a link that you can copy for the calendar.

If you repeated the events correctly (I do 11 weeks just to be sure), then you won't have to do this again unless the link for the meeting changes. All you have to do in that case is replace the link in your google calendar and update it for all of the remaining events at once. I hope this is helpful to other people.",0.12055335968379448,0.476602986385595,riverside

Guys, they are so understanding. They want us all to succeed. If you work hard &amp; advocate for yourself, the faculty here will stand behind you!

I am currently finishing my bachelor's in electrical engineering in Germany. I was applying to the RISE Worldwide Program which offers internships in other countries (sadly it got canceled due to covid). While applying I learned about this university.

I am considering doing a master's or Ph.D. program in us.

My points for it right now are:

\- I like the study system in us a lot more. Here in Germany, we have often only one big exam at the end of a course

\- I am interested in start-ups, which are almost nonexistent in Germany.

\- I love the idea of a campus culture

My points against it:

\- Very expensive in comparison to Germany

The transition to the job market and the ""real world"" without the safety net of the university and it's resources makes me anxious. My first two years were full of chill, TOO full of chill. I couldn't care less about my career (or did care about it but was too short sighted and prioritized other things). The last two years, I worked my ass off and am doing a lot better, but given my field, good job prospects require further schooling. And I'd rather much stop doing so much damn research. I always feel like my complacency past years impacted how much ahead I could be. And I just want to do better, a lot better, like maybe a damn masters degree and doctorate better.

Additionally, the pandemic is just hitting different now. Always being at home makes me feel like I should be doing more work. Like I should be productive all the time. And my friends and GF say that I should have some down time and time for myself. But I'm trying to boost my GPA, trying to gain an internship but feeling discouraged bc of my lack of experience, trying to finish up this side project I have. I just want to chill!!! I just want to have a day where I don't feel like I'm not being productive. But life doesn't work like that sometimes.

I admire y'all who work and keep up with your studies. I admire y'all who find time to be with family and your SO and are on the right path academically/career-wise. I'm trying to be like that man, I'm trying.",0.17847031440781438,0.38139499389499404,riverside

7167,Preparing for the job search for EnviSci undergraduates,3,2021-01-08 16:07:05,9,"There was a post a week ago asking for help/suggestion from previous environmental science graduates. I am sorry for the late reply as I am not normally active on Reddit :( There are only &lt;20-30 envisci graduates every year so you are not going to reach out to many of them Reddit unfortunately. I am creating this post to help with envisci undergrads who need advice and use this post as a discussion thread to answer any of their questions. Mods, if this is in violation of any rules, I apologize.  


FYI: I recently graduated and have conducted research within the department for 2+ years  


Environmental science basic/entry-level jobs/internships generally **require research experience, GIS software, coding, and use of Microsoft Office**.   
1. Research experience - cold email Professors in the [https://envisci.ucr.edu/faculty](https://envisci.ucr.edu/faculty) and ask about research opportunities. The envisci faculty is extremely welcoming to undergraduate researchers compared to other departments on campus. Even though you won't be working in the lab (obviously due to covid), there is still a potential of working in research remotely. If you are graduating this Spring ( &lt;6 months of research), it is still beneficial because you learn how their lab operates, what research they are currently doing, how your research contributes to theirs, build connections with the lab members, and have the potential to obtain a good letter of rec.   
2. GIS software - take **ENSC175\*** taught by Dr. Ajami THIS QUARTER, you'll dive into how ArcMap/ArcPro is used by environmental scientists for spatial analysis and remote sensing. Super helpful and better than self-teaching it.  
3. Coding - take **ENSC110\*** taught by King Fi Li THIS QUARTER. The last time I was talking to Dr. Li, he was thinking about switching from MatLab to R Studio. Either program/code you learn will be fine in meeting the job requirements.  
4. Microsoft Office - Google Docs/Sheets/Slides is fine but switch to Microsoft Word/Excel/Powerpoint if you aren't familiar with them. These are basic tools you should have learned from your group presentations in ENSC001/002/100/101/102.  
**\***Both of these classes are only taught winter quarter.

It's going to be hard finding a job right now due to the pandemic for envisci major as most employment opportunities are hands-on/require fieldwork. Don't be disappointed that you can't find employment right away! It's natural for college students, especially with an ongoing pandemic. A few of my peers have found jobs but most haven't and are working side gigs in Amazon or retail right now due to the pandemic.

I'm currently organizing a draft and collecting all of the emails of my peers who have voiced support and solidarity in submitting a mass complaint against our professor, however, I want to ensure that I consider all possibilities so that our voices may be heard by our department's admins. Our professor has had numerous complaints submitted against them in their 20year tenure and their Academic Probations has never resulted in any meaningful change or repercussions. We have no choice but to take this class since this Upper Div has only been taught by this professor in the last 5 years and they're completely unbothered by any of the complaints we've submitted to them so far as it's only resulted in them muting individual's respective chat abilities. I've never been in this predicament before, although, I have had bad professors in the past they've all at least been competent in their abilities to teach their students-- the same concession cannot be made for this professor. As much as I want to make due and make the best of this situation, I feel a responsibility to my peers and myself to move forward with this before it's too late. This person is a danger to the success of their students and their negligence only serves to damage the reputation of UCR.",0.030208333333333337,0.42291666666666666,riverside

This is my last quarter, and I can't fail because of his harsh grading. English is my second language. When I found out that he grades harsh, it affected my mental health and I started to worry about ""How am I gonna do this?"". I am worried about getting a D in this class because if I got a D, I'm done for, I won't graduate, I will have to retake this 109 class in the Spring 2021 in order for me to graduate.

When I was first accepted into UCR, it was a huge source of shame for me and I wanted to disappear. But after attending school and meeting great people, that shame began to fade away. I was pretty confident in myself and believed that I would be able to do well in life as long as I worked hard.

I got into a fight with my mom yesterday over something really dumb, and in a burst of anger, she told me how disappointed she was in me for only being able to attend a crappy university like UCR. She said that all the hard work and money she put into raising me was a waste.

I understand how my mom feels.

The thing is, however, during that period when I was feeling down about the school I got into, my mom told me that she was proud of me and that there was no reason to be ashamed about UCR.

Yesterday showed me the true feelings she kept hidden from me this entire time, and to be honest, I cried a lot afterwards.

I'm going to keep working hard, and will try to keep my head up. I hope that I can be proud of myself in the future, and that my mom will be too.

Thanks,

i want to minor in korean since i quite like learning about the culture+language, and i placed into kor005 for spring quarter. for anyone who is majoring or minoring in korean, what are the classes like? are they relatively easy or difficult?

so far i've been able to plan out most of the classes across four years, but i can't seem to find KOR 42 and 112 and AST 146. has anyone taken these in the past two years? wondering if i can still minor in korean without these classes (one is lower div and the other two are upper div iirc). 

not sure if this helps but i'm a cmd biology major so hoping minoring in korean won't be too difficult/the workload is light or average

7337,Undergraduate Research Study Regarding the Acculturation of East Asian International Students--Participation Desired,1,2021-01-22 17:59:41,0,"Hello there,  

I am currently a fourth year undergraduate student attending UCR and am majoring in psychology. I am conducting a research study on the effects of acculturation on the well-being and academic achievement of East Asian International students. Acculturation, put simply, is change that occurs when groups and individuals from one culture make contact with groups and individuals from another culture. The present study focuses on East Asian International students as East Asian culture is largely collectivistic and students may incorporate their interdependent views of self into their behavior abroad.   

For my study, I am looking to attain a sample size of at least 50 UCR students who are ethnically East Asian, who come from an Easy Asian country, and who are studying abroad for at least Fall 2020 and Winter 2021. Participants must be able to read and write English. Study participation involves completion of a 20-30 minute survey. Subject will be compensated with a raffle entry to win 1 of 3 $25 amazon or grocery gift cards (your choice) for completion of the survey. If you would like to participate, fill out this short interest form: [https://forms.gle/1d6qsTDw1iFxNA8aA](https://forms.gle/1d6qsTDw1iFxNA8aA) or email [jaqui009@ucr.edu](mailto:jaqui009@ucr.edu).

We came up with some ideas, but are hoping the UCR Redditors can help us with some better ones, or help us refine the ones we came up with.

Some of our ideas were:

*  sharing recordings of campus and local community leaders getting vaccinated via social media
* developing educational materials in a variety of languages and sharing them through outreach programs

7386,Dining staff really is amazing (long appreciation post),2,2021-01-28 12:21:28,12,"I never want to hear a mean thing about dining again. I recently got covid while living on campus (not from another person just from walking around and doing daily life stuff) and the whole transition to being in an isolation space was rough ngl. It‚Äôs boring, very minimalist, my room had its own set of complications, I really felt like shit some days, and it was actually really taking a toll on my mental health. 

But dining made my experience so so so much better. From the jump the folks that I talked to on the phone were so sweet and caring. My meals were delivered on time every day and filled to the top with snacks and fresh fruit, hella drinks, really good food, the works. It‚Äôs a nice touch that in isolation all scotty purchases are 40% off too and you can buy essential items like soap, toothbrush, shampoo, and some snacks too. They explained the process so clearly and that might not sound like a big deal but when you first get told you have to isolate it‚Äôs not just one call, it‚Äôs like 4 different ones that all have their own set of important information and it‚Äôs just one after the other after receiving really scary news ya know? Tbh when I was called I wanted to cry because I didn‚Äôt know what to expect and the thought that there is that whole new strain out there that‚Äôs more deadly really fucking scared me. But Dining really was so reassuring and sweet. I was even given a personal number to contact if I had any questions day or night. They helped me get a package delivered that had some important stuff in it (even though that‚Äôs not a service that goes through dining). Someone (not an automated message) sends daily reminders to place your food order if they notice you haven‚Äôt placed it yet. And they deliver everything to your door. Hearing someone knock everyday and tell me to have a nice day or that they hope I enjoy the food honestly makes my day. It‚Äôs so small but when you wake up some days feeling like you‚Äôve been hit by a train or just feel lonely as hell watching everyone out your window walk to get meals with their friends, that small gesture of kindness and moment of interaction really goes a long way. So thank you to all of the dining staff and dining student staff out there who might be reading this who have helped me out, your kindness and dedication has meant the world to me

tl;dr Dining has been amazing to me while I‚Äôm in my isolation space and if I could write them all personal thank you letters I would in a heartbeat. Dining deserves hella live on campus.",0.12870454545454546,0.5336742424242423,riverside

7404,Staff Assembly Advocates for Financial Equity for UCR,1,2021-01-29 16:56:12,5,"The following message was sent by Staff Assembly President Dennis McIver during the November UC Regent Board meeting: 

&amp;#x200B;

UCR is the realized dream of the UC founders, outperforming most universities in diversity and social

mobility. Sadly, staff and faculty have worked tirelessly to accomplish this in spite of decades of

systemic financial inequity.

UCR receives thousands of dollars less in funding per student than any other UC campus while

supporting the largest number of underrepresented minority undergraduates. This implies that our

diverse students are somehow worth less. Even before the pandemic, UCR was understaffed by

more than 800 people, leading many employees to do the work of two or more. We have reached

our breaking point and continued cuts will shatter our ability to fulfill the University‚Äôs mission.

We urge President Drake and the Board of Regents to address the financial and systemically racist

inequities felt at UCR immediately through smaller percentage budget cuts to our campus. The

Regents must also revise the formula for the allocation of state funds to provide more funding to

UCR so that we can right this historic wrong.

UCR has survived decades of inequity, but we cannot survive any longer without your intervention.

7424,Community Mental Health Resource- LA Warmline,47,2021-01-31 22:18:10,0,"Hello

I volunteer for the Los Angeles Warmline and wanted to pass on the information about the LA Warmline.

The number is **(855) 952-9276** .

The line is open every night, overnight from 10 PM-6 AM - including holidays. It is designed to be a supplemental resource to any therapy/counseling you may or may not have. If you ever need a few minutes to talk to someone about experiencing loneliness, financial problems, school stress, relationship problems, substance abuse issues, or any difficulties you may face, feel free to call.

The line is staffed by peers in the mental health community. Our peers are either involved in the mental health community, have a diagnosis themselves, or have family members who are mental health consumers.

This service is especially intended for anyone living in Los Angeles County, but we now actually take calls from all over the country!

Let them know you heard about it on Reddit!",-0.011111111111111112,0.34444444444444444,riverside
