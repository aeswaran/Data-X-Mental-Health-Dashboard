10,Coronavirus University Update,1,2020-03-09 04:23:48,0,"The university is going to release more information on protocols for the upcoming break. It is likely all university sponsored travel will be cancelled, and classes will be online for the next few weeks. They are currently modifying their website. their old verion is as follows: 
(Website Updated March 8, 2020)

Princeton, like other universities across the world, is actively engaged in efforts to prepare for and mitigate the impacts from COVID-19 (commonly known as coronavirus). Our top priority is to support the health and wellbeing of our community as we continue to advance our teaching and research mission. There are no reported cases of coronavirus at Princeton, however the University has restricted travel and implemented social distancing measures out of an abundance of caution. This website provides answers to frequently asked questions, as well as updates on health, travel and other University resources. 

Campus Update
In an effort to promote social distancing, University departments plan to cancel or postpone on-campus events. Athletic events will be limited in attendance to less than one-third of a venue‚Äôs capacity.

Classes and mid-terms are scheduled as normal the week of March 9, with social distancing protocols in place. After spring break week, beginning March 23, undergraduate and graduate lectures and seminars will move to an online format until at least April 5 and possibly beyond.

The University will continue to monitor this evolving global health situation and update policies based on the guidance of local, state and federal health authorities.

Travel Update
Princeton has prohibited all University-sponsored international travel and strongly recommends that University-sponsored domestic travel be canceled or postponed. The University also strongly recommends against international personal travel, as well as domestic personal travel by plane or cruise.

Students currently on study abroad may stay in place. If students choose to leave their study abroad programs, they must return to their permanent residence (not on campus). Students who had previously been studying in CDC Warning Level 3 countries have already left those countries. 

All students, faculty and staff returning from impacted countries (CDC Warning Level 3 and Warning Level 2 countries as well as USDOS Level 4 and Level 3 countries) must fill out the For Returning Travelers (COVID-19) online form before their return. This is both for those on University-sponsored and personal travel.

DOS Travel Advisories with Level Definitions

Prevention
University Health Services is prepared to support students if they become ill.

Prevention measures are similar to those utilized against the common cold and flu. Those measures include frequent hand washing and avoiding touching one‚Äôs face with unwashed hands. 

The CDC does not recommend the use of surgical masks by people who are well. Those who are ill should consult a healthcare provider about using a surgical mask to reduce the spread of their illness.

The University is conducting more frequent cleaning in common areas and on commonly touched surfaces, including in dining and housing spaces.

I know that the admin and faculty are very supportive, but are students (particularly guys) pretty welcome and tolerant of LGBTQ+ individuals?

I'm writing a paper about how the history behind the 2 cannon's on the Princeton campus is remembered &amp; why it's remembered that way, and I would like the your insight into it.

From my reading so far, it seems that Princeton &amp; Rutgers have a ""rivalry"" that is only upheld by a few students, primarily on the Rutgers side, and is generally perceived as a nuisance to Princeton. Would you agree with this statement, and if so are there any other examples of this?

Essentially, I want to make a case that the original history behind the cannon (in the revolutionary war, and transported to New Brunswick to defend against potential attacks in the war of 1812) has been replaced by a ""tradition"" of Rutgers students just generally being obnoxious, and that's how that's had an impact on how people perceive the cannons.

135,MAT 202,5,2020-05-12 03:22:21,22,"  

Several students have been charged with honor code violations in MAT 202 in the 2020 Spring semester at Princeton University. These charges come at a crucial time during which students are completing Dean‚Äôs date assignments and studying for final exams. Under normal circumstances, this would be a very stressful situation, but considering the current state of affairs in the nation, it can be overwhelming for every student in the course. 

An anonymous post was made on Tiger Confessions in which a person claiming to be a math PHD student and a TA for MAT 202 stated that the students had been baited by a professor. A quick look into Slader.com led to a contributor account with the user name ‚ÄúArthur Dent.‚Äù This particular account had posted only four solutions. All of the four solutions were for problems from the fifth edition of Linear Algebra with Applications by Otto Bretscher, the exact book used by MAT 202. Of those four solutions, one was in the assigned problems for problem set 9, and two were in the assigned problems from problem set 10. Specifically, 8.1 #23, 8.2 #37, and 8.2 #70. The time at which the solutions were posted was provided in a correspondence email with a content director at Slader after a request was made. The solutions were posted April of 2020. Problem set 9 was due April 27th. Problem set 10 was due the following week. Further inquiry to this account led to the Slader representative indicating that the email associated to the contributor account seemed to be fake. A separate correspondence with Slader stated ‚ÄúOur moderators have confirmed that the answers given by that user were nonsense but written to look like they were reasonable.‚Äù The solutions have since been removed, however screenshots were taken and have been linked to this post.

I am a Student at Princeton, and I made the poll in the MAT 202 GroupMe chat. Though I knew most students would be hesitant to participate, even a small amount of information would help shed light on what is going on. Currently, the poll stands at 9 students who claim their charges relate to problem #23 from section 8.1, one student claims their charge relates to problem #37 from section 8.2, and zero students have selected ‚Äúnone of the above.‚Äù I am not writing this message to accuse any professor of entrapping their students, what I intend to do is bring to light some peculiar information about a situation which has already raised many red flags. Cheating is not right, it reflects poorly on one‚Äôs character and negatively impacts peers who put forth an honest effort. But as detrimental as cheating may be, entrapment is just as harmful and just as dishonorable.

253,Research on Major Selection at Princeton,5,2020-07-21 07:29:52,1,"Hi! I‚Äôm an UCI research assistant and I was assigned the task of understanding how major selection works in a few top colleges, one of which includes Princeton. I was wondering if you guys could help me out with a few of your opinions; it definitely doesn‚Äôt have to be objective, I‚Äôm grateful for all the information, however subjective, I can collect. I've already perused the website and statements by admission officers, but I wanted to hear from actual students, so educated guesses (or even speculation) are all appreciated!

So, here are the questions:

1. Does Princeton require you to input an intended major on your application? Can you put undeclared?
2. If Princeton does require an intended major, after you‚Äôre accepted to Princeton with that intended major, does Princeton expect you to follow through? For instance, if a student picked ‚ÄúComputer Science,‚Äù will Princeton funnel that student into an engineering department and expect him/her to take engineering courses and activities, or does Princeton really treat everyone the same way no matter what they picked for intended major (at least until they declare)? Is there a limiting of options in regards to classes, activities, etc. for certain majors, even unintentionally?
3. I saw that there was a deadline difference between A.B. and B.S.E degrees, with B.S.E degrees having an earlier declared major deadline. Do you think this affects major selection/major changes (or generally anything about majors) in any way?
4. When does Princeton expect students to declare their majors by? Can a student be truly ‚ÄúUndeclared‚Äù up until the point of declaring their majors?
5. And lastly, based on your opinion, does intended major affect admissions? A lot of colleges I‚Äôve looked into have stated publicly that the intended major does not affect admissions, but we also know diversity in ideologies (and thus major) is also important. This, of course, is a very touchy subject and I‚Äôm definitely not expecting the absolute, objective truth for this question; just wanted to hear your thoughts.

Other than these questions, if you have any other comments you could share about how students are pressured to take certain majors over others at Princeton, and any reason they would change their major: they would be appreciated!

I'm wondering if there's a strong correlation between your intellabilities type and what your college major is. The test takes 10-15 minutes and tells you what college majors are the best for you based off your intelligence type. Curious to see what you guys think of it. I'm also wondering if ivy league students are more likely to be in certain Intellabilities types.

Princeton is currently on the list of programs I'm looking at, and I wanted to get any input here about the program before applying!

I know many in CS poo-poo the idea of getting a master's degree, but for reasons I'm happy to get into if asked, I'm 99% sure that this a master's is the right next step for me.

My interests in CS lie primarily in machine learning (more because I have research experience in the field than anything else), formal methods/logic/theory, and security. If any of you are CS graduate students involved in these fields, I'd love to know your experience with the program. If not, I'd still love to hear your thoughts. 

Princeton being Princeton, I'm a little concerned about how master's students are treated as opposed PhD students when it comes to academic mentorship and opportunities. I've also heard horror stories (not necessarily from Princeton, but from similar big-name CS schools) of PhD advisors 

For context, here are the other schools I'm looking at (and a fair warning, this list is way too long and part of the reason I'm looking for feedback is to help trim down this list): KTH, ETH Zurich, EPFL, Stanford, University of Michigan, CMU, Cornell University, University of Pennsylvania, Yale University, University of Wisconsin, University of British Columbia, Oxford University, Cambridge University, Harvard University, McGill University, Kings College London.",0.21935045948203843,0.4941311612364244,Princeton

323,Interviewing for a job in Lawrenceville. How is Princeton to live in as a single 24 yr old?,1,2020-09-02 02:20:06,33,"Title says most of it. Single 24 year old guy potentially moving from NNJ to take a job right on the border of Trenton and Lawrenceville. Princton seems to check the boxes for me but I figured I would ask you experts here for your thoughts.  
  
  
housing: Would like to spend &lt;1500, but prepared to spend up to 1800 if needed. I would need parking. Is it recommended to live downtown near the university or outside? It would be cool to be walking distance to bars/restuarants but not needed. Hoping to have a 1BR but could compromise with roommates (ideally 2br 2ba).
  
  
Would like to be &lt;30 minute commute. Google maps says it is.  
  
  
As far as interests, Im into outdoorsy stuff like hiking, rock climbing, and parks. I like to spend evenings seeing live music, bar trivia, board game nights, etc. Im also hoping to start dating in the area too, is it mostly college students who move away in summers or is there a young professional mix?  
  
  
Im coming from straight suburbia in the north, which is fine since I have a friend group up there, but I think it would be hard to move to that kind of sleepy family town area without any friends.  
  
  
so /r/Princeton , does it sound like I would like living in around here? Any other suggestions on places to live?",0.1814511575381141,0.5028985507246376,Princeton

366,Princeton University Burnout,1,2020-09-29 17:14:11,8,"I am a first year student who is worried they might fail their first semester. 

I am not particularly hell-bent on getting all As, but I am currently failing two classes and am on the verge of failing another. I am pretty sure I have undiagnosed ADHD/executive function disorder, and I am going currently untreated for GAD. I seem to start assignments and cannot continue studying for more than 10 minutes at a time, after that I begin actively seeking distractions (napping, online browsing, cooking, chores etc). Additionally, I struggle to remember quantitative material, which makes my STEM courses particularly difficult to understand as most derivations are initially too difficult for me to understand. I think I would be able to focus or pass my classes if I maybe had one or two classes with no precepts or labs. 

What i've currently been doing to minimize my burnout has not been working. I stay in regular contact with my DSL, but I do not interact in any with my RCA or PAA as I genuinely do not enjoy my previous interactions with them or my advisory groups. I have been looking for a therapist to for my GAD for the past 8 weeks and I do not have my first appointment with them until after midterms. I am increasing the amount of times I go to office hours, but I notice for some of my classes that I do not have questions for my professors during office hours because they went over the material I am lost on over a week ago. I currently have a McGraw tutor in one of the classes I am not failing, but the limited amount of time does not allow me to learn the material in the way I need to actually retain it. I find it difficult to study regularly throughout the week, either I will spend 7+ hours of pomodoro method studying or I will do nothing all day. 

Has anyone else struggled this much with online learning, and is their anything I can do to  get my grades under control now? This current way of studying is unsustainable, and I am not of privilege to be able to take a gap year or defer in the future. I love what I am studying and I love my support system, I am simply unable to do online school at the present moment and would love to take a break or get it together so I don't feel like i'm drowning.",0.05129251700680273,0.43744549101691954,Princeton

When we go through the news, we see that people are suffering around the globe with a lack of essential things like water, food, etc. How would that feel like?

Now... we all yearn for success and we want to be happy. Why not make that person on the other side of the globe smile while you may not know them. That smile on their face from your contribution can result in something 'big' in your life unexpectedly. It could also result in your university success. That's powerful.

Many of us are struggling financially, but what if we can donate just $1 for the wellbeing of another person. Imagine how many families praying for your wellbeing during a crisis relief while you're doing an assignment. Maybe you might just figure out the answer quickly :) Don't belittle the $1. If 100 students can donate $1 out of goodness, then that $100 that can save plenty of lives/ families.
