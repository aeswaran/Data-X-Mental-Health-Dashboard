### IEOR 135 / 290: Applied Data Science with Venture Applications


# Data-X-Mental-Health-Dashboard
 
This repository contains all code notebooks used to create a mental health dashboard analyzing 16 different U.S. universities.

## 📁 About The Project

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our world has shifted everyone’s day to day activities to online platforms. With the increased number of hours sitting in front of technology and limited face-to-face interactions, numerous mental health concerns have emerged. Driven to action, a group of four UC Berkeley students, set out to create an interactive tool that provides an analytical visual of mental health trends for various public and private universities across the nation. The project aims to provide a snapshot of mental health status among college students and track changes in prevalence of mental health issues by using anonymized Reddit data.

The team hopes that their studies of mental health through social media encourages current psychologists, scientists and other researchers to be able to conduct longitudinal studies of mental health past COVID-19, potentially involving studies of different demographics such as children and the elderly. They aim to utilize their results as evidence for potential policy implementation and revision at large universities like UC Berkeley, where the lives of numerous students are at stake and at the discretion of higher authorities who make decisions that can impact student wellbeing.


## 💡 What's inside the folders
-**Web Scraping Code for Data Collection :** 
 To efficiently collect data, our team used a python notebook with web scraping code. The notebook can be found in this folder. To get specific posts from each university, our team changed the subreddit thread according to each university, and the before and after UNIX codes using data conversions.


-**Final Interactive Dashboard :**

This folder contains the csvs used in our final interactive dashboard, as well as the notebook containing the interactive graphs. To see the dashboard locally, users can upload the notebook and accompanying csv files into datahub. The notebook has also been deployed to a permanent link using Heroku, and can be found here: http://covid19-social-media-trends.herokuapp.com/
