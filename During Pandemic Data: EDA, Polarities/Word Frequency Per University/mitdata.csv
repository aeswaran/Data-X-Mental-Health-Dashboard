25,Late change to grading,1,2020-03-07 20:22:28,1,"[form](https://imgur.com/a/4jGqNwR)
I figured out the housing situation that I posted about last week (thank you guys for the advice). Now that I’m registered, I want to change the grading for one of my classes to pnr but the deadline was yesterday. (I got approved by the course instructor to change the grading yesterday, I just forgot to submit the changes to the registrar.) Now I have to submit a late change form (see picture). I don’t really know how I’m supposed to answer the questions (or rather, how they want me to answer the questions), especially the last one.

I suppose with the first one, I can just explain that I wasn’t able to register until very late, but “why should you be allowed to change the status of this subject after the deadline” is a question that I have no clue how to answer. I don’t really know how they want me to answer it—should I explain that I don’t feel I’ll get the grade I want or what? I’m not really sure how to convince them that I should be allowed to. Or am I just being overly worried and it’s likely they won’t care what I write there?

Did anyone here have to submit a late form and if so, how did you answer the questions? I don’t see myself passing this class with flying colors and I’d really like to change it.",-0.0040476190476190456,0.4924206349206349,ucla

With the declaration of a state of emergency by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the doubling of Covid-19 cases in the Greater Boston area, the Institute is increasingly concerned for the safety of the community and is therefore taking extraordinary steps.

First, we are cancelling all classes tomorrow, Friday, March 13. This decision was made after consultation with Academic Council, the faculty officers, and MIT Medical.

We are also strongly advising all undergraduate students to accelerate their move out plans. MIT will reimburse travel change expenses and new reservation costs up to $500 for undergraduates who move up their departure to before Sunday, March 15 at midnight. Additional resources for an accelerated move out, including free pick up and storage of belongings, can be found here.

80,Biochem Tutoring Help,1,2020-03-15 17:17:35,0,"I have a problem set due at 9pm that's released at 6pm. I go to another college. If someone is good at the CMP regulation, please pm/email me at [biochemtutoring123@gmail.com](mailto:biochemtutoring123@gmail.com). I can pay you very well. One example question we were given is about what will happen to the CMP in biosynthetic conditions? 

The answer we were given is here: We are in biosynthetic conditions. This means we are using something smaller (in this case citrate) and using that to build something larger (in this case fatty acids). For biosynthetic conditions to even be active it implies we have a much higher amount of ATP because ATP positively regulates biosynthetic pathways. Since we have high ATP that means have a lot of our products for the ETC and therefore ATP synthase will get inhibited. If we inhibit ATP synthase this means that we have nothing to dissipate our pH gradient and therefore it will become too unfavorable for the ETC to continue to pump protons against its concentration gradient and therefore the ETC also will shutdown. This will then cause a build-up of the substrates of the ETC, one of which is NADH. Now, that you have high amounts of NADH and ATP, they will together go and inhibit the irreversible steps of the TCA cycle.However, this is where it gets a bit complicated and why you need to remember the bigger picture (and this will answer your second question). Yes, NADH and ATP will both inhibit the irreversible steps of the TCA as well as ATP inhibiting both PFK and PK in glycolysis. However, remember that you are also removing citrate to produce fatty acids. Even though citrate synthase is being inhibited by NADH and ATP, if we keep removing citrate you would eventually get to a really really low concentration of citrate and therefore it will pull forward that reaction even though citrate synthase is also being inhibited (remember our bigger picture is that we need to keep being able to produce citrate to remove it to make fatty acids so that's what is happening here as well). Same thing happens for glycolysis. Since we keep removing acetyl-CoA to make citrate, and pyruvate to make acetyl-coA, and so on, the rest of glycolysis will also be pulled forward even though we are inhibiting many of its enzymes. So there wouldn't be an accumulation of glycolytic intermediates again because they are being broken down to form more citrate so we can ultimately make more fatty acids.",0.058643845866068085,0.47553123830901617,ucla

96,DIY Ventilators: Can the Medialab help?,1,2020-03-18 17:58:15,9,"

A call for help: 

Has anyone considered using a raspberry pi or other microcontroller to hack something like a CPAP machine or other pressurized air device (like SCUBA gear) to make a DIY ventilator? This could save a lot of lives. Our current supply is in the thousands, not enough by far. 

As a healthcare provider, the settings we adjust are: inspiration/expiration pressure, volume of air delivered, and ratio of inhale/exhale times. Some people require oxygen to be added. 
Patients who are incubated are sedated so they generally have no respiratory drive at all. 

BTW: CPAP is continuous positive airway pressure, which helps those who stop breathing during sleep and they have adjustments for pressure only. 

Please share this with other maker communities as we need to think outside the box.

130,MIT in person commencement cancelled,1,2020-03-24 15:05:23,13,"Letter from Reif today:
To the members of the MIT community,

The day before I was set to graduate from my Caracas high school, the city suffered a major earthquake. Buildings collapsed. There were serious casualties. Suddenly, it was impossible, physically and emotionally, to hold the traditional graduation ceremony we had all been counting on. 

I still remember the pain and disappointment – so I write with special sympathy and great regret to let you know that, in a world so disrupted by Covid-19, it is clear we cannot conduct our traditional in-person celebration of Commencement, Hooding and Tech Reunions in late May. 

To the Class of 2020 and all of our graduating students, to your proud families and faculty friends, and to our reunion-year alumni: I know you have been holding out hope that the recognition you have earned might still be presented in the usual way. We have all been hoping. So I expect this news may be sharply disappointing.

But I promise you, we are going to reinvent these wonderful rituals to honor and celebrate with you, in the best MIT spirit, in ways that make sense in this most unusual time.

Getting the details right will be important, and we know you will have questions; as plans develop, we will share updated information with everyone affected. (And if you already ordered regalia, you will receive a follow-up communication.) 

For now, here are the broad strokes:

To honor the incredible hard work and accomplishments of our graduating students, Commencement 2020 will occur in two parts: 

An online event on May 29 to confer degrees and to celebrate our graduates. Those who plan our usual Commencement will co-design this program with our elected student leaders and some faculty.
An in-person celebration, to be held at MIT at some point in the future. The students, faculty and staff on our Commencement Transition Committee – whom we charged to develop the programming for MIT Commencement in 2021 and beyond – will begin imagining the possibilities for this special Class of 2020 event, under the leadership of committee chair Professor Jim Poterba and bolstered by new student leaders. Proposing that graduates travel back to campus naturally raises questions around equity and financial burdens, so we will do our best to plan with these concerns in mind.
To our graduating students: If you have ideas for these events, please share them with us and your elected student leaders at CommencementIdeas@mit.edu.

Although 2020 Tech Reunions will not occur as they usually would, once we understand the larger circumstances more fully, we will explore ways to honor class milestones and bring the community together again. I am especially grateful to the many class leaders whose energetic outreach – over many years, and in distinctive ways in this challenging time – continues to keep classmates connected to each other and to the great global family of MIT.

If you were planning to attend Reunions, the MIT Alumni Association will be in touch soon to help you navigate these changes.

*   *   *

As the Covid-19 crisis unfolds, you will continue to hear from us – a lot. We are trying to learn what works best in terms of frequency and channels, and we hope to find the right path between “too much” and “not enough.” We will convey practical updates, and we will honor the human stories.

For now, I will simply say that what I most remember from that long-ago earthquake is the people around me – family, neighbors, teachers, friends – shaken to the core, but pulling together to help, with remarkable generosity, fortitude and kindness. 

Those memories echo exactly what I have seen at MIT through the upheaval of these past weeks: students, staff, postdocs and faculty adjusting rapidly to this disconcerting new reality and doing everything they can to help each other and contribute to the greater public good.

In this difficult situation, the people of MIT have already endured and accomplished a great deal. The weeks and months ahead may hold harder challenges. From what I have seen, I have every expectation that our community will meet those new challenges with the same patience, courage, selflessness and grace.

May you all stay safe and well.

Sincerely,

If it helps -- I'm going in as a pure math major and likely pre-MD/PhD. If I go to Brown, I would likely double major in bio/math. I thrive on challenge and being with people who do, but I'm trying to balance that w/ pre-med requirements. 

I'm quite social/extroverted and enjoy parties now and then, but I don't plan to drink much (and hope to be at a school where that's okay). I'm a pretty driven/focused person, and I like to be around people who are similar in that way (but collaborative more than competitive). I think ""social nerd"" describes me pretty well, though I'm not super nerdy.

MIT -- **Pros:** What drew me here is the fact that everyone is super driven and wants to make a difference, and research is great. I've made a bunch of friends already and feel like I would fit in very well with the community. I love the idea of having pset parties late into the night on whiteboards and talking about random cool math problems, even if they aren't related to class. **Cons:** I'm worried about the workload, sleep, and mental health, especially since I won't be able to place out of any classes there (my school is not very academic and doesn't offer APs). I also don't know how much time I'd have for extracurriculars.

Brown -- **Pros:** I love the open curriculum. There isn't grade deflation so pre-med might be easier. It also seems like it would be less stressful than MIT, and I could test into higher-level courses. The people seem quite humble and very friendly. **Cons:** I'm worried that I might not find ""my people"" in the same way/the community might not be as good of a fit. At my current HS, I've sometimes felt like it was hard to connect with classmates bc they had very different interests than me. I'm pretty clear this wouldn't be an issue at MIT, not convinced about Brown. I also don't know how strong the pure math program is/what research is like.

I had the amazing privilege of being accepted into these four schools, and given that there is no possible way I will be able to visit any of them before committing, I was hoping to gain a bit more insight into MIT, undergraduate research, and its culture before I decide.

I am interested in studying some combination of Computer Science, Economics/Finance and Linguistics - I still do not know what I will major in. I will in all probability go to grad school to earn a Ph.D. before making any further career choices (thinking of either going into academia or algorithmic trading, really unsure here). 

My main concern at the moment is research opportunities - some of the other schools I got into are undergraduate-focused, and from what I have read so far, I think that means I do not need to compete with graduate students for selective research opportunities. At MIT, I know about UROPs, but I wanted to know how difficult it is for undergraduates to get UROP positions at labs like CSAIL. For those of you who went on to go to grad school in any of these fields, were there any advantages or disadvantages that you felt present between you and other candidates while applying that were a direct result of the opportunities you got at MIT? Would you have done anything different (from a research perspective) if you could redo it? How do you think research stacks up here vs the other schools? Were you able to develop good enough relationships with your professors that helped you out for grad school?

I am also interested in your experiences in economics and/or finance at MIT. What do you think about the programs offered here versus the ones offered at the other schools? Again, what was your experience with the teaching and research here? If post-graduation, I were to change tracks from academia and opt for an MBA instead, do you think I will face any significant advantages/disadvantages?

Finally campus culture. Those of you who made this (or a similar decision), or who were able to visit campuses before deciding - what swung you in favor of wherever you study currently? I am kind of a quiet introvert, not much into parties and outdoor life, but as I will be living alone in a new country, I am concerned about mental health on these campuses, and how socializing works there. 

Other factors that I am thinking of - experience in classes (quality of teaching), dorm/floor culture (feel free to mention your experiences in any specific dorms, not looking at FSILGs as of now), food and dining, weather, exposure to cultural experiences (please include the rest of Boston in this - if I am going to any of these schools then I will be looking to explore the arts scene in the neighboring areas too), and anything else you feel should be an important contributing factor to my decision.

161,[Prefrosh] Is MIT really a 24/7 Grind???,1,2020-04-01 17:32:36,30,"Hi! 

I was recently admitted to MIT (I'm beyond thrilled!) and I am currently deciding between it and another school. Pretty much my main concern is... MIT is hard (duh). 

But...I've heard rumors that it's like a 24/7 grind, that there's a lot of stress culture, that it's REALLY hard to get a decent GPA (I want to go to grad school) and most students don't have time for clubs or research. 

I want to know if that's really true, because frankly, I know MIT's academics are literally world class and I love academic rigor and being challenged which is why I applied, but \*\*TOO MUCH\*\* stress culture isn't appealing to me and it freaks me out. 

Another rumor I heard was that professors aren't really available for students like at office hours etc because they assume everyone is self motivated. Are these things true?? Because I'm the type of student who thrives off being able to stay after class, clarify stuff with the professors, chat with them, and I don't want to come off as annoying if that's the case :(

I'm a hard worker, but not the type of student who is used to studying 24/7. I mean, I get my work done in a reasonable time frame and I'm pretty organized but for tests I do most of my studying by  ""cramming"". Am I going to need to become one of those people who invests 3 hours of studying a day?? because yikes.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to be lazy, it's just that I have a very particular work-life balance where I leave plenty of time for productive side-projects like web design, sewing, and research, as well as extracurricular activities, community service, exercise etc.

In college, I really want to have enough time to engage in entrepreneurship activities, research, and other things to keep my mental wellbeing in check, while still being able to balance academics and not get 150% overwhelmed.

168,MIT vs. Princeton,1,2020-04-02 17:15:03,10,"Hello,

I’ve been blessed to be admitted to these two amazing schools this past week. The majors I had listed were math and philosophy, although I have no idea what I *really* want to major in (possibly finance/economics/AI/CS). I have been doing a lot of research lately and have been asking alumnis/current students/experts about their opinions. Quite frankly, I was surprised to know that around equal amounts of votes have been cast for both schools for varying reasons. Similarly, my favor for one school over another has been alternating everyday as well! I am really torn and would like to ask more people why I should choose one school over another. It is insanely difficult to choose because I’ve never visited campus and now I can’t go to revisit day due to the pandemic.

A little bit about myself. I am an Asian female. I’m a pretty well-balanced student between STEM and humanities. Disclaimer: I am not a huge STEM fanatic although I do enjoy math (I still think I want to major in STEM at the end because it is more profitable and I’m not significantly better in humanities anyways). However, I’d imagine that my STEM skills would not nearly be on par as all the other MIT STEM kids. I am also not a huge nerd either but I do like learning things.

**MIT**

 Pros:

&amp;#x200B;

* LOVE the Boston area (close to Harvard, close to the city)
* BIG party school (more fun)
* Collaborative environment (people work together rather than against each other)
* Nice people/culture (dorm system makes it easier to find groups and just integrate in general)
* Probably looks better for employment if I major in STEM since it is, after all, “MIT” (especially if I major in math, Princeton might be equally difficult anyways since math is most difficult major at Princeton but MIT is still “MIT”)

Cons:

&amp;#x200B;

* Notorious workload (although I have read that it is manageable as long as I find a balance between course-load + EC’s)
* Difficulty of STEM classes, specifically intro classes (i.e. I’ve read somewhere that intro classes tend to be insanely difficult because professors try to cater classes for IMO/math olympiad geniuses which are a majority of the kids who go to MIT)
* Maybe slightly more difficult than Princeton although both are known as insanely difficult schools
* Not as diverse in terms of interests as Princeton students

**Princeton**

Pros:

&amp;#x200B;

* I am unsure what I want to major in yet and someone advised me that Princeton may be the better option if I am still not set on what to major/do in the future
* Exceptional undergrad experience (I’ve read in a lot of websites that I should go to Princeton undergrad and maybe MIT for grad since Princeton has the best undergrad education in the country)
* Receive well-balanced education (best education for humanities and STEM). I think this is pretty important given that life after all, is interdisciplinary

Cons: 

&amp;#x200B;

* Known to be white, elitist, and cliquey. I’d imagine it to be pretty cliquey, preppy, and overall less accepting than MIT culture socially. This may be a stereotype but I am afraid that it will overall be a pretentious and exclusive social atmosphere. I am also afraid that not joining the eating clubs may be socially detrimental.
* More competitive and cut-throat among students, and less fun in terms of partying
* The Princeton town &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Boston although I know it is closer to NY

I guess to sum things up, I am more attracted to MIT’s social scene and culture while Princeton’s academic experience seems more appealing to me. I know I really can’t go wrong with these options, but I want to still choose the “better” school for me.",0.08015350877192984,0.5173245614035091,ucla

I’m currently a sophomore in high school in Florida, and lately I’ve been in the mood of thinking about college and all that stuff.

Anyways, given that I'm auditioning against returning members and really talented people, do I stand a chance if I can play an acceptable 3-octave major scale ;) ? 

I love classical music so I really hope I can get in.

Any insight into the audition process/MITSO in general/MIT music program in general would be very very appreciated &lt;3",0.183828125,0.5148958333333334,ucla

If we can take a video stream, and somehow modulate it, manipulated in a way that we can see it while having our eyes closed, that would be awesome.  This would mean that the blinded can now see.

I finished with a Course 15 degree about a decade ago. 

In my first 2 years at the institute, I really wanted to graduate in 8 and/or 18 then go to grad school for a PhD, but I had such an inferiority complex which heavily affected my class performance and GPA. Compared to my peers, I came in very unprepared but that didn't mean that there were no resources that could've helped me catch up. 15 is great and can be very rigorous, but I chose it (and an ""easy"" course schedule) out of fear of failing out. 

In my last two years, I thought I'd go into IB or Consulting but I discovered very late that I was also totally unprepared for and unenthusiastic about that too. I figured that if I weren't going to grad school, I might as well try to make a lot of money. Sadly, neither of those things happened.

Now I work as a admin for a university. It helps pay the bills but I'd really like to go back to school. I'm working on this new goal now but with the pandemic going on, I and my team might end up getting laid off soon.

Despite all this, I look back at MIT fondly. I had a lot of fun there, made some unforgettable memories and met some amazing individuals. I really miss Cambridge and Boston too.

If you are uncomfortable with me using your computer, i can show you the instructions online if you would like to do it yourself. I don't think it would take longer than 10 minutes or so and most of that time would just be the download. If you are able/willing to help, please post here and i can pm you my number or you can just tell me where and when you would like to meet. Thanks in advance for any help.",0.25,0.6,ucla

274,Admitted student choosing between UDelaware and MIT,1,2020-04-24 06:22:49,26,"Hi all! I'm a high school senior who's currently deciding between University of Delaware and MIT for chemical engineering. Everyone around me says I'm completely crazy for choosing UD, but I think I have my reasons, I just don't know how valid they are. Before getting into the details, I'll say money is not an issue, I have not been on either campus and I did not actually participate in CP\* at all (kind of regret it but I truly thought MIT wasn't right for me then).

So far I kind of have these arguments for MIT as my parents/friends/current students/third aunt idk tell me: 

* interesting people, will motivate me much more than those even in UD honors
* workload made easier by ""shared suffering"" and collaboration (my high school was kind of like this as a STEM boarding school so I can kind of understand how this can be good)
* resources, connections, prestige (yes everyone mentions this when they talk about me not choosing MIT I don't know how much this really matters, probably more than I think ?)

My gripes about MIT that prevented me from considering it much: 

* WORK - I was a complete nerd last yr in 11th grade and studied for an olympiad possibly avg 5 hrs/day. It was fulfilling in the end but I realized it's definitely not how I want to live life. I couldn't do any hobbies, meet new people, gym, meditate/read for fun/try new things/be happier/etc, and so this year I stopped doing as much schoolwork (took only blowoff classes). I care about chemistry a lot still, it's just I don't want to be stuck studying all the time when (and this is how I perceive it) I could be at UD doing the same thing while actually becoming a better person. I really value my free time now and I think MIT would just kill it so fast
* I have a pipe dream of becoming a high school chemistry teacher (if I ever become extremely patient/talkative/understanding with time) and MIT's prestige doesn't mean anything here (?)
* Also may have a little impostor syndrome lmao but I don't think this is really big

I guess I realized that if I can get in a relaxed schedule, MIT is fine, but I think people have deluded me into thinking ""your life is so easy if you take the bare minimum, everyone at MIT overloads themselves!"" So my questions are

1. For a single-major ChemE, how possible is an average schedule of 8-9 hrs sleep/day, 1-2 hrs hw, 2 hrs non-academic hobby, 1 hr reading for fun, 1 hr gym? I might be completely crazy - is this possible at UD or similar? 
2. How reasonable am I with my reasons for not wanting to go to MIT?

Thank you :)",0.18651578813343525,0.5799471606824548,ucla

i'm an english student just finishing my last year of high school. i have another two years of sixth form to go before joining a uni or a college and, seeing as i want to study physics, i've been considering MIT as an option.

i was just wondering if anybody had any advice or information they could give me about applying to MIT, and does it have any advantages of staying in england to study at oxbridge? half of me wants to stay in england just because it's a lot more affordable than colleges in america. how easy is it to go about finding scholarships and affordable accommodation? also, is there anything specific i could start doing now in lockdown that could increase my chances of getting in here or somewhere similar?

280,Help a super stressed out student decide- Yale vs MIT,1,2020-04-25 12:27:06,10,"So  I already made a post about this before, but felt like I needed the  input of others before I make a decision. I was admitted to Columbia,  Princeton, Yale, and MIT, and I am intending to study computer science  and economics. While this post is mainly meant for Yale and MIT, I am  still considering the others if you think one of them fits me more.

I'm  aware that these are both incredible institutions, so if you guys know  these universities, I would love it if you advised me mainly based on  fit, and the perceived culture on campus.

Here are a few things about me:

\-  I'm pretty academically well-rounded. I like math and science, but I  also LOVE the humanities. I enjoy writing essays where there is no wrong  answer as long as it's backed up.

\- My fascination with technology mainly comes from the things you can do with it (i.e. application)

\-  I feel that my main strengths are in speech and debate (did a lot of  MUN in HS). I am pretty politically engaged, and I would love to be in a  campus that is similar.

\-I am not  sure that computer science is my life's passion with ultimate  certainty, and later down the road I would much rather have an  executive/leadership role in a company than be a software engineer

\-  I am also a big fan of entrepreneurship, business, and economics, and  would love to take these as either a joint or secondary major. I am  interested in startups and would love to start one in college.

\-I am interested in a more collaborative atmosphere, rather than one that has toxic competition

\-I  am an extrovert- my favorite activities to do on a weekend are social. I  typically go out to town or party, but I am also interested in doing  similar social things on campus.

\-I  would personally prefer an urban environment like that of MIT or  Columbia rather than a suburban/smaller urban one like Yale or Princeton

\-  I'm also scared that the academic rigor of an institution like MIT will  make me hate my major more than an institution like Yale, especially  since I see myself much more as a founder/CEO with a tech background,  rather than a software engineer.

Also  as an aside, I still haven't received my financial aid package from  Yale. Do you guys think I should request an extension since I am  seriously considering it?",0.14801587301587302,0.4583900226757369,ucla

Please add your own suggestions!

&amp;#x200B;

* Cambridge Based
   * Five Spice | $$
      * Best and closest mala xian guo place near MIT. The food there is great and the price is very affordable. My go-to place for a long lunch during the day due to its proximity.
   * Mysterious White Food Truck Area 4 | $ - $$
      * It's shady but it's good. I don't know how they make it so good but the food truck parks right in front of Area 4 most days and there is always a line. It is a fast, cheap, delicious way to keep your stomach full especially if you have a tight schedule.
   * L'Verdes | $
      * Will fill you up. Will also take away your soul. Atleast if you get 10 subs they give you a free one.
   * Anna's Tacqueria | $ - $$
      * Is food. Will fill up stomach. Tastes decent I guess. Not a big fan of this kinda of food myself. Alot of people get it nevertheless. Good if you don't have time for anything else.
   * Thelonious Monkfish | $$ - $$$
      * Very expensive. It has sushi boats, fish dons and etc. Good place to bring your date. Wouldn't really go casually tho.
   * HMart Go Go Curry | $$
      * Amazing curry. It is fast, tastes good, and is in HMART so you'll be able to pick up snacks along the way.
   * HMart Sakura Ramen | $$
      * Same thing as Harambe curry. Closest ramen place to campus
   * Dumpling Daughters | $$
      * Pretty good asian food. I appreciate how clean it is and how efficient they make your food.  I like the food but it does not remind me of the stuff I normally eat, esp since alot of the stuff is premade.
   * Chipotle | $ - $$
   * Area 4 | $$
      * Good pizza place(heard from others). It is very close to campus. Never been there myself though.
   * The Smokeshop | $$
      * I really like their smoked meats and their sauce. The price is a little bit on the higher side but it definitely a change of taste compared to the other restaurants named here. I personally think it is worth it.
   * The Friendly Toast | $ - $$
      * A really friendly breakfast diner that makes amazing comfort food. 
   * Roxy's | $$
      * A close-by grilled cheese joint with great tots. I would personally think it is a lil overpriced esp the tomato soup but the taste definitely makes up for it.
   * Oath's | $$
      * Make your own pizza. Never enjoyed it but it is a good eat once in a while.
   * Saloniki's | $ - $$
      * Amazing pitas at this greek restaurant. It is probably as close to campus as you can get. The food is cheap and amazing. Students get free fries if shown ID.
   * Taco Bell  | $
      * \+1 rep for taste, -1 rep for diarrhea
   * Helmand  | $$ - $$$
      * Kinda expensive Afghan restaurants. Their lamb is amazing and I would definitely suggest trying here.
   * Pepper Sky | $$
      * Amazing Thai food. Although I never went there personally, ever club orders it for events.
   * McDonalds | $ - $$
      * Only for late-night shenanigans
   * Dumpling House | $$
      * Amazing Asian restaurant that is also very cheap. Comparable to 5 spice although I think Dumpling house is a little bit better. The only downside is its really up Mass Ave(closer to Harvard than MIT)
   * 430 Tavern | $$
      * Go here for Boston dine out week. The steak tip lunch is amazing, the meat is perfectly tender and the asparagus is amazingly seasoned.
* Boston Based
   * Santouka  | $$
      * The best ramen you'll find near campus. It is a 20 minute walk over the bridge. The line is very long so prepare for a wait. Do make sure to go in duos or by yourself since larger groups take longer to seat. (There is another one in Harvard that will seat you faster). Go here on a date lol
   * Kaju Tofu | $$
      * Amazing tofu soup place. My go-to place to eat when I'm in Boston. Definitely try this place out. Always get an egg in your soup.
   * Hsin Hsin's | $(lunch menu) - $$
      * Really cheap asian food that will give you diabetes or cancer. It tastes good but eat at your own risk.
   * Chef Chang | ?
      * Apparently the noodles are good? Never been before
   * Love Art Sushi | $$
      * Make your own sushi don place. It also offers hand rolls. I ate it a lot over the summer. The price is pretty affordable even with UROP pay.
   * Pad Thai Cafe | $ - $$
      * One of my favorite pad thai places I been to. I like the Indonesian Fried Rice alot. They give you alot of food compared to what you pay.
   * Wendy's | $ - $$
      * I love Wendy's chili's and baconator. What can I say.
   * Boston Burger Company | $$
      * Amazing burgers! Most of the burgers are very fatty and greasy and is impossible to fit in your mouth but it is soooo good. If you go at 4:20, the 420 burger(literally obesity burger) only costs 4.20.
   * Pour House | ?
      * ??? people I know always want to go so it must be good right???
   * Peach Farm | $$
      * Decent asian food place. Not sure if its worth the price since there are so many others which are better.
   * Dumpling Palace | $ - $$
      * This is the one on Mass Ave. The food is really bad. Go there if you're drunk and need to fill up your stomach
   * Haruka Ramen | $$
      * Outwayed by Santouka. It's not a proper ramen place since it also sells other noodles. Overall the quality is not that good. Source: my mom
   * Gourmet Dumpling House | $$
      * There is usually a long wait. The food is really good here especially the dumplings and xiao long bao. Would suggest going here, maybe on a date
   * Taiwan Cafe | $$
      * Can't actually remember much. It is average asian food. Nothing too particular but nothing too bad.
   * Dumpling Cafe | $$
      * Also average asian food. 
   * Double Chin | $$
      * I've only been here once. The food was okay. I went with my gf and I never thought about going back. If invited I would go back but I wouldn't go out of my own choice. Wasn't too memorable
   * Penang | $$
      * I always liked Penang even at home. I like the shrimp noodles but it is definitely an average restaurant taste wise.
   * Pho Pasteur | $$
      * Argued to be the best pho place in Boston. greatly debated
   * Pho Basil | $$
      * On Mass Ave. Another Pho place but this one is closer to campus. The food is good, especially if you want Viet food. The distance to campus is a plus but the taste is a bit lower than Pho Pasteur.
   * Hei La Moon | $$
      * Great dim sum place. Go here with a group and you'll have fun.
   * Tora Japanese Restaurant | $$
      * Amazing sushi/fish don. I discovered this by accident and it is a kinda small and in the ground. But don't be deceived. It is very clean inside and the taste is A1.
   * Quic Pic BBQ | $ - $$
      * I came here when I was hungry late at night after a haircut and the food is decent. It has cha sao(bbq pork). I liked it and am willing to go back again.
   * 5 Spices House | $$
      * Have you ever play Angry Bird's lite? Well 5 spice in Cambridge is angry birds and this 5 spice is pretty much the same thing but as that 5 spice. I would go to the other one though.
   * Ruckus | $$
      * Surprisingly a ramen place. The price is a lil high for what you get. I don't plan on going there again. The taste was not WOW! enough for me to remember too much.
* Allston Based
   * Bonchon | $$
      * Best fried chicken in Boston. Definitely go here once in your life
   * Dumpling Kingdom | $ - $$
      * Very average asian restaurant. Probably shouldn't go since there are wayyy better options
   * Kaju Tofu | $$
      * See above Kaju. Same thing, small differences in menu
   * Seoul Soulongtang | $$
      * Beef bone soup. Good to warming up on a cold day but I do feel like it is a bit bland.
   * Tasty Pot | $$
      * Amazing food. I really like this place and I try to come as much as I can. It is basically hot pot that they precook and most of it is spicy. 
   * Coreanos $ - $$
      * Korean/Mexican fusion. It is a very interesting taste but pretty good nevertheless
   * Le's Vietnamese Cuisine | $$
      * Taste isn't much better than the other Pho restaurants. It is too far to be noted.
   * Gyu Kaku | $$ - $$$
      * Best thing about this place is the unlimited KBBQ. Eat as much as you can! There is alot of meat and the taste is amazing! If you like meat definitely go here.

* Kung Fu Tea
   * Down Mass Ave near Symphony, most convenient place. If you join ASA you get a discount
* Gong Cha
   * In chinatown, my favorite place in Boston
* Chatime
   * It is good only if Gong Cha is closed since Gong Cha is just accross the street
* Teado
   * Cheap bubble tea, most clubs order from here for fundraisers
* Royal Tea
   * I think the price is a little bit higher than others. The taste is definitely unique. 

Also check out the bakeries in Chinatown! They are amazing, I love raisin bread and egg tart. Also Kalai has haircuts for $13 dollars. They do a great job at cutting hair although there always is a wait.

300,MIT Admissions Blogger,1,2020-04-29 03:38:26,2,"I'm a senior, and I've always secretly wanted to become a blogger once I got to MIT. I was always too scared to do so, because I've never posted anything I've ever written on the internet, and I didn't feel ready. I've also been pretty busy with classes/UROPs so far in my undergraduate career, so I never ended up applying to become a blogger.

However, quarantine has filled me with an urge to write more, and I thought that maybe next year I could apply to become a blogger (assuming the urge doesn't disappear). My questions to the bloggers and mainly to Chris Peterson are:

1) How competitive are the blogger applications each year? And if I don't have an existent body of writing work, or any sort of online presence (I don't), do I stand a chance? And if I'm a pretty boring person with a pretty uneventful life, do I stand a chance?

2) How much of a time commitment is blogging (apart from the time dedicated to actually writing stuff)? Here I'm mostly thinking about stuff like blogger meetings, other admissions events, etc. that the bloggers are expected to participate in.

3) Is there a lower bound on the number of posts that a blogger must write per semester?",0.07598039215686274,0.5769607843137255,ucla

I know MIT is generally a really collaborative environment, but there's a stereotype of finance majors elsewhere being snaky, competitive, or too focused on networking to make real connections. Do you find this to be true at MIT?

I've seen jokes made about people at Sloan and am wondering whether that's just a joke or whether there's actually some real resentment between Sloanies and not-Sloanies. If so, do you feel that it's justified?

Do you find that the relative smartness of people here and the difficulty of the courses make it harder to find career opportunities?

How popular are econ/finance at MIT? I'm also considering somewhere where finance is a lot more popular. What are the pros/cons of MIT's department size?

I don't know why but whenever MIT comes to my mind, it just makes my heart hurt so badly. I am living in Afghanistan willing to do anything to get in, because...    only because it feels like a family. 

sorry for interrupting but I only wanted to put my feeling out somewhere because if I don't, they will explode in my mind leaving me in very bad depression.

The story is that when I came back from Iran ( a really great country) for my father's job, I was OK with the situation. However, it was not a good decision by a long shot.  I lost my friends, didn't get any in the middle school that I went in Afghanistan, my classmates were jealous for the grades I was getting ( really poor education system compared to Iran's, so that helped me to look better there), they just bullied me so much, and even they tried 4 times to throw me out of the school. I just had a formal conversation with them all and nothing more.

# BUT

After passing 3 hard tests  I got the chance to get in "" the best school of the Afghanistan""  for free...EVERYTHING changed for good. 

I mean like everything. the most amazing part was when I found out instead of student counselor in the school, for each class of the school we had a person called 'older brother'. We could go to here ask about anything. Because I was too young (an 8 grader at that time), and went to another city to study, I couldn't see my family, so I always cried on his shoulder. It helped me a lot. being a 13-year-old boy I didn't know how to chose any friend and stuff so I always asked him for advice. He always said don't be scared and look for someone passionate.

 back then Didn't know Why he was saying that and why it was related to passion. But now it all makes sense, I have friends that are willing to die for me and its the most amazing feeling to have support on your side. I am a high school graduate now and I am in contact with them and will be forever. MIT gives me the same feeling. from far here it feels like a piece of me is missing. DONT WANT TO SHOW IT TO DRAMATIC but its the truth. 

REST IN PEACE OLDER  BROTHER

HOWEVER, the data in the MIT site shows that it will be nearly impossible for me to get in and feel loved again. I really want to make a change in my peoples' hearts here in Afghanistan too. Hopefully, I will slip through that 0.01 percent of the possibility of getting accepted.

I will apply this year, and I really want to get in so to anyone who read till this very end THANKS A MILLION it means a lot to me and wishes me luck.

He's literally donated $1.1 billion to create this College of Computing that no students are benefitting from at the moment. Another gross privilege of MIT pandering to faculty and not students.

But regardless why should we name a key college in our university off a man who supports Trump who has separated children from families, fear-mongered, encouraged racism in our country and overseen a national pandemic? I think they should change the name.

I mean we already have buildings named after the Koch brothers etc. Is it moral or the ""MIT way"" for MIT to be built on the dollars of billionaires who are so ethically questionable? I mean it's certainly not the Jeffrey Dahmer College of Computing or anything, but I think MIT should petition against this.

I honestly don't even know what more they wanted from me (I guess my GPA wasn't the best - 3.6 EECS at top 10 eng. school, but hear me out lol). 

I founded a long distance ride-sharing startup freshmen year and got like 15,000 miles covered through our platform in under 2 months. We were the youngest team to compete for the annual entrepreneurship event at our Uni (irrelevant but had press from news outlets such as fox news lol).

I had also built a Brain Computer Interface (the username lmao) that could detect with \~70% accuracy the music you're listening to with just your real-time brain signals.

As far as credibility goes by, I won one of the tracks at HackMIT last year, and also at my uni. In fact, recently, I developed a contact tracing app for COVID-19 (BLE based) 2 months ago and is currently under talks of being licensed by some universities and few US states (would appreciate anonymity lol).

MIT was a dream since high school. Just re-watched my maker's video from HS. The only reason I can justify on why I couldn't get in could be my GPA.

393,Update on MIT Remote Graduate Research Assistantships: US immigration makes MIT force international students to stay in MA,1,2020-05-23 00:41:16,8,"My department was sent this email today, it appears to not have been sent to the entire MIT grad student community yet so I thought posting it here might be helpful.

Essentially this means that if you are an international student who is currently in the US, you have to stay in the US until you graduate (up to ""holidays"") or MIT won't pay you.

What I have been able to find out about this policy change so far:

\-This policy was quite likely forced on MIT by US immigration (vote!).

\-Students who want to return home in spite of this should be able to if they take a leave of absence for a semester, the issue is with paying students rather than the state of an F-1 or J-1 visa.

If anyone knows anything more on this, please leave a comment. If they can find anywhere on the MIT website where this change has been announced that would also be appreciated!

Have you ever gone through course selection and really wanted to know what the workload for a class was like, but didn't know anyone who took the class before and there are no reviews on VAgrades or RateMyProfessor? The only way you could learn about the class is to email the professor for a syllabus and hope they respond... yeah right good luck with that. But now no longer... with [SyllabiShare](https://syllabi-share.herokuapp.com/). (sorry for the infomercial monologue I always wanted to do one)

Over the past 4 days or so I have been developing an app that allows students to post syllabi for other people at their university to see and download. Now that I have secured a fair amount of AWS funding,   and a successful closed alpha/beta with students I know from universities across America, I will be holding an open beta for university students who see this post on Reddit/Facebook. The core functionality, uploading, searching for, viewing, and downloading syllabi, of the app is sound, but there are some UI things and extra features that need tweaking, which is what I need your help for. I ask that you login with your university email, upload a syllabus or two that are not already there, take a look at other syllabi, and leave some suggestions on the feedback tab on the site, in the comments of this post, or in a DM to me.

I also ask that you do not abuse this platform for anything it is not intended to do. I will be monitoring the site periodically to check for abusive content and take it down. I remind you that I will have computing ids and IPs of everyone posting.

Finally, if anyone would like to join a small team to help with this project please feel free to PM me. The code is public on Github for anyone to see and fork. This project is not for profit, any money that is made will be used to run this app, it ain't cheap and I am paying for AWS out of pocket once my free credit runs out. Please feel free take a swing at the app and try something new and let me know if there is something you want to see!

406,MIT thinking about next year,1,2020-05-25 00:57:47,32,"*This is the content of four pages that MIT posted last week to inform community discussion, for some reason access-restricted to those with current MIT certificates (so not alums, incoming first-years, parents, etc.).  What do we think?* 

**What We Know Now**

*During these uncertain times, some things are already clear and should be factored into the design and implementation of any option for the future. Below, we list some of them:* 

* MIT must meet all federal, state, and city requirements and adhere to public health orders. We will benchmark our planning and practices against the current guidance from other credible and relevant sources.
   * [Massachusetts COVID-19 Reopening Guidance](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/reopening-massachusetts)
   * [Public Health Principles for a Phased Reopening During COVID-19: “Guidance for Governors”; April 17, 2020](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/pubs_archive/pubs-pdfs/2020/200417-reopening-guidance-governors.pdf)
   * [American College Health Associationʼs Guidelines: Considerations for Reopening Institutions of Higher Education in the COVID-19 Era Guidance](https://www.acha.org/documents/resources/guidelines/ACHA_Considerations_for_Reopening_IHEs_in_the_COVID-19_Era_May2020.pdf) 
* The implementation of testing, tracing, and treatment protocols is essential to mitigating the risk of community spread of COVID-19.
* There will be ongoing physical distancing in classroom, research lab, residential, and work spaces. 
   * Roughly 100 fall subjects rely on access to the physical campus space to achieve the subject learning objectives. Roughly 3,000 students enroll in these subjects in a typical year. Physical distancing constraints in our instructional spaces will limit the in-person teaching that can be done on campus, and require that we teach and learn in different ways (e.g., fewer students at a time in teaching labs, design studios, project, and performance spaces and potential for broader use of the day for class hours).
   * Much of the curriculum (lectures, recitations, seminars) will be offered remotely in the fall and perhaps the spring as well, even when some or many students may reside on campus.
   * In the undergraduate residence halls, use of common spaces will be limited, food service options will include take-out services, and cook-for-yourself programming will likely be suspended during this period. P-setting and interactions with peers, house team members, and GRAs will be highly constrained under physical distancing. Recreational programming will be online or offered in de-densified settings. Access to common amenities such as gyms, lounges, and study rooms will be limited.
   * On-campus office spaces in which staff interact with faculty, students, and other staff (e.g., DSL headquarters, DAPER check-in, OVC headquarters, SFS, S\^3, OGE, MIT Medical, etc.) will need to be revamped to facilitate physical distancing. Examples include removing some furniture and chairs, putting up Plexiglass barriers and tape in lobby areas, and removing vending machines and reusable kitchen items. 
* Ongoing restricted access to MIT buildings will be necessary.
   * The campus will be allocated into sectors that will be entered by MIT ID-card based access. This will be less convenient and will require more planning to oneʼs day when coming to campus buildings to use on-campus resources. MIT is testing and adapting such approaches now with the existing on-campus population of residents, approved researchers, and campus support staff. 
* Not everyone will be able to or will choose to return to campus, even if permitted to do so. 
   * Some people fall into a high health risk category for COVID-19 or live with people who are high risk. Every member of the MIT community must do their part to protect these members of our community. Others may be impeded from being on campus due to travel restrictions and visa delays. Still other community members may have unique living situations where teaching, learning, and/or working are made more difficult by technology barriers, family responsibilities, and financial challenges. We must be agile and able to make arrangements for individuals who are remote.
   * The limited availability of MIT-owned residential beds in a de-densified campus setting poses a significant constraint. The Division of Student Life estimates the availability of 1,900 beds at one student per room and a 3:1 student/water closet ratio. Securing hotel beds may increase our capacity figures but doing so adds significant costs and presents potential negative implications for the student experience. 
* We will maintain our commitment to high-quality education, student support, and co-curricular and experiential learning opportunities in every option. We will revise academic policies and regulations to respond to the plan that is ultimately put in place.
   * Consistent with MITʼs mission, we will deliver “an education that combines rigorous academic study and the excitement of discovery”. We will ensure that students progress towards their degrees, minimize subject cancellations, and minimize pre-requisite disruptions. We have developed optimization methods to rapidly re-plan class schedules to achieve our objectives. 
* We will maintain our commitment to excellence in research and [graduate education](https://covid19.mit.edu/safe-gradual-return-to-campus-for-graduate-students). [The research ramp up process is designed to ensure this objective.](https://covid19.mit.edu/initial-process-for-on-campus-research-ramp-up)
* Creating a dedicated isolation space for students and other campus residents who test positive for COVID-19 is necessary in any of the scenarios being considered, as is a plan to scale back the reopening if community health and safety concerns necessitate a reduction in campus density levels again.

**What We Donʼt Know Yet**

*There are certain things we cannot know or guarantee at this moment, and there are certain questions we havenʼt answered yet. Any option for the fall and beyond will have several uncertainties in common, including:*

* The trajectory of the pandemic and the timeline for the development of a cost-effective, widely available vaccine and/or therapeutics.
   * We donʼt know what the public health situation will be within the city or state in the fall, including when or if a second wave will occur, when a vaccine or therapeutics will be available or once available, if we will be able to procure large enough quantities to immunize the entire community. Nevertheless, we must be prepared for dramatically changing health conditions in the next academic year (positive or negative). 
   * Based on what we know now, antibody testing is not likely to be helpful in the short to medium term for planning for return to campus but [may be helpful eventually](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/immunity-passports-in-the-context-of-covid-19).   
* Community membersʼ willingness to comply with physical distancing rules in classroom, research lab, residential, and work spaces. 
   * We donʼt know how well students and the rest of the MIT community will follow physical distancing policies; some current residents would like [stricter rules, and others would like more relaxed rules](https://www.dropbox.com/s/w6oqkxb6gipquxj/strengthen%20or%20relax%20housing%20policies.pdf?dl=0). 
* Who will be allowed to travel to campus, and the best decisions for which undergraduate students will return and when for options where only a fraction of the undergraduates are on campus at a given time.
   * For any case where only a fraction of the undergraduates are invited back to campus over a given period, we will have to make difficult choices about who to bring to campus and when, but we will seek to equally support and serve all of our students. We will also optimize our subject schedules to increase the ability of students to take the classes they need to progress academically. 
* Space availability to enable physical distancing on campus (in our academic spaces and undergraduate residence halls).
   * At current physical distancing guidelines, and taking into account the varied types of learning spaces and learning activities in MIT classes, we estimate that the academic campus can accommodate approximately 4,000 learners at a time. We could think of this as 4,000 students in classrooms/labs/studios/seminar rooms per day; or 8,000 if each student had a half-day on campus. Scheduling and judicious use of the hands-on-campus resource for in-person educational opportunities (e.g. lab, project and performance classes, design studios) for those who can be on campus will be important.  
   * Even as lectures, recitations, seminars, and large group gatherings are delivered remotely, individuals who choose to be on campus may benefit from physically-distanced, in-person interactions among others wearing face coverings, in medium-sized and large spaces (e.g., psetting, office hours, working on projects, practicing performances, etc.). Such spaces and the management of appropriate population density are under consideration now. 
   * We donʼt yet know how we will house and room residential students in a de-densified scenario and may need to explore the implications of securing hotel spaces and keeping some buildings (e.g., Burton Conner and Eastgate) in use to house graduate students, undergraduate students, and/or as isolation space. Nor do we know when the Site 4 and New Vassar residence halls will open following construction delays, but anticipate this will not be until January at the earliest (these buildings provide \~450 beds each of additional capacity).
* Short and long-term impacts on the wellbeing of community members.
   * While we will make every effort to create a positive and special living community on campus, some individuals may feel more isolated and have difficulties coping with the new normal. Others may have difficult living situations off-campus if they are remote.
* Short and long-term impacts on the residential education model and experience and co-curricular learning.
   * There are uncertain impacts on internships, and travel-related learning.
   * We donʼt know the extent of necessary changes to the academic calendar and curriculum. 
* Community responses and reactions to the options.
   * We donʼt know how many undergraduate and graduate students may wish to defer, take a leave of absence, or stay remote under the conditions in which MIT has to operate this fall. In a recent survey, [when asked about the housing options they were exploring for fall](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hnzthf4xbxc3xhz/housing%20options%20students%20are%20exploring.pdf?dl=0), about a quarter of continuing undergraduates checked “I would probably stay where I am now if MIT has online instruction and reduced campus operations (e.g., restricted access to campus; emergency housing policies).”    
 

**Steps MIT Can Take**

*Keeping in mind the* [*guiding principles*](https://covid-team2020.mit.edu/principles-values/) *and logistical, temporal, and financial realities, the following are examples of steps that MIT could decide to take that might impact the viability of the potential options.*

* Consider requiring [regular, community-wide testing, tracing, and treating](https://idss.mit.edu/research/idss-covid-19-collaboration-isolat/)
   * Consider requiring testing on arrival/re-entry to campus and periodically thereafter. MIT Medical would be able to collect specimens for up to 5,000 viral tests per week.
   * Consider requiring  use of a contact tracing app to facilitate testing, tracing, and treating [if we could ensure that it was accurate and could protect privacy](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01264-1).
   * Continue to provide quarantine spaces and care for students and other campus residents who have a positive COVID-19 test.
   * Continue to integrate the evolving information and protocols published in the literature into our processes for any testing, tracing, and treating as feasible and appropriate.
* Adopt new policies, procedures, and educational campaigns that promote recommended practices and support compliance with public health guidelines:
   * Enhance access to hand washing stations, hand sanitizer, face coverings and work activity-specific PPE; required access control for spaces, etc. consistent with our policies.
   * Enhance cleaning and stocking by staff who maintain facilities (e.g., more frequent cleaning and sanitizing schedule, restocking sanitizing wipe and hand sanitizer stations, etc.).
   * Establish and communicate work-at-home policies and expectations.
   * Establish and communicate expectations and protocols for being on campus (e.g., conduct meetings electronically, even when on campus; requirement to wear a face covering in any shared space; practice physical distancing; criteria to be eligible to return to campus; reminders through signage; training on new expectations; using health monitoring technology; etc.).
   * Redesign spaces to help maintain physical distance (e.g., remove furniture and chairs; Plexiglass barriers; removing vending machines and reusable kitchen items).
   * Establish remote, hybrid, and physically-distanced teaching, learning, and working options. 
* Teach, learn, and work in new modalities. 
   * The entire MIT community responded quickly and effectively on short notice to the pandemic in spring 2020. Going forward, we will have more time to carefully plan and prepare. We will continue to invest in existing and new academic and well-being support structures for our students; this includes, for example, our [student success coaches](http://news.mit.edu/2020/student-coaching-calls-pandemic-0501) and [other virtual support resources](https://covid19.mit.edu/virtual-student-support-resources).
   * We will redesign not only our formal curriculum but also co-curricular and experiential learning opportunities (e.g., UROP) so that we will continue to offer these exceptional parts of the MIT experience. For classes and experiences that typically require and rely on access to the physical campus space to achieve the subject learning objectives, we can explore and offer alternatives (e.g., mailing kits of parts home). 
* Implement a phased or staggered campus repopulation plan.
   * We can strictly limit visitors to campus. 
   * We plan to ramp up the research enterprise under the following parameters:
      * Reduced occupancy and density levels for our buildings and labs as prescribed by our medical and public health professionals. PI and DLC operating plans will align and be benchmarked against these levels. 
      * Only researchers and staff needing to use the physical campus will be allowed back during the ramp-up process. Clearly, this need is subjective and thus a period of comment and discussion with the faculty is underway to plan phases of research ramp up that would increase the number of MIT ID holders coming to campus to conduct research each day. Researchers and staff who can work remotely will continue to do so until conditions as determined by our medical and health professionals allow them to return to campus. 
      * Individual PIs and DLCs will be empowered to structure their research activities in response to these new occupancy and density levels. Priority should be given to activities that can easily be scaled up or scaled down if necessary.
      * Core facilities, shared resources, and other services will be made available to facilitate research activities broadly, provided they can function safely and within the predetermined limits regarding occupancy and density.
      * Access to buildings (and, where possible, individual spaces within buildings) will adhere to approved PI personnel plans; only those individuals who are approved to enter buildings will be allowed to do so and will do so through specific building access locations and protocols.
      * Anyone who chooses to participate in on-campus research can be supplied with face coverings or PPE if needed. Face coverings or masks will be required to be worn while working in MIT buildings. On-campus personnel will follow physical distancing protocols as described in PI space planning documents and DLC plans for common spaces. They can also submit to a daily health attestation as well as possible health monitoring and testing.
      * Researchers, students, and staff returning to campus to conduct or support research may be expected to enroll in an online environmental, health, and safety training course to learn about how to maintain a safe and clean work environment in the current COVID-19 era conditions. 
* Create and promote new modes of operating for student life and hands-on learning opportunities as well as community-building programs.
   * New virtual study lounges and other study spaces (remote and physically-distanced in person) could be used to promote academic belonging, peer-learning, and camaraderie. 
   * New campus organizations and events (e.g., discussion groups, representative bodies, etc.) can help anticipate and manage the range of issues that will arise in a physically distanced academic year. 
* Adapt MITʼs business operations to all options.
   * Essential campus services must be staffed according to acceptable campus density parameters and guidelines for safe working conditions and safe commuting. The research ramp-up plans, educational plans, and other MIT programs cannot create an unacceptable burden on these functions or these campus service staff.  
 

**Important Things to Consider for All Options**

*We realize that assessing the information on this site is, in MIT tradition, like drinking from a firehose. With that in mind, the list below succinctly presents the most crucial factors that informed our analysis of options and will need to be heeded in any adaptation to those options or in developing new ones.*

**Health Risk**

* Health risk to the MIT community 
* Health risk to the broader community beyond campus  
 

**Education and Student Experience**

* Quality of educational offerings  
* Quality of lab, project-based, performance classes, and other academic experiential learning (e.g., UROP)
* Student academic progression (e.g., numbers of potential schedule dislocations)
* Extracurricular and residential education (e.g., clubs, organizations, athletics, FSILGs, etc.)
* Impacts on student life goals (e.g., desire to be with friends, experience the campus, distributional impacts)
* Equity impacts on students, staff, and faculty
* Impact on residential operations 
* Impact on FSILGs (fewer students will live in FSILG housing, and FSILG leaders and alumni are working with MIT to consider how housing in FSILGs will work in the various options being considered for the upcoming academic year)  
 

**Implementation**

* Ease of public health protocol implementation
* Ease of curricular implementation
* Ease of implementation behaviorally
* Preparedness for a ramp-up (e.g., in the event of a vaccine)
* Preparedness for rapid wind-down (e.g., in the event of a second wave of cases)
* Confidence in planning estimates
* Impacts on faculty/staff (e.g. workload, different working hours)  
 

**Broader Institute Impacts**

* Financial sustainability 
* Reputational impacts 
* Longer-term impacts (e.g., deferrals)
* Cambridge/Boston community economic impact",0.07747268604411466,0.40368999428151214,ucla

As an minority, it's been hard to reconcile the fact that some of the most compassionate people I know, people who have been part of organizations like FUP, FLP, Camp Kesem are work at these companies and I don't know how to broach the subject with them without feeling like I'm attacking them. 

I understand that company policies do not equate to employee values and that jobs are not something you can just drop and pick up, but when minorities of all color (not just Blacks and Hispanics, but also Asians) are facing physical violence and dealth, should we as MIT alums with degrees that allow us to get jobs use our privilege to make sure we're not doing more harm than good?

Minoring in both economics and philosophy sadly doesn't work, and I don't have enough space to both major in philosophy and concentrate in economics (or double major in economics).

On the one hand, I think economics could be more practical. I eventually want to have a career in the tech industry that is more people and business-orientated, and I think economics could help with the initial understanding of fundamental concepts in business.

On the other hand, 14.01 was very mathematical, and I presume much of the other classes in economics are similarly so. I could see a lot of value in having a HASS double major that trains me in a different way of thinking, in oral/written communication, and in reflecting more deeply about the implications of the products and services that I create.

Hi there! I have some questions for the students/professors about your school!
I just graduated like a day ago with an associates degree in general studies at a community college at the age of 17, I'm so proud! Since I was very little it's always been my dream to get a much higher degree at MIT. I've visited the campus a couple of times before and absolutely fell in love. I would love to continue my education at my dream school, but these last 4 years have been nothing but hell for me no thanks to the HS and CC I graduated from. Within the year I've been diagnosed with PTSD officially ((but just between me, my doctor, and my therapist it's cPTSD)). I'm giving all this info because I want to know what professors and students think of the education your getting at MIT and if it's worth the stress? I've decided to postpone going to college for a year to figure out what I want to pursue, if I want to continue college at all. I'm writing this but keep finding I have more and more questions... Instead of writing a huge paragraph I'll bullet point my questions lol.
•Graduates, do you feel accomplished?
•Professors, do you like your co-workers? Why or why not?
•Staff, are you 100% confident in your mental health resources for students?
•From the full uncut tuition, what percent of that do you think is money well spent?
•Would you recommend this school to people with mental disabilities?
•If a student wanted to continue college solely for the community/opportunities/learning output, would you recommend MIT?

If you could think up any other info you think would be helpful I'd appreciate it greatly if you included it in your post! I used to be one of the ""Gifted"" and ""Talented"" kids but because of the treatment my schools have given me, I've become very disdain for corporate schooling.

------------------------------------------------------------------
### My experience with the FEE: Utter Failure.

I've spoken English my whole life. In the summer of 2008, I had to do the Freshman Essay Evaluation.

The topics were enjoyable to read and think about: The security of electronic voting machines and the ethics of paying human research subjects.

I could not do the writing. No words onto paper. No words onto keyboard. I..... just. could. not. write.
This had happened to me before. I sat for hours in my room, trying to get words to come out. None.
Usually, after enough time digging my nails into my skin, mentally shouting at myself to just buckle down and get it done, and eventually some tears.... something would unblock and I'd be able to write a first draft. Never any time to edit it, but oh well.

I turned in nothing.

I figured that I'd learn to overcome this by taking the technical writing class at MIT. Fun fact: no. The professor who teaches that class is _not_ a psychotherapist. Neither are the staff of the MIT writing center.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Correct, non-actionable advice: Just get words onto paper.

Good writing comes from editing. You need to have some words and paragraphs to mould and push into a good structure.

People will often phrase this as ""Don't care what someone would think; Just write a [crappy first draft](https://wrd.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/1-Shitty%20First%20Drafts.pdf) to get your thoughts on paper"". Fun fact: no. If you only imagine yourself doing a crappy job, you will not be very motivated to do it.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### How to actually execute that: Have a conversation.

Brains do things that they find rewarding.

If you have writers' block, you might notice that you're perfectly fine talking with them about the topic. That is because you can see the social reward in real time. You're turning vague notions into organized thoughts for the benefit of another person and (if they are paying attention to you), you can see their understanding. You might be fine texting someone or getting on reddit and commenting on a thread. Same thing: You imagine them listening to what you say and reacting.

Notice that commenting on reddit is a form of writing. Notice you're not writing crap, even if you're shitposting. You're having a conversation.

If you do this over IM with someone who is interested in the topic or prompt, you can then copy-paste your words and have the clay to mold into an essay.

If you do this over audio and record it (especially with an auto-transcription app like [otter](https://otter.ai/)), you can kinda do the same.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### What to do if you can't talk to someone -- Reward Loops 

I am a software engineer and we have technique for writing code even when we're worried that it will be crap or we don't know how it should be structured.

##### Test Driven Development

The technique is to repeat some small simple steps:

1. Write a program that does literally nothing.

2. Write a tiny program to check if the first program does a tiny bit.

3. The second program is a ""test"". Run it so you know that it says ""nope"".

4. Change the first program to do a tiny bit.

5. Run the test to see that it says ""yep"". Feel successful. 😃

6. Write a third tiny program to check if the first program does a tiny bit more.

7. Run this new test to see that it says ""nope.""

8. Add a tiny bit more to your first program...

Continue like this, writing tests and first running them so you know that they actually say ""nope"" when a feature is missing or buggy. You end up with the program you want and a bunch of tiny programs that automatically check that it works.

Notice that this technique keeps putting a small step of a goal right in front of you, letting you try things and observe the results, and showing you when you succeed at it.

[This is the same thing that video games do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGL5YGcAxEI&amp;t=22).

###### How to start a core reward loop for writing.

In order to feel rewarded for making progress, you need to imagine that you're succeeding at something. 

Succeeding at what? An essay asks you to answer a question. 

So type your own question and respond to it. Type the first response that comes to mind, even if that is another question. Just keep responding, writing questions guided by your curiosity or confusion and answers as you see them. 

Set a 10-minute [timer](https://www.online-stopwatch.com/) before you start this. 

At the end of the 10 minutes, notice if any questions seem relevant to the assignment. Copy those to a new page and start again. If your questions are along the lines of ""Why am I such a lazy piece of shit?"", then save that file somewhere else, open a new page, then get up and go for a walk or do some exercise. Come back to this with a fresh mindset.

Just keep typing questions and answers. You'll likely notice yourself wanting to give longer explanations to the questions and wanting to re-frame the questions. Once you've started doing that, you're plugged-in: you've begun to imagine a conversation partner and what they need to hear to satisfy their curiosity. Keep the conversation going and you'll soon have enough words of a first draft. Feel free to lengthen that timer from 10 minutes to 20 or 30 in the style of the [pomodoro technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0k0TQfZGSc). After several paragraphs, you might find yourself getting a bit confused and wanting to re-structure your sections so they make more sense to you. That is fine to do. You might want to make side-notes on a piece of physical paper or draw a diagram. Thats cool too. Just keep moving and keep a regular rhythm of checking in on yourself to see if you're still having a conversation that might be relevant. You are making clay. ITs fine that some of it won't be used.

### A note about the question ""Why"".

Yes, this does mean that you might start out asking ""why does anybody care?"" about the assignment. You might have previously asked a teacher and heard ""Just write the essay."" Your parent might have told you ""Because I said so"". You might have learned to stifle asking ""Why?"" in certain situations. 

You are now an adult. 

Your whole life is optional.^([1])

You have the freedom to pursue an answer to ""Why"". No particular person is obligated to answer you, but you can go ask someone else.

You can also just decide not to do something if you don't find a compelling reason for doing it.",0.0992121738215488,0.44236404509842003,ucla

476,Watched Epstein documentary on Netflix... shame on you MIT,1,2020-06-14 09:01:57,4,"Throwaway to avoid persecution, but I just watched the documentary of Jeffrey Epstein on Netflix... absolutely disgusting. Not only him but also all the collaborators. After doing some research about the consequences to the other players in this story, it came to my attention the role played by MIT. In particular the support to Jeffrey Epstein and the lack of regrets shown by the institution and its members.

It came ta my attention, in particular, the role of MIT Media Lab and Joi Ito, who was fired. But my surprise was the story of  Neri Oxman, whose work has been produced with money from a network of pedophilia, and she still teaching in MIT and representing the values of the institution!

For those who don't know the story, Jeffrey Epstein supported her work through donations, AFTER he was charged the first time for child trafficking, and he was a known child abuser. Apparently, his strategy was to donate to many people with good reputation but lacking ethical principles, to present himself as a philanthropist to the judge. When the money started flowing to the lab, one of his students told her that he felt uncomfortable using such money. She lied, telling him that she had ensured that no money from Epstein was being used. So, the students, who demonstrated more ethical values than her, continued working. Later it was discovered that she accepted the money with the condition that nobody knew, but not only she knew but also lied to her students to use them, and MIT resources, to produce presents for a pedophile, so money keeps flowing.

So, if you went to MIT, there are some chances you made presents for convicted (but wealthy) pedophiles.

MIT did nothing, tried to hide everything under the carpet, and had her superstar professor as an example of women in STEM. Remember, if you are a woman in STEM, MIT thinks the model you should follow is that everything is allowed, even if everything means supporting sexual abuse of girls.

I'm still confused about how MIT as an institution or its students and faculty bodies have decided to look away instead of on deeply clean your institution. But MIT is not the only one, surprisingly Netflix, who just made a 4 hours documentary to denounce Jeffery Epstein's case, did it a few months after releasing a chapter of Abstract highlighting the work of your beloved MIT professor. A work produced with money from a known pedophile by someone who knew the origin of the money! Cynicism over 9000!

The tolerance to child abuse by MIT is disgusting and disappointing. So, next time that you walk in the Media Lab and see the last artistic installation of one of your professors at the Media Lab lobby think about this: that has been built with money from child abuse.

Of course, this will mean that I'm already behind the bulk of MIT applicants who likely took calc BC as a senior.

My school does things weird. Before going into BC, they require you to take AB. I took Pre Calc H as a Junior and want to do calc AB over the Summer to take BC as a Senior. I did the math and found out that this approach will mean I'll have to work at least 5 hours a day for the entire Summer to do the course.

Both of my papers are about topics that are very near and dear to my heart and will also be on the topic that I'm hoping to pursue as an undergrad.

I was also planning on working with someone to get a paper published. I might be able to get one paper complete, however I have a very interesting topic for the second. Thus, taking AB over the Summer will cost me the second paper.

As a quick side note, there is a small chance I might actually be able to get a paper published with one of the professors at a lab at MIT I've talked with before.

I want to go into nuclear or mech sci at MIT. Would you recommend that I go with publishing the second paper (the first one I'll definitely be able to do in either case) or taking calc AB over the Summer so I can do BC as a Senior?

im a rising senior (c/o 2021). i am very strongly against enrolling next semester (and probably the whole year). it just wont be the same in so many ways even if i do live in the dorms (which sounds pretty miserable given the restrictions). id rather take a gap year and come back when things are mostly normal, even if that means i cant live in on-campus dorms for my senior year when i return (since i wont be guaranteed housing anymore...)

what are ideas people have for spending time at least partially productively during a 2020-21 gap year? 

im applying to internships but theres not many posted and i only have research experience (no industry internships). anyone know of study abroad programs, or online courses (maybe programming bootcamp type things?) that are either reasonably cheap or have financial aid? have any unique or out-of-the-box ideas for a gap year in the COVID-era?",0.05894781144781146,0.5293518518518519,ucla
521,We need to do something about Comcast,1,2020-06-23 23:14:22,3,"My internet cuts out dozens of times per day, making it very difficult to work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. **And it seems like I'm not the only one.** Cambridge has given a monopoly to Comcast, making it the only real ISP in town. I have personally contacted Comcast over 20 times about this issue and they refuse to fix it.

**I think we should do something about this.** Even if you are not having internet issues, you are probably suffering from the Comcast monopoly in Cambridge. We need more internet options in our city, but the Cambridge City Manager and the Cambridge City Council refuse to address this problem.

If this is something you care about, here are some things you can do:

1. Read and sign this petition for municipal broadband: [https://upgradecambridge.org/](https://upgradecambridge.org/)
2. Contact the Cambridge City Council and let them know you will be voting on this issue ([council@cambridgema.gov](mailto:council@cambridgema.gov))
3. Spread the word (Twitter, Slack, email lists). If someone could post this on large university email lists (such as the CSAIL list), I know there would be a lot of interest.
4. Vote. The government won't do anything unless we make it a priority for them. The City Manager, Louis DePasquale, has actually blocked this issue from moving forward. He needs to listen to Cambridge residents or be replaced with someone who cares.
5. Ask for alternatives: [netblazr.com/](https://www.netblazr.com/), [verizon.com/home/fios-fastest-internet/](https://www.verizon.com/home/fios-fastest-internet/) (\*some people do not like Verizon; see link below), [rcn.com/boston/](https://www.rcn.com/boston/), [starry.com](https://starry.com/)

Nothing is going to change unless we do something about it. **These steps only take a few minutes and could greatly improve our city.**

546,Williams College decreases tuition by 15% for 2020-21 academic year,1,2020-06-30 02:31:40,11,"What do people think about pressuring for this at MIT? Reading the survey results from MIT's survey of students on the remote-learning experience, I am not at all confident that I will be getting my money's worth. I don't expect MIT to successfully adopt to full on-campus learning, but I do expect them to make some changes due to the clearly inadequate experience that online learning gives. In addition to that, many people have experienced decrease in wages or loss of work due to the pandemic, including myself.

 [Williams College](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/780717Z:US), the richest liberal arts school in the U.S., is reducing its cost by 15% for families on a one-time basis for the coming academic year and canceling sports competition and travel for the season as the coronavirus upends higher education.

The changes come “in recognition of the extraordinary circumstances and of this academic year and the uncertainty we face in the year ahead,” the Williamstown, Massachusetts, school said in a [statement](https://president.williams.edu/writings-and-remarks/letters-from-the-president/announcing-our-plan-for-fall-2020/) Monday. 

“This reduction recognizes the fact that the pandemic and associated challenges are requiring us to cancel winter study as well as fall athletics competition and many student activities, among other opportunities that we usually encourage families to expect as part of their student’s education,” school President Maud Mandel said.

Schools across the U.S. are coping with uncertainty for the year that begins in August or September as it’s largely unclear whether in-person courses will be offered given the rise in Covid-19 cases. Students at dozens of schools have already balked at the full price for last semester’s tuition with months of online classes, suing for billions of dollars in refunds.

“In higher education, we’re trained to believe that expensive is good,” said [Robert Kelchen](https://www.shu.edu/profiles/robertkelchen.cfm), an associate professor of higher education at Seton Hall University. “Now, in this economic crisis, families are more price-sensitive than they have been.”

The move by Williams, which has about 2,100 students, may put pressure on other selective liberal arts schools to follow.

“For this year, it may be less expensive for the colleges to do because a lot of students who pay full price are international students, and they may not be counting on them,” Kelchen said.",0.14615975422427036,0.46221198156682025,ucla

International students are too big of a cash cow for universities to let go.

=======

Regardless of whether the deportation order is legal it is indisputably an incredibly dumb policy move. These are exactly the people there is near universal agreement we want to attract to and incentivize to stay in the country. They are the least likely to become wards of the state and most likely to fill needed gaps in the highly skilled sectors of the job market.


======

This is so frustrating to see. As a student I’ve switched from online to seated over the semesters. So these students would be deported for a semester then next semester when they take one seated they’d be allowed to come back, but then the following semester if they take all online they’d be deported again? Sounds like a huge waste of time and people’s money traveling that much. Especially since we are in new territory and who knows how long universities will be doing mostly online, this may go on for a couple semesters.


=====

Are international students who take online only courses normally granted F1 visas?  No, but international students who take courses at Harvard and MIT are, and Harvard and MIT don't normally go 100% online.

And as the complaint lays out, ICE actually provided exceptions to that policy for the second half of the spring 2020 semester, by explaining that its typical rules should not apply throughout the ""duration of the emergency.""

596,What to do during a gap year?,1,2020-07-11 00:48:15,6,"I’m a prefrosh that’s strongly considering a gap year. My main reasons for considering one are that classes just don’t seem to be worth the same tuition, and an online freshman year experience seems far from optimal (especially at MIT, where I’m told that the freshman experience is a very special one). I’m also worried about transitioning to MIT without the support of a solid friend group.       
        
However, the main thing that’s stopping me from requesting one right now is that I don’t know what I would do during a gap year. A lot of the usual gap year activities (e.g. internships, travel, getting a job) seem difficult to do during a pandemic. I know there’s the option of studying through OCW and then taking more ASEs after the gap year, but my brain is telling me I need to do something more productive than that.      
     
I would appreciate it if a current student or alum could give suggestions on what to do during a gap year or offer their thoughts on taking a gap year in general. And if there are any other prefrosh considering taking one, what are you planning to do during it?

Curious if anyone here or anyone’s friends have been trying to set up a Social Impact Work-Study with PKG this summer.

624,E15,1,2020-07-17 03:00:32,6,"A friend and MIT grad wrote to me yesterday, “I don’t know if the Media Lab is redeemable at all.” This in the wake of the bombshell Ronan Farrow piece in the New Yorker, reporting that the Media Lab under its director Joi Ito had covered up a much closer relationship with Jeffrey Epstein than previously revealed. Ito promptly resigned.

The Media Lab has always occupied a curious place in the tech world. According to itself, it “transcends known boundaries and disciplines by actively promoting a unique, antidisciplinary culture that emboldens unconventional mixing and matching of seemingly disparate research areas … In its earliest years, some saw the Media Lab as a house of misfits. Here, the emphasis was on building; the Lab’s motto was “demo or die.””

It ceased being viewed as a house of misfits a long time ago. Instead it has become perceived as a hyper-prestigious, creme-de-la-creme entity, a weird mixture of counterculture and patrician, seen as home to the best (and coolest) of the best, whose annual budget has tripled from $25 million in 2009 to $75 million in 2019. It seems fair to estimate that roughly a billion inflation-adjusted dollars have been spent on it since its birth in 1986.

While it’s an academic institution it has always been exceptionally business-oriented. “At first glance, much of the Media Lab’s research may seem tangential to current business realities, but for more than 30 years, the Lab has demonstrated that seemingly “far out” research can find its way into the most conventional—and useful—applications … The Media Lab has spawned dozens of new products by our members, and over 150 start-up companies,” to quote, again, them.

And yet. One can’t help but notice. Consider its basic ingredients:

+    founded in 1986, as Moore’s Law began to hit us all, and tech began the exponential growth that has made it the world’s dominant force
+    at the most prestigious technical university on the entire planet
+    in a position to pick and choose from the brightest minds of its generation
+    allotted $1 billion to spend over those thirty years of hockey-stick growth

Given all that, wouldn’t you have expected … well … a whole lot more than what it has actually accomplished?

=== ==== =====

Given all that, wouldn’t you have expected … well … a whole lot more than what it has actually accomplished?

Because that list of accomplishments is surprisingly scrawny. Take its spin-off companies. Here’s its list. Trivia question: how many Media Lab spinoffs have gone public, without merging or being acquired, in its 33 years of existence? As far as I can tell, the answer is one, and even that comes with a sizable asterisk: the Art Technology Group, which didn’t start building products until six years after it spun out (it was a consultancy), IPOd during the first dot-boom, and was eventually acquired by Oracle.

There are companies you’ll recognize on that list. Well, there’s one: BuzzFeed. Yes, really. There are a few others of note. Harmonix, makers of Rock Band. Makani Power, acquired by Alphabet six years ago. Elance, which became Upwork and then had its platform phased out. Jana. Formlabs, Otherlab, The Echo Nest, all of which I think are great, but none of which I would have heard of if not for some personal connections. One Laptop Per Child, a bad idea a decade ago and a forgotten one now. And, notably, E Ink, the Media Lab’s one definite, unambiguous big win … back in 1996.

It’s not nothing, but it’s so much less than you’d expect, given its ingredients. It’s certainly no Bell Labs, or Xerox PARC, or even Y Combinator, and I say that as someone who is less of a YC enthusiast than most of the Valley.

OK, I hear you arguing, but they’re a basic research facility! Spinoff companies are not their true measure of success! Sure. Fine. So let’s take a hard look at their own list of their top 30 tech products or platforms (PDF). Aside from E Ink — which, again, was 23 years ago — doesn’t that look a lot like a list of occasionally interesting, but fundamentally limited and/or niche, technologies? Doesn’t it seem rather utterly devoid of any significant impact on the world?

Wouldn’t you have expected so, so much more?

Criticisms that the Lab is more about style and sizzle than serious substance are not exactly new. Nor are they old: here’s a piece condemning its recent “personal food computer” as smoke and mirrors that doesn’t actually work. This “Hunter S. Negroponte” piece dates back to the 1990s. It’s satire, but if you read it, you’ll likely find you can’t help but raise your eyebrows and wonder just how far back the Media Lab’s systemic problems go.

Maybe if it hadn’t been a “plutocratic friendocracy,” to quote former Media Lab faculty, and it had actually systemically favored the best and brightest and most innovative, regardless of background or personal connection — maybe then things would have been very different. Maybe it would actually have been what it pretended to be for all this time.",0.19177243211334127,0.44380845795618523,ucla

Everyone around me also called it ""the money major"" which made sense at the time. But now, after thinking more about the curriculum requirements, it doesn't actually seem like a very employable major compared to others? My interests have shifted more towards software engineering, data science, and quant finance/trading. 6-14 seems to be intended as the data science major for MIT, but don't DS jobs usually require grad school not just a B.S. in DS? The CS requirements also seem a little inadequate for SWE. For quant, it looks like 6-14 is just an easier/less mathematical version of 18C, which would probably be more ideal for those jobs.

I could definitely pass 6.0001 with a little studying, but I feel like even then, I won't be 100% grasping everything that's taught in the course.

I'm not sure if the ASEs are right for me, and I hope to get some advice from the MIT community. I'm thinking of premed, so GPA matters quite a bit. 

From my perspective:

Pros of not taking ASEs:

* Easier classes (I could frontload on my major classes and retake my GIRs sophomore/junior year when I'm taking tougher classes)
* Better GPA (I basically know &gt;70% of the material for 8.01, 18.01, 6.0001, and 7.03)
* Solid Foundation (I would not say I've reached complete mastery of 8.01, 18.01, 6.0001, 7.03 material)

Cons:

* I could take more challenging/cooler classes and get GIRs out of the way

I've noticed that problem sets from my classes took some problems from older MIT handouts via OCW, so I'm suspecting that both schools follow a similar pattern.",0.14270833333333335,0.6385416666666667,ucla

752,Is Double Majoring Feasible without ASEs?,1,2020-08-13 20:56:27,5,"Hello, 

I'm an incoming freshman, and I want to double major in math and physics. I successfully got credit for 18.01 and 18.02 and plan on trying to take the 18.03 ASE, but I'm mostly concerned about physics. In hindsight, I know I made some mistakes on the 8.01 ASE (silly things like forgetting a minus sign, but I'm not sure if I will be heavily docked for this), and, while I did self-study a lot of E&amp;M and Quantum Mechanics, I figured I should probably take the courses since I likely didn't have the same rigor as the MIT courses, especially since my only high school physics course was non-AP (my school didnt offer it) and wasn't particularly rigorous.

So, my question is this: is it still feasible for me to pursue a double major even if I have to start from 8.01? Would I be able to finish in 4 years? Are passing the ASEs important as far as completing the graduation requirements for a major, or do they just free up space for other classes that are taken out of interest rather than necessity?

I already have a master's, so I really need to make sure I'm paired with a lab I'd be happy committing my PhD to right off the bat.

My thought is that if I defer, I'll give myself more time to find an advisor and I'll hopefully be entering MIT when more labs are hiring.

I’m extremely interested in transferring into MIT, but I noticed a stipulation on the requirements, that students with over 2.5 years completed will not be considered. 

I have completed 4 full (15 credits avg) semesters, along with a singular summer semester that gives me a total of 61 credits. This is technically 5 Semesters, but not 2.5 years. 

Additionally, if I take another ~12 credits in the fall at my current college, that will bring me to 2.5 years total. Is that restriction exclusive (as in, those with 2.5 years are fine, but above is rejected)? 

I’ve asked my advisor about this, but they haven’t gotten back to me. I don’t think they know the answer to it regardless.

On one hand, it makes sense for me to finish the 5.111 GIR now, which would leave me with only the 8.02 GIR in the spring. (I ASE'd out of 18.02, 8.01, and 7.012.) Also, I'm about 60% sure that I'll end up as a 6-3 major, which doesn't require 18.03. 

On the other hand, there's that other solid \~40% chance that I'll become a 6-2 or 18-C, both of which require 18.03. Since I like math and I'm not taking 18.02 this semester, taking 18.03 will be pretty fun. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, what do you think---5.111 or 18.03? Is it a good idea to take 18.03, now or in the spring, when I will likely end up in a major that doesn't require it?

I've heard both sides: for 6.042, it helps to build proof-writing skills and solidify concepts that are seen in 6.006, plus it covers REST; for 6.006, it's nice to take 6.006 ASAP and 6.042 isn't terribly useful.

I'm a rising high school senior who's trying to figure out where to go to college. I posted a really long post in the applyingtocollege sub and got suggestions to post on specific school subs. A few things to know first,

 **Me**

* 3.86 unweighted gpa, SAT 1350, 100%%%%% retaking that thing in September, ew, have talked with the schools about just not sending my score in because it'll just hurt my application.
* AP Classes I have taken, Bio, BC Calc, Chinese, English (got credit for it, the school didn't actually have an AP English class. AP Classes I will take, Stats, Comp Science Principles, Environmental Science or Physics. AP Test scores are not up for discussion ( I did pass the tests I took). I've taken almost all of the AP classes offered at my school with the exceptions of AP world history and either AP Physics or ES depending
* Extracurriculars: my sport, last summer volunteering with a local team (only a couple times due to schedule conflicts). Looking to try and set up a virtual internship or doing a senior year project with Uncommon autumn
* Individual hobbies: Drawing, writing, reading, taught myself how to use After Effects to a certain degree (thanks anime), been doing some 3D exploration with cinema 4d (the most basic low poly stuff)
* I'm an athlete talking to coaches, MIT recruiting works pretty differently than other colleges as it doesn't have recruiting spots (that's what I was told)
* I'm looking at mainly MIT and NYU, Sloan and Stern. Business. I don't want to go into IB, leaning towards something that has business, some CS, and the ability to go international. 
* NYU has asked me to commit and to let them know by next Tues
* I have a virtual visit with MIT at the end of September

**Pros and Cons of choosing MIT**

**MIT**

Pros: Reputation, education, focus more on STEM, seems more global, potential career, internships. Facilities are amazing. I like Boston, not super far from home. More of a traditional college experience compared to NYU.

Cons: Was told that I'm a ""competitive recruit"" and have a 50/50 chance of getting in, so it's a pretty big risk (I personally think the percentage is lower because I have about 0 extracurriculars which was a byproduct of mental health fluctuations). Less specific options to major in. Focus on STEM. Will have to wait until the end of September to see if I'm a fit with the team. ED is *not binding*. &gt;1% chance of getting in without sport. 

**Basically**

I have a chance to go to Stern with a good chance of getting in and a 50/50 chance to get into MIT but if I don't get in, I'll have missed two very good opportunities. If the coach I'm talking to sees this, I just want to say I'm quite stressed and I would love to go to either school, I'm just stuck between two choices that are both very good for what I'm looking for and trying to figure out the risk-reward ratio. 

**What I wanted to ask in a nutshell**

MIT Sloan vs NYU Stern if I don't decide to go into finance? MIT major flexibility? What's MIT like? How heavy is STEM focus in Sloan? Is it worth the risk of going for MIT given my current academic situation? Networking? Future opportunities? Most common jobs/career paths? Internships? Studying abroad?

I'm personally leaning more towards music because I haven't really done anything outside of playing instruments, and MIT's music tech classes are sick. Also most of the classes I wanna take involve some sort of programming/software development aspect, so I think it would help me in that regard too (not super proficient at coding just yet).

But I do see the benefits of an econ concentration too. In general, it's nice to be financially literate and educated, but this could also open up a career in trading/stocks/data science in the business world. (Also parents see music as useless and econ as the gold standard of HASS).

I'm interested if anyone has recently gone through MIT's hiring process for facilities/administration type positions and knows if they drug test. I currently use recreational marijuana (legal in MA) and have for some time. Normally, this wouldn't be an issue as I stop using prior to searching for a job in case a drug test is required, but in this case, I had been in the application process for this position prior to Covid and then was told there was a hiring freeze for the foreseeable future (approximately 3 months ago). 

Today I received an email that they would be moving forward with hirings again and were looking to move forward on my application process. I obviously stopped consuming any marijuana products as soon as I got the email, and I'm working towards being able to pass the exam, but I'd like to know if anyone has any recent experience in the hiring process for MIT to see when in the timeline they were drug tested so I have some idea how long I have to prepare?",0.09642857142857142,0.36428571428571427,ucla
890,A different kind of welcome: Fall 2020 Covid policies,1,2020-09-08 22:18:02,7,"To: Off-Campus Graduate Students
From: Suzy M. Nelson, Vice President and Dean for Student Life
Sent: Monday, September 7, 2020 12:00
Subject: A different kind of welcome: Fall 2020 Covid policies
 
YOU NEED TO KNOW: off-campus event prohibition; expedited disciplinary process for Covid policy violations; success depends on all of us!

Dear graduate students living off campus,

This is an unusual fall semester as MIT manages a pandemic, and the United States and countries around the world deal with the mounting toll of Covid cases.  Against this backdrop, there is continued unrest in cities across the country in the wake of police violence, systemic inequity, and the deaths of too many Black Americans. Further exacerbating these situations are natural disasters in the country's southern and western regions and a contentious national election.

To all of you anxious about any of these issues, know that MIT is here for you. Please reach out if you need to talk with someone.

MIT's plan for moving forward during the pandemic is guided by science and common sense. As I detail in a message I sent to graduate students living on campus, life at MIT is different now. But, if we work together and adhere to and have patience with Covid policies--both from MIT and in the communities where you live and work now--we can meet the challenges ahead.

Events, parties, and gatherings off campus. Don't organize or attend off-campus events, parties, or gatherings until further notice--they are a leading cause of Covid hotspots on college campuses. MIT will take swift disciplinary action in response to violations of MIT Covid policies through an expedited Committee on Discipline process. Students who attend or host off-campus parties, events, or gatherings may face disciplinary action including potential suspension or loss of future campus access.

Campus Access. Students living off-campus who have not been granted official access to MIT facilities through Covid Pass for academic and research purposes may not be on campus or in campus buildings at any time. Students who do have official access through Covid Pass may use academic and research facilities they are cleared to enter, DAPER indoor and outdoor facilities (with a valid membership), and designated outdoor common areas in groups no larger than the posted occupancy. Only current MIT Housing residents may enter the Student Center and use its foodservice facilities. This chart may help clarify who has access to campus facilities. 

Additional Policies and Updates

As you can see, we take student health, wellness, and safety seriously. Please review The Mind and Hand Book, which contains essential information on standards of behavior and student life policies. Other important policies include:

  - MIT's community standards such as the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act statement;
  - Discrimination, harassment, and Title IX resources that help make our campus safe; and
  - MIT's policy against hazing to support a safe and welcoming environment for all.

The success of the semester depends on every one of us! 

The Institute's decision to stick with our reopening plan is grounded in our confidence that every MIT community member will rise to the challenge.

Our plan for the fall and beyond is being put to the test. Working together, we can pass it with flying colors.

Best,
Suzy",0.10661343161343163,0.4495495495495496,ucla

895,Curious to know why IDSS won't accept the TOEFL test as a proof of fluency in English.,1,2020-09-09 17:25:52,0,"MIT Graduate School states that every department decides on what tests will be accepted as proof of fluency in English.

As someone whose first language isn't English, I need to take such tests and until today, every Engineering department I've checked will accept both the IELTS or the TOEFL. I think it's because it gives students the chance to apply no matter what test they took.

I just checked MIT IDSS's website and they don't accept the TOELF test. 

Both tests are pretty expensive, especially when your currency fluctuate a lot against the dollar, and it seems counterintuitive to accept only one test since people who have taken the TOEFL would have to pay to take yet another test. Given the price tag of these tests, the costs involved might be prohibitive.

I thought that IDSS might have some issue with ETS, the TOEFL provider, but I saw they take the GRE, which is also provided by ETS. Also, the TOEFL is accepted worldwide by many elite institutions. Many of MIT Departments, in fact, accept the TOEFL.

If you know the reason, I'm curious to know what it is. =)",0.11666666666666665,0.6277777777777778,ucla

921,Wear your Mask or else!!,1,2020-09-16 13:18:04,0,"Dear Assistant Dean, AO, or HR Partner,

As part of its pandemic policies, MIT issued a Return to Work on Campus policy, detailing the safety requirements for being on campus, such as completing the daily health attestation and the wearing of face coverings.

To aid in making quick and consistent responses to alleged violations of the Return to Work on Campus policy, MIT will follow a new process, summarized below. This new process (Touchstone login required) applies to allegations against faculty and staff; a similar expedited Committee on Discipline process is in place for allegations against students.

The key provisions are:

Expedited review process

All complaints of alleged violations of the Return to Work on Campus policy are forwarded to the Manager of Institutional Compliance at covidcompliance@mit.edu.
The Manager of Institutional Compliance, in consultation with the OGC and others, will work with the DLC to find facts and appropriately respond.
The alleged violator will be informed and given an opportunity to respond.
Decision making

Low-level violations: DLC will determine appropriate response and/or sanction.
Other violations:
By faculty, other academic, postdoctoral, or research staff: Provost or VP for Research, in consultation with the school dean, will determine response/sanctioning.
By other staff: VP for HR will determine response/sanctioning.
Guidelines for Response/Sanctions

The decision maker – the DLC, Provost, VP for Research, or VP for Human Resources – will refer to the following guidelines when determining the response/sanctions. That said, each case is unique, and these guidelines are not prescriptive; they are intended to offer a basis from which to make a decision about a case. The decision-maker should consider the totality of the circumstances, including aggravating and mitigating factors, when determining sanctions.

 

Type of Violation

Potential Outcome

First-time face covering

Written reminder of policy, and warning that additional violation of this requirement could result in discipline.

 

First time “low level”

Disciplinary written warning.

Second time “low level”

OR

First time “medium level”

One-day disciplinary suspension without pay or access.

Repetition of above categories and
“high level” violations
Five-day disciplinary suspension without pay, or termination of employment. If individual is a tenured faculty member, referral to Provost for appropriate sanction.

 

KEY:

Types of “low-level” violations: one-time face covering or social distancing violation.
Types of “medium-level” violations: one-time access to building without approved access, failure to test, or second incident of a failure to wear a face covering.
Types of “high-level” violations: violating quarantine, repeated violations of the above categories.

955,Flu shot - no exceptions for vegans,1,2020-09-25 20:20:11,7,"As you may know, the flu shot is made with chicken's eggs. As I understand it, a virus is introduced to the egg, and the virus does its virus thing, and infects the egg cell and uses it to replicate virus copies. These are then harvested and used in the vaccine.

For this reason, when you get a flu shot, you mark a form that says whether you have an egg allergy (there's a chance some egg got into your vaccine).

Because eggs are used, flu shots are technically not vegan-friendly. MIT is requiring all students to get flu shots, and they have explicitly said the only exceptions that will be granted are medical or religious exemptions.

If they're allowing religious exemptions then I don't see why being a strict vegan would not be similar - it's a deeply held personal belief which is somewhat different from the belief the majority holds, but it drives your life choices and is a core part of who you are, and going against those beliefs is something you feel is very wrong. If it was ""Medical exemptions only"", I would say ""okay fair enough"", but adding in religious without adding in vegan too seems odd.

The question for the essay is: ""Please describe your reason for pursuing the Master of Business Analytics degree. What do you hope to gain from the program? And what are your career aspirations? (500 words or less)""

At the moment, I wrote 4 paragraphs. The first one is introducing that Asian market is growing and digitalizing (which make an Asian person like me more likely to be accepted) with some statistics numbers.

The second one is detailing my first job in one start-up company, which equipped me with skills like Python, SQL, SAS...etc. 

The third paragraph is about my second job in one big financial company focusing on trading but less data analysis. 

And the last one is my conclusion about why MIT is my best choice currently. My argument includes my skill-sets, contribution to the program (like domain knowledge about financial market), and the academic reputation of MIT (ex: alumni resources).

1014,Double Major in Aero/Astro and Physics with a minor in Material Science and Engineering?,1,2020-10-15 13:20:41,6,"Hi everyone,

So I’m a current freshman here at MIT and just wanted to ask a question. With me wanting to double major in Aerospace Engineering and Physics to try to get both a systems Engineering and technical science background in my undergrad (but also because I love all of it) and after seeing how other students do it successfully without dying, its something I’m pretty set on committing to here at MIT. 

However, I started looking into the Material Science Department here and after poking my head into some of the research labs (MIT Nano) and letting my love for chemistry come out, I’m now considering maybe minoring in Mat Sci along with my double major (because I love Aero/Astro and Physics a lot more).

The way I’m looking at it would be if it gets too stressful and it’s not fun anymore I’d drop it, but what do you guys think about actually trying to do that? I thought it would be awesome to not only get Engineering education, but also a good knowledge base in chemistry and physics as well! 

Would this be a great thing to enter industry with or do you guys think it wouldn’t be worth it? 

*Note: I am trying to have a social life and I don’t want to do this just to flex. I just saw it as a great way to combine all my interests into a great undergrad experience. Since my concentrations in Aero/Astro and Physics would be robotics and propulsion, a Mat Sci minor made sense :)

1017,What to do,1,2020-10-16 05:58:16,20,"Sorry to bring down the mood but I've been having the hardest time here. I'm failing more classes than passing and it's only halfway of the freshmen fall semester. I study pretty efficiently (I'm sure I can improve upon this but it has worked for the most part in the past) but I still get C/D/Fs on my tests. Recently one of my profs showed a test distribution and I  scored in the bottom 1%. 

It probably doesn't help that I grew up in the typical Chinese-American family, applied here for my parents, and admitted for my parents. I really wanted to study classics at Berkeley for law school (I live in NorCal), but even aside from my parents, people told me I was stupid to turn down MIT for a public state school. Every time I try to talk to my associate advisor it ends up in me bluffing and saying how excited I am for the potential that this school offers, but in reality, I can't find any reason to go on. I feel like I basically ruined my future. 

Has anyone else dealt with this? I know that online school probably changes the experience by a great margin, but I'm not sure if this will change regardless of campus. A lot of people tell me that ""you're not the only one"" and ""there are people doing worse than you,"" and I try to take this to heart, but it means very little when I'm actually doing worse than 99% of students in my class.

1019,BLACK FUTURE,1,2020-10-17 15:15:47,0,"The year is 2045. The southern United States lives under BLACK RULE. All white males are sissified. White women live to serve BLACK KINGS in vast reproduction facilities. Welcome to America's BLACK FUTURE.

&amp;#x200B;

Alex Lang remembers life before the revolution – before the government-issued hormones, the sissy wigs, frilly lingerie, and mandatory chastity. He lives on the war-torn outskirts of New Africa, where he hides his beautiful blonde step-sister Kaylee from the clutches of the brutal New African army.

&amp;#x200B;

As musclebound black soldiers prowl the countryside searching for fertile white women, Alex will stop at nothing to protect sweet Kaylee's purity. In his pink-and-blue wig, flirty sissy skirt, and fishnet stockings, Alex gives his tender white body to a gang of pitiless black alpha soldiers: the ultimate act of courage and sacrifice. But is sissy Alex prepared for the overwhelming demonstration of power and domination? The encounter brings him face-to-face with his worst fears... and his most unspeakable sissy fantasies.

&amp;#x200B;

Acclaimed author and pro domme Whitney Ryan presents a tantalizingly political vision of the future. Her powerful, vivid, fly-on-the-wall passages of three-on-one interracial man-on-sissy action push the boundaries of sensual fiction. The BLACK KINGS have their way with Alex's sissy body, pumping and pounding and cursing through one of the hottest gang scenes in the history of the genre. And interspersed throughout the sizzling prose, a suspenseful narrative full of imaginative world-building unfolds.

&amp;#x200B;

Experience the true power of black bulls in black jackboots. Prepare to pay the ultimate reparations. Explore the mind-bending world of BLACK FUTURE, the first book in Whitney Ryan's brand new series.",0.05346320346320347,0.48504689754689745,ucla

INDRA, the Aryan God, was an arrogant wh\*Toid who was killing black people. Then, arose a BULL, by the name of KRISHNA, his name literally meaning ""BLACK"" to describe his BLACK BULL nature, he slayed the wh\*Te scum in battle and made the Aryan God, Indra to bow down to him and submit. He also married the whitest girl, Radha and made the glorious INDIC UBERMENSCH race.

&amp;#x200B;

We all know that the BLACK lands of India and Europe were invaded by Aryans, who raped the native populace and now their mutt children became the Indo-Aryans and Europeans.

&amp;#x200B;

However, in India the BLACK race resisted, and became the Afro-Dravidian übermensch.

&amp;#x200B;

Krishna, a BLACK man, slayed the Aryan warmongerer Indra and made him submit. This is why in India they still worship him as the supreme lord and they worship the BLACK penis (Shivalingam).

&amp;#x200B;

2000 years later, the wh\*Te gayreeks attacked the black nation of India. Wh\*te armies had conquered Persia, Israel, AFRIKA and many other bull nations, India was the last stand against the wh-te race. Then arose another BLACK BULL by the name of CHADragupta who defeated the wh\*Tes as a payback for invading black countries.

&amp;#x200B;

Another 1000 years later, the wh7te Huns invaded India again, rose another black BVLL by the name of SKANDAGUPTA who btfo'd whites again.

&amp;#x200B;

Sadly, the nefarious plans of the whites had succeeded in 1857 as it seemed the black nation of India had finally been defeated, but then it wasn't over because the black übermesnch in India refused to give up. Rose another BLACK BVLL by the name of Mohaneo Jamaland Gandhi. He triggered wh\*Tes with the power of his mere speech.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the black Indians are being imported en masse in San Francisco where they're surrounded by wh-Te Mexican immigrants. The Indians must now fight to end this accursed race for once and for all.",-0.0734674329501916,0.4407088122605365,ucla

Just imagine, it's a nice sunny Sunday afternoon, imagine the bustle of this 100% wh\*Te town until suddenly a couple of BLACK bulls walk up. Women would feel more attraction to these superior, strong bulls infinitely more than their pathetic wh\*Te husbands. Every woman would be begging, grovelling to be impregnated by these overlords, the new kings of the town who earned this position with nothing but their superior presence. And these bulls wouldn't stop until every girl was carrying their children, the wh\*Te women's original children would probably be neglected. Who the fuck would want to raise these inferior children? They are only going to turn out like their fathers.

&amp;#x200B;

The Men? The men would flee after realizing how futile their attempts at winning back their wives attraction would be. They would flee to Japan where they will try to win over FAS looking ugly Jap girls because they are the only things disgusting and lonely enough to accept them. Many would probably be rejected after the Japs hear of their shameful and dishonorable display, even they probably would have killed themselves to avoid the shame.

&amp;#x200B;

Back home in the once nice town, every woman will be raising their BLACK children and will be queuing up for their second or maybe even third pregnancy. They wont stop until they hit menopause, because they know deep down that their purpose is to populate the world with superior BLACK bulls who will then move on to destroy other towns.

Cornell University initially failed to report to U.S. authorities more than $1.2 billion in foreign funds it has received in recent years, including $760 million related to its campus in Qatar and about $1 million in contracts from Chinese telecom company Huawei Technologies Co., the U.S. Education Department indicated in its latest report on schools and foreign contracts.

The names of Cornell and other universities are redacted in a report the department released Tuesday, but are identifiable based on other details provided in the report and related correspondence by the department with the schools.

The 34-page report provides an update to a broad investigation the Education Department undertook last year into whether U.S. universities are appropriately reporting all foreign contracts and gifts that total more than $250,000 in one year. It isn’t illegal to take such funds, but universities are obligated to disclose them under a statute that is decades old but hasn’t been vigorously enforced in past years.

The department said Tuesday it planned to condition access to participation in federal student-loan programs on compliance with foreign-funding obligations.

The government has expressed concern that foreign money may come with strings attached, provide foreign governments improper access to sensitive research or limit academic freedom in some programs.

“U.S. institutions are technological treasure troves where leading and internationally competitive fields, such as nanoscience, are booming. For too long, these institutions have provided an unprecedented level of access to foreign governments and their instrumentalities in an environment lacking transparency and oversight by the industry, the Department, and our partner agencies,” the Education Department said in its report.

Education Department Investigating Harvard, Yale Over Foreign Funding (Feb. 13)
The Justice Department has been cracking down on violations of a law that requires lobbyists for foreign nationals and governments to publicly disclose that work. A top Republican fundraiser pleaded guilty on Tuesday to a related charge.

Education Department investigators found that “many large and well-resourced institutions of higher education have aggressively pursued and accepted foreign money,” while failing to comply with reporting obligations, according to the new report.

“Evidence suggests institutional decision-making is generally divorced from any sense of obligation to our taxpayers or concern for our American national interests, security, or values,” the report added.

The report said a school, identifiable as Georgetown University, has worked with the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, “derived $2,360,807” from an arrangement that demonstrated “significant intermingling” with China, and supported an academic exchange with Communist officials through the central committee’s Party School.

A Georgetown spokeswoman said the school’s tax filings show a nearly identical dollar amount in expenditures in the region, but not gifts or contracts from foreign entities, and that the details in the report were “a bit puzzling to us.”

U.S. universities have generally defended their international collaborations and said the agency’s reporting requirements were unclear.

A Cornell spokesman acknowledged the university’s past errors in reporting and said it had undertaken significant efforts since July 2019 to file accurate disclosures of the foreign funds.

Since 2019, the Education Department has opened investigations into a dozen top universities including Harvard University and Yale University, finding that U.S. universities failed to report at least $6.5 billion in such funds.

The new report details information the agency received from Georgetown, Texas A&amp;M University, Cornell, Rutgers University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Maryland. The other schools under investigation are continuing to provide information or have yet to provide documents, the report said.

One school, identifiable as Cornell, admitted that it failed to document its institution in Qatar in previous reports to the department, and said it was dumbfounded about how to explain the error, the report said. The university has a branch of its medical school in the Gulf country.

Multiple schools also belatedly reported receiving millions of dollars from Huawei, the report said, referring to the tech giant whose equipment U.S. national security officials have warned could be used for espionage, which the company denies.

American universities largely stopped taking Huawei funds by 2018 based on the U.S. concerns, but many top schools had previously entered into extensive contracts with the company, the report said. The university identifiable as MIT, for example, held around $11 million in contracts and agreements with Huawei since 2013, ranging from research agreements to donations for specific projects and programs, the report said.",0.04107035490964063,0.3512018570054284,ucla

1065,Alex Lang remembers life before the revolution,1,2020-10-21 20:17:18,0,"The year is 2045. The southern United States lives under BLACK RULE. All white males are sissified. White women live to serve BLACK KINGS in vast reproduction facilities. Welcome to America's BLACK FUTURE.

&amp;#x200B;

Alex Lang remembers life before the revolution – before the government-issued hormones, the sissy wigs, frilly lingerie, and mandatory chastity. He lives on the war-torn outskirts of New Africa, where he hides his beautiful blonde step-sister Kaylee from the clutches of the brutal New African army.

&amp;#x200B;

As musclebound black soldiers prowl the countryside searching for fertile white women, Alex will stop at nothing to protect sweet Kaylee's purity. In his pink-and-blue wig, flirty sissy skirt, and fishnet stockings, Alex gives his tender white body to a gang of pitiless black alpha soldiers: the ultimate act of courage and sacrifice. But is sissy Alex prepared for the overwhelming demonstration of power and domination? The encounter brings him face-to-face with his worst fears... and his most unspeakable sissy fantasies.

&amp;#x200B;

Acclaimed author and pro domme Whitney Ryan presents a tantalizingly political vision of the future. Her powerful, vivid, fly-on-the-wall passages of three-on-one interracial man-on-sissy action push the boundaries of sensual fiction. The BLACK KINGS have their way with Alex's sissy body, pumping and pounding and cursing through one of the hottest gang scenes in the history of the genre. And interspersed throughout the sizzling prose, a suspenseful narrative full of imaginative world-building unfolds.

1097,Decision regarding collaboration with Saudi Aramco - thanks and bye!,1,2020-10-28 20:41:18,19,"""September 03, 2020

Dear Faculty Colleagues,

We write to let you know about a decision regarding collaborations  with Aramco, a founding member of the MIT Energy Initiative. After  thorough review and consultations within MIT and Aramco, Aramco’s  membership in MITEI will not be renewed, and new sponsored engagements  between MIT and Aramco will not be considered at this time.

Within MIT, this outcome was informed by extensive consultations and  community input over the past year and a half, and by specific  recommendations from the [International Advisory Committee (IAC)](https://facultygovernance.mit.edu/committee/international-advisory-committee), input from the [Ad Hoc Faculty Committee on Guidelines for Outside Engagements](https://facultygovernance.mit.edu/committee/ad-hoc-faculty-committee-guidelines-outside-engagements#:~:text=The%20Ad%20Hoc%20Committee%20on%20Guidelines%20for%20Outside%20Engagements%20will,MIT%20community%20during%20Spring%202020.&amp;text=Several%20members%20of%20the%20ad,ensure%20coordination%20in%20their%20work), and review by the Senior Risk Group. A full description of this process appeared in the May issue of the [Faculty Newsletter](https://web.mit.edu/fnl/volume/325/lester.html).

Aramco has been a valued research partner for MIT. It is a technical  leader in many areas of engineering and science, and it has provided  many valuable research opportunities for MIT faculty and students which  have contributed to advances in fundamental energy science and  technology. Our researchers have also forged productive individual  working relationships with their Aramco colleagues.

We appreciate the thoughtful consideration that has been given to  this matter by faculty committees and groups and by individual members  of the community.

Sincerely,

Richard K. Lester  
 Associate Provost

Maria T. Zuber  
 Vice President for Research""

1118,How to express concerns about a class (7.06) that does not have a piazza forum on which to do so anonymously + rant,1,2020-11-02 23:48:23,8,"Full disclosure: I am on the A/B boundary for this class so I guess bias may play a part in this but not majorly. 

Question: For other classes in prior semesters (e.g. 8.02) there have been methods to anonymously express concerns about a class through the piazza forum. I (and I believe other students also (cf. below)) wish to anonymously express my concerns about 7.06, or to express my concerns in a safe setting. Are there ways in which to do this? 

&amp;#x200B;

Rant: In my opinion, the tests (93% of the grade) in 7.06 are horribly made. For those not in the class this semester, the questions are extremely vague but graded via a hyper-specific rubric while simultaneously docking for any extraneous information (in whatever way they define that based on the rubric, because again, the questions are very vague). For each of the 7.06 exams so far, I think they were content wise easy, and feel like I did well on them. However, each time, I was hit with an extra minus 10-15% for obscure/(extremely) nitpicky reasons. 

I believe students have complained in class about this before, as there was an email from the instructors with a proposed ""solution"" to this problem: to ask clarification questions about vaguely phrased problems DURING the exam via a google forum. In addition to the fact that the onus should not be on the students to design questions well (and that it can take up time that is supposed to be used on solving the exam), this is also unhelpful, as sometimes questions ask about something specific but have supposed rubric ""answers"" containing what I would consider entirely extraneous information. Basically, we don't know what questions to ask about the badly phrased problems because while taking the test they seem normal, only when comparing them with the rubric do they become respectively vague, unintuitive, or unclear.\* \*with respect to what the rubric was looking for 

I have for a little bit now stopped studying the biology for this class as much/attending class and instead focused on trying to figure out what the instructors want from me on tests (this is something I used to do in high school, and I hate that I have to do it now) -- this has actually helped my grade go up, not down. Singlehandedly this class has made me want to change majors as, although I love biology, I don't feel like focusing more on ""test-taking"" than learning in the future. I didn't have this issue in 7.05 or 7.03 and hope 7.06 is a one-off.",-0.06825462962962961,0.5067962962962962,ucla

The fact is though that this isn't true, and there are a lot of other people who've also been through what we're currently facing, and have made it out the other side stronger. Something that helped me a lot (I've been through pretty severe depression and anxiety in the past) was the help I got from my friends at the time, even if they didn't really know exactly what to do or how to help.

We're building something to make it easier to help the people you care about in similar situations - all while being fully free!

For user testing, this will be a \~45 minute call with out Head of Product, [Chris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-robeck/), who will ask all sorts of random questions about mental health and interactions between friends, and we will compensate $10 for the call.

I am always a humanities student but I know very clearly why MIT lol. I didn’t take calculus in hs but I took Discrete which I knew was necessary for me to succeed in philosophy and did fine. Despite I am pretty certain that course 26 will be for me, I have no idea if there are any pure humanities students. I looked on Niche and it said there are only 3 students in Linguistics and 5 in Philosophy.

Are there pure humanities major students? How would you look at me if came to the school?",0.22382034632034634,0.6645238095238095,ucla

As I'm sure that this subreddit  is full of intellectual minds who have graduated from MIT, I was hoping I could get some advice.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently In a second world country where life Isn't easy, however I'm incredibly lucky to be studying at an engineering High School, meaning I'm learning a lot, as well as university level material (which is part of curriculum) regarding Electronic Engineering, Computer Architecture, Semiconductors, etc....

Learning this kind of material while still in high school Is a blessing for me, but I'm way more ambitious than that.

I want to be surrounded by smart people who wish to contribute to society as I do and I know I can find this at MIT.

&amp;#x200B;

My English skills are similar to a native speaker, so It is hard to tell that It is my second language.

I really want to attend MIT, however I know It's not easy, and I would need to come up with my own path/strategy to make the best out of my time left (I have 1.5 yrs till i finish high school).

&amp;#x200B;

Is It correct that I should attend summer camps or research camps? If so, am I eligible as an Intl. student?

I feel as if I have always been good with technology, and I love screwing around with it. Computer science and electrical engineering are the subjects that interest me currently the most, and I would probably want to have degrees in them. As I am still young, I know by starting with effort now, I could make it easier for myself to achieve the goal of getting into a nice college like MIT.

I have been trying to learn Python, but it seems to be something that takes a lot of time and commitment and could be pretty hard with lots of the stuff currently going on in my life. I also currently have started learning about making semi-basic Arduino and Raspberry Pi projects.

One thing that really catches my concern though, is me wondering if middle school grades and such will make an effect on an application to get into MIT? Due to private reasons, school has been really hard for me recently, and I am not certainly getting '***the best****'* grades at all.

1226,What classes do you actual MIT students recommend I take?,1,2020-12-01 06:04:55,2,"Hello, I'm currently wondering which future classes I could take in high school and if the ones that don't actually have anything to do with my major will affect my chances of being accepted. 

Currently I wish to major in physics in college and I'm wondering for future planning from actual students or faculty at this school if I should still take more AP classes that don't actually have anything to do with math and sciences.

For example, this year I'm taking AP world history. Don't get me wrong now I do like history and writing very much but everyone including my parents (and I'm planning on discussing this same subject with my counselor at some point) is telling me that I'm pretty much just adding a lot for unnecessary stress and work onto myself that I could otherwise use to further my math subjects and focus more attention on those. 

I would still like to finish out this year with doing AP history but I've been wondering now if the physics department at schools like MIT even care about subjects and courses like that and if I ended up not doing the next class in line for AP history would it affect my chances of acceptance at all? I really don't want to add unnecessary stress and energy that I could otherwise use to fuel more towards the classes that I will actually be majoring in college and probably end up getting worse grades in all of my other classes just because of this unnecessary work. But I would also like to know because if it is something I probably am highly advised to have a good chance of getting into a school like that then I may just have to power through it. And this question can go for any Ivy League or elite-type school out there as well I'm sure, although departments do differ. Just need some opinions so I can better plan out what I will do next semester and in the coming years of high school before I starting sending in applications.

3rd year undergrad CompSci based in Scotland here. Visited Boston in the summer after highschool and fell in love with the schools. Being a STEM student, MIT is the fit for me. I'm a decent student, and have passed every academic year with distinction. My grades from highschool allowed me to enter University a year earlier vs the average student, and I am set to intern at a bank in the UK this summer. I still have 4th year to go, and then I will graduate. 

Should my internship experience go sour, or I feel like it isn't for me, I will likely shift my focus to postgraduate study. 

I am currently exclusively studying CompSci - it is not a blended course. Every class I have sat is in some shape or form related to Computer Science. This includes elective classes I chose. 

I am not very well versed on postgraduate study at all, and likely only want to study for a 1 year or 2 (2 maximum). This would make a masters degree ideal. However, I've read from multiple sources that this wouldn't be available to me, as I am not an MIT undergrad. 

* Does this leave my only option to study for a Doctorate? 
* What type of research do postgrad students generally contribute to at MIT? 
* What programs do Computer Science students generally take moving forward, after graduation?
* Given the economic climate, do you think there are more postgrad courses on the horizon (by the time I graduate in 2022)? 
* Do you think given my situation, perhaps another school would suit me better? 
* And lastly - Is there someone in the University I can reach out to, and have a chat with perhaps over Zoom or the like? I've tried emailing admissions to no avail. I was supposed to Exchange at the University of Waterloo this academic year, and I was able to arrange such a meeting before the final decision was made to go or not. (I decided not to in light of the pandemic, and my thirst for international study has grown stronger than ever).

Should/can I petition out of the 14.01 requirement if I received a 5 on the AP Micro exam? I've heard about some people who've done it but I wanted to know if people thought it was a good idea? (I'd try to take 14.19 this semester if I went through w/ it if that helps.)

Also, is 18.600 usually a viable substitution for classes with a 6.041 or 14.30 prereq? I know 14.12 has 6.041B as a prereq (although that class doesn't exist anymore) and 14.32 requires 14.30. Since 6-14 allows you to choose one of 14.30/18.600/6.041 but also requires 14.32, I was wondering if there was any flexibility with 14.32's prereq?

I applied EA to MIT as an international applicant, and I wanted to ask you two questions :

1. I plan to major in poli sci and eventually economics, what about the amount of work? I know that MIT is a demanding institution with a lot of work, however I would like to have a comparative elements with what is considered as a ""hard"" curriculum in my country (I'm french). So if any french student goes by, is the amount of work similar to ""The classes préparatoires""?

2. I'm really anxious regarding the quality of my application; even though I have honestly a great GPA ans Ranking in my system (4.0 and 1st) and ok ECs and Essays, I cannot destress. Are their any current alumnis that had similar fears and got admitted ? Or the contrary, so I know that I should not have high hopes ?

18.02 multivariable calculus

6.009 intro program design

6.004 intro EE (supplementary)

18.06 intro linear algebra

6.006 intro algorithms (supplementary)

6.031 intermediate program design (haven't personally taken yet and I'm told there's lots of busy work irl, but it's an important thing to learn)

\-- classes I'd recommend to someone with a solid CS base start here --

6.034 intuitions about ML (haven't personally taken, taught by Prof. Winston, not sure what it's like since then)

6.008 intro inference (haven't personally taken, but taught by Greg and Paulina whom I trust to teach a good class)

6.041 intro probability (really good, rigorous, hard class as of spring 2018, but I'm told they changed it so 6.436 might be a better option now)

6.046 intermediate algorithms (supplementary, super fun tho, reminds me why I got into CS)

18.065 linear algebra for ML (taught by Prof. Strang, who both literally and figuratively wrote the book, gives good intuitions and reviews the basics)

6.436 intro probability (again; grad, haven't taken, see note on 6.041)

6.867 classical ML to neural networks (grad, same kind of vibe as Murphy's ML book)

6.438 algorithms for inference (grad, sister class to 6.437 that's more approachable for CS students)

9.520 statistical learning methods (grad, changes content yearly, see CBMM youtube; this class in 2018 had the best explanation of GANs I've ever seen)

6.437 inference and information (grad, my favorite class, not on OCW iirc, one of my friends got a 2/30 on the 3 hour midterm worth 35% that had 3 questions; only Paulina, Greg, and Gauss truly understand this stuff)

6.172 performance engineering (supplementary, great content and projects, lots of stupid small stuff irl)

6.824 distributed systems (supplementary, well put together, but lectures are mostly just rehashing the readings; taught by rtm, who built the first internet worm)

6.803 seminar in ML (grad, legendary class taught by Prof. Winston, tried and failed to get in before he died; may he rest in peace, he truly made the world a better place)

Most are on OCW too I think. You can look at prereqs for a more complete picture, there's some overlap, some classes are taught better than others, start where you feel comfortable, skip what you know, midterms/finals are online for context.

For the confident, go backwards for trial by fire followed by intolerable boredom. Gets you good internships tho.

1274,New residency requirement sprung on graduate students,1,2020-12-10 18:53:10,5,"Out of the blue, international graduate students were notified this week that they will not be paid in the Spring unless they are living in the US.  In some departments, all classes and advising will be online, but this does not matter.  Because this requirement did not exist in the Fall, there are students in other countries with long-term leases, children in schools, spouses with jobs, no visa, US bank account or arrangement for local housing, whose plans are suddenly upended. The text makes clear that this policy change is for bureaucratic convenience of MIT and not a mandate from the government.  Within MIT, the decision was apparently made without consulting the departments. You can imagine how many students are freaking out. 

The new policy is [https://covid-team2020.mit.edu/remote-appointments/](https://covid-team2020.mit.edu/remote-appointments/) but since that site is restricted to MIT users only, I copied relevant text below.

**Graduate Students**  
RA, TAs, and Fellows: ***Graduate students with RA, TA, or fellowship appointments in Spring 2021 are being asked to return/come to the U.S. by January 30, 2021, in order to maintain their appointments***. A graduate student may be eligible to conduct their RA,TA, or fellowship appointment from abroad only if:

* Visa delays, travel restrictions, border closures, and other COVID-related factors prevent their travel to the U.S.; 
* The student or a member of the student’s household has been instructed by a medical provider not to travel to the U.S. for medical reasons; or
* The student is caring for a family member with COVID-19 or other illness.

If a graduate student with an RA, TA, or fellowship appointment is unable to return to/enter the U.S. for the above reasons, and they meet the other criteria listed below (see FAQ), the student should contact their graduate administrator who will submit an [intake form](https://mit.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6txpJ8RUbGpbY9v) for the student’s remote international appointment.

**These requests will be reviewed individually to determine what options, if any, may be available to the student. Therefore, any student who believes they will need to purse their RA, TA, or fellowship appointment from abroad in Spring 2021 should immediately begin working with their department/program.**

Hourly Paid Appointments: Graduate students are not permitted to have hourly-paid appointments from outside the U.S. during Spring 2021 term. Intake forms should not be submitted for these students.  


**Why is MIT changing its guidelines for remote student appointments conducted from outside the U.S.?**  
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, MIT has supported hundreds of students pursuing their appointments remotely from abroad. As we explained in our [previous guidance and FAQs](https://covid-team2020.mit.edu/remote-appointments/), these remote international appointments pose a number of logistical, compliance, and financial challenges for both MIT and those working remotely abroad. To address these challenges, MIT set up a new process in May to review and facilitate these appointments on a temporary basis. The process was updated in August to include specific guidance for the Fall 2020 term.

MIT has reviewed and approved over 800 requests for students to pursue their appointments from outside the U.S. Many of these requests were for students who remained in the U.S at the start of the pandemic, but who wished to return home to pursue their studies and appointments in their home communities.

We are pleased that so many students were able to pursue their appointments this summer and fall from the locations that worked best for them. Unfortunately, given the increasing challenges posed by these international appointments—including the duration of many of these appointments, the fluid situation relating to the pandemic, and the relevant external guidance—we need to modify our approach beginning with the Spring 2021 term.",0.07513175230566535,0.33715415019762845,ucla

1337,Seth Lloyd Update,1,2020-12-20 02:29:11,8,"To the members of the MIT community,

Following the Goodwin Procter report on MIT’s interactions with Jeffrey Epstein, President Reif asked that I create a process to review its findings about Professor Seth Lloyd and to identify any appropriate action. I created a two-part review and decision-making process with two faculty committees: one to review facts and determine, based on those facts, whether Professor Lloyd violated any MIT policy, and the second to recommend disciplinary action, if necessary. I write today to share the results of this intensive two-stage effort and the decision I have reached. 

Before I begin, I would like to emphasize that I am taking the unusual step of sharing this information with our entire community because of the unique public nature of the case and its impacts. Professor Lloyd knows that I am taking this step, and he understands and accepts that the outcome of this disciplinary process should be shared openly.

The Review Panel

I assembled a panel of five senior faculty leaders from across the Institute and asked them to determine if Professor Lloyd violated MIT policies. The members of the panel were Professor Rohan Abeyaratne, Institute Professor Daron Acemoglu, Institute Professor Penny Chisholm, Materials Science and Engineering Department Head Jeffrey Grossman, and Dean of Science Nergis Mavalvala (chair). The panel members reviewed the Goodwin report as well as other documents they deemed relevant and met with a number of individuals, including the Goodwin fact-finders and Professor Lloyd, several times.  

Based on this review, a majority of the members found that, in connection with donations he received from Epstein in 2012, Professor Lloyd violated MIT’s conflict of interest policy (Policies &amp; Procedures 4.4) by failing to inform MIT that Epstein was a convicted sex offender and that, in doing so, he violated MIT’s policy on faculty misconduct (Policies &amp; Procedures 3.4.2). A minority of the members could not conclude one way or the other that his actions violated the conflict of interest policy. 

The full panel further determined that he did not violate any MIT policies in accepting a gift from Epstein in 2005–2006 and a donation in 2017. The panel members did not find that Professor Lloyd tried to circumvent the MIT vetting process nor that he sought to conceal the name of the donor. They did conclude, however, that he failed to reveal crucial information about Epstein’s background to anyone at MIT.

The Evaluation Committee

The panel submitted its findings to a separate evaluation committee consisting of Dean of Engineering Anantha Chandrakasan, Mechanical Engineering Department Head Evelyn Wang, Physics Department Head Peter Fisher, Mechanical Engineering Associate Department Head Pierre Lermusiaux, and Faculty Chair Rick Danheiser. The evaluation committee convened several times, including meetings with the review panel members and with Professor Lloyd. Based on the panel’s conclusions, the evaluation committee recommended a set of disciplinary actions, which they stated ""focused on Professor Lloyd’s poor judgment and the impact of his actions on the community, which he may not have yet fully appreciated.""

My Decision

After conferring with senior administrative and faculty leaders, as well as the two committees, I have decided to implement the recommended disciplinary actions. 

For a period of five years, a set of disciplinary actions will limit Professor Lloyd’s compensation, his ability to engage in solicitation of donors and foundations, and his involvement in first-year undergraduate advising, and will impose several other restrictions on normal privileges accorded to a faculty member. In addition, Professor Lloyd will be expected to undergo training on professional conduct before resuming certain activities on campus, including teaching. 

These steps cannot undo the harm done. Professor Lloyd’s failure to share what he knew about Epstein’s conviction when he accepted his 2012 donations was unacceptable. His interactions with Epstein and certain of his actions surrounding acceptance of the donations serve to highlight the importance of the current Institute-wide effort to develop clearer guidelines for engaging with donors. 

I recognize that many in our community remain deeply disturbed by the interactions with Jeffrey Epstein and that some will be disappointed by this decision. In addition, for some, this outcome may renew past pain. If you feel you would benefit from support or guidance at this time, you can find a range of resources here.

I would like to close by extending my gratitude to the entire MIT community for your engagement, your candor, and your care for MIT.

Sincerely,

Martin A. Schmidt",0.04241854636591478,0.4416979949874687,ucla

I also have quite a bit to write about it, and I wasn't sure if Admission Officers just skimmed over the job description.

1370,An MIT x Harvard love story from r/ApplyingtoCollege,1,2020-12-26 04:21:02,6,"Footsteps echoed softly against the cobblestone. It was a foggy, overcast morning in Cambridge, and the grey clouds overheard seemed to be saturated with moisture — just waiting to burst. Harvard jogged absently through the side streets, having woken up at dawn to get in an early morning run. He was tall and lean, his body toned from all those days toiling on the lacrosse field. As he ran, his platinum blonde hair bounced around; it was neatly trimmed but still floppy. His bright green eyes reflected the grassy leisure spaces embedded throughout the urban sprawl.

Turning the corner onto another side street, Harvard looked nonchalantly around the city at the passersby. He didn’t see the loose cobblestone jutting out from the sidewalk. With a pained yelp, Harvard tripped over the cobblestone and fell flat on his face, his legs getting tangled up between him on the way down. “Ow, ow, ow...” he whimpered quietly, cradling his ankle. It was rapidly turning a bruised purple color, and the throbbing was agonizing. Harvard needed to get back to his dorm. He weakly tried to stand, but white hot pain shot through his injured ankle, and he collapsed back onto the ground. No one would be awake at this hour. There was no one to call for help — not Boston College, not Amherst, not anyone. Realizing how alone he was, Harvard curled into a ball on the sidewalk and began to cry softly.

Meanwhile, another boy walked cheerfully down the sidewalk with extra pep in his step, whistling a chirpy tune. It was MIT on his way home from the lab. His dark, glossy brown hair was mussed with bed head, but his cerulean blue eyes were wide awake and alert. He had woken up in the middle of the night and stumbled through the dark streets of Cambridge, making his way to the lab to work on his botany experiment. To MIT’s delight, his project was a success, and he giddily fantasized about displaying his work of excellence at the next international science fair.

Snapping out of his raunchy science fair daydream, MIT frowned in confusion when he saw another student his age huddled on the cobblestone, nursing their ankle and shielding their face. Recognition raced through his mind when he saw a flash of soft blonde hair. Oh no. It was his longtime rival Harvard. MIT turned to leave, wanting to avoid another run-in with the somewhat obnoxious boy. He thought back to all those evenings when he would be walking home after a long day at the lab, passing by where Harvard lived. The other boy would always be partying with his rowdy final club friends — blasting that annoying music. Sometimes, they even mocked MIT for the long hours he put into his botany experiments. Never mind the fact that Harvard spent many an hour in the Houghton Library, salivating over manuscripts and leather-bound books, the literature snob that he was. Flushed with irritation at the thought, MIT started to walk away, but then he heard it.

Muted sobs filled the air. MIT examined Harvard carefully and noticed his shoulders were shaking. He bit his lip apprehensively, feeling a pang of compassion for his enemy. MIT crept closer to the other boy  — as if approaching a wounded animal — and extended a tentative hand, lightly touching Harvard on the shoulder. 

Startled, Harvard flinched away and gazed up at his approacher. His fair skin was flushed pink with distress, and his brilliant green eyes scanned the face of the other boy tearfully. “Go away, MIT,” muttered the hurt blonde, hiding his face behind his hands. “Come to kick me when I’m down? Just leave me alone.” MIT fidgeted nervously, regretting his choice to come over and see what was wrong. His conscience wouldn’t allow him to simply walk away from someone in pain, even if that someone was, well, Harvard. “Mind-mind if I take a look?” spluttered MIT. The hurt boy wouldn’t meet his eyes, and awkward silence hung in the still air. “Al-alright...I guess I’ll leave you alone,” stammered the brunette. 

As MIT turned quickly away, hoping to flee and escape his embarrassment, lightning split the stormy grey skies. All at once, the formidable clouds seemed to break open, and cold rain drops pelted the earth below. The Boston air grew still more chilly and unforgiving. With a sudden gasp, Harvard abruptly burst into tears again, curling up in a defensive ball. MIT just stood there, staring uncomfortably at his rival. What kind of cold-hearted monster would he be to leave the injured blonde alone out here, sitting on the sidewalk and sobbing in the pouring rain? MIT went into a mild panic imagining all the horrible illnesses Harvard could catch out here in the cold — pneumonia, hypothermia, chilblains, oh my!

MIT worked up his courage and marched over to Harvard with renewed determination, reaching out a firm hand. “Give me your hand,” he said gently. Harvard eyed the dark-haired boy distrustfully. He extended a pale, trembling hand. MIT hauled Harvard to his feet with surprising ease. The blonde lacrosse player was toned but slender. “Ow, ow, ow!” he squealed, collapsing in slow motion as his bruised ankle gave out. “I can’t walk,” he mumbled, his breathing labored. 

Then MIT did something that shocked them both. He leaned down and scooped Harvard up into his arms, then began walking briskly down the cobblestone. The lacrosse player panicked, flailing wildly in terror. “Don’t drop me! Don’t drop me. Please don’t drop me,” he repeated insanely, skeptical that the science nerd could even carry his weight. MIT rolled his eyes at the overdramatic blonde. “Relax. We might be rivals, but I would never really hurt you.” Harvard stopped struggling and eyed his blue-eyed rescuer curiously. Seeming somewhat comforted by that statement, the final club boy rested his head against MIT’s surprisingly toned chest and closed his eyes, completely exhausted. The science nerd and the preppy blonde were both drenched in freezing rain. Harvard began to shiver with cold, prompting MIT to break into a bizarre speed walk.

***********************************************

At last, MIT entered his sanctuary — the botany lab. It was a beautiful place, where sleek microscopes and futuristic technology met exotic plants from all around the world. But more importantly, it was safe and dry, and there was a warm bed in the corner. MIT had found it prudent to put a small cot in the lab, considering how often he pulled all-nighters while working on his intricate experiments. The  brunette strode over to his cot and carefully extricated himself from the sleeping body in his arms, dropping the blonde onto the soft mattress. As Harvard stirred, MIT raced around the lab in a hurry, gathering various plant ingredients. He fiddled with lime green serums and smoking potions. He mashed plant herbs with a mortar and pestle, blending it all up into a gritty dark green paste. 

Beaming with satisfaction at his own brilliance, MIT jogged over to Harvard, who was now wide awake and cradling his black and blue ankle. “Harvard,” MIT called softly. “Can I see your ankle?” The preppy boy eyed him fearfully, scooting away from the botany nerd. He didn’t trust that crazed mad scientist look in the MIT’s eye. “What will you do to me?” Harvard whimpered in pain. “It’s my experiment for the next international science fair. I’ve already tested it out, and I’m quite confident that I’ll be winning the grand prize. I was going to save my first batch and unveil it before all the judges, but...I can’t sit you and watch you suffer,” MIT explained, blushing. The blonde boy would normally snicker at MIT’s geekiness, but this time he simply conceded. “Okay. I trust you.” 

MIT smiled disarmingly and took Harvard’s slender ankle in his hand, taking care not to further damage the deep purple wound. He rubbed his gritty plant paste onto the delicate skin. Harvard watched in awe as the bruises faded before his eyes, ruptured skin sealing and leaving a smooth, fair complexion in its wake. His pain dissolved into a ghostlike tingling sensation that soon disappeared. “What-how-“ sputtered the blonde athlete in disbelief. “There. Good as new,” MIT promised with a small, teasing grin. “Your lacrosse buddies might not even believe you if you tell them what happened. Who doesn’t love science? Just remember that next time you guys taunt me on my way to the lab.” Harvard chuckled lightly, his lovely green eyes full of gratitude.

“You can stay here and rest if you want. Nobody comes into the lab on Sundays. Well, except me, I guess —“ Harvard interrupted MIT’s rambling, closing the distance between them with a tender kiss. Soft lips crashed and fought playfully for dominance. The rain pitter-pattered against the lab windows, and the aroma of wild jasmine lofted over from the plants nearby. MIT rustled Harvard’s hair with his hands. The blonde smelled expensive — like vintage cologne and foreign spices. Harvard, for his part, planted light kisses down the neck of his dark-haired rescuer. The brunette smelled of hibiscus and dragonfruit from all his time spent with the plants.

MIT excitedly peeled off Harvard’s soaked shirt, revealing the lean muscles and immaculate alabaster skin beneath. The gorgeous blonde mirrored his actions, and soon both boys had been liberated of their clothing. Harvard was stripped bare all the way down to his silky crimson boxer briefs. “Stay,” Harvard murmured between passionate kisses, pulling MIT beneath the covers. The blue-eyed boy acquiesced, slipping under the pristine white sheets. And so they lay together for hours — two enemies cuddling in a warm bed on a grey, rainy morning.

What can I do during my gap year to increase my chances of admissions into MIT’s EECS PhD program?

For some background on myself, I have two bachelor’s degrees in electrical engineering and applied math. During that time I had four industry internships, two with a major semiconductor corporation. I also did three years of undergraduate research. My undergraduate school is not highly ranked. I’m currently getting a master’s degree in electrical engineering, but I do research in the biomedical engineering department. I work on electrical stimulation of the sensation of touch. My graduate school is one of the highest ranked in biomedical engineering, and it is fairly high ranked in electrical engineering.

I’m taking a gap year and I’m leaning towards adjuncting during that time, though as an adjunct I’d have to work another job as well. I could also do internships at a company, or potentially even for NASA (it’s nearby my school). I could do research with another research group at my school. I could also drop all that and try to get a one-year research position at a place like MIT if that’s even possible, though then I’d lose the adjuncting opportunity. What can I do to increase my chances of getting into MIT? I’m a female if that matters at all - not sure if there’s a higher admissions rate for females in EE. In some schools this is true.

1415,Question regarding inclusion of a maker profile within application,1,2021-01-04 07:57:08,5,"I'm graduating high school this year, which means like quite a large percentage of my fellow seniors, I'm going through the lovely headache of selling my soul to *cough* applying to colleges. MIT is one of the top colleges on my list, and I recently learned of the opportunity to submit a maker profile along with the standard application, and I'm really on the fence on whether it'll actually help me, and if it's worth the time. Although I'm sure I have a decent application, being a straight white male with a living in a stable middle class household doesn't really make me stand out all that much. before I continue, I figured it wouldn't hurt to mention I understand that I know I'm incredibly lucky that this was my upbringing, I don't mean it in any sort of bragging manner, it just means I'm slightly concerned I don't have much to make me stand out over every other kid that's applying to MIT this year. Therefore a maker profile would potentially give me a little bit more exposure, and would allow me to include something i wasn't really able to fit into my application. The thing I would probably create my maker profile about would be the go kart project I've been working on for the past year or so. Although I could write for hours about every little detail, I'll give a quick summary, which hopefully will help you understand why I'm torn:

I bought a super neat vintage amusement park track go kart off Facebook Marketplace, and over the last year I've put tons of time and money into fixing, restoring, and replacing components, and I'm super close to having it completely finished. My hypothetical idea would be to take the photos and videos I've taken of my progress along the way and use them to showcase the development of the many skills I've learned through my meticulous disassembly and fixing of all the parts. It's something I'm really passionate about, and its really interesting to me, but I'm not sure if it will have the desired effect for whoever reviews it.

The reason I'm unsure if this would be worthy of a maker profile submission is I've been watching videos from submissions made by students who were actually  admitted to MIT throughout the last couple years, and every one of them has developed some super interesting and fancy gadget where they designed and built it from scratch, coded it, developed it further etc and although I'm perfectly capable of basic coding, 3d modeling things, printing them etc, there's not much to code on a go kart with a gas engine and mechanical cylinder brakes. Not to mention, I didn't really design or even build most of it, it's been more of a, like I mentioned earlier, disassembly and restored rebuild, with the exception being the whole rear drive assembly which is obviously significant, and required a lot of head scratching and 'engineering-y' related thinking, but it's nowhere near as impressive as some of the things I've seen online. I do remember reading that you can actually submit it to different departments, so that the people who review it are most likely to understand what you're talking about, but I highly doubt the people who would look at my maker profile would be any different than those who reviewed the ones I mentioned I saw online. I should probably mention that I haven't actually applied for this yet, because I figure why spend the $15 to begin one when I'm not sure if it's going to work out for me, so if you think I'm missing something silly that explains the answers to my questions, you're probably right, but also I might not have access to the info... unless there's not actually any more info than the page itself and the word document they provide, and in that case the criteria are super general ans this could work. I guess I'm hoping someone with a better understanding of what reviewers are looking for might be able to offer a little insight on why this would/wouldn't work.

Side note: another thing I'm unsure about is the info page about the maker profile says they obviously don't want a bunch of quick snippets of tons of different little projects you've been working on, but rather a few in great detail, which leads me to believe you could talk about multiple things. If I do end up creating one, is it worth mentioning the fpv drones I build and fly? There's a pretty unique crossover with me following my go kart with one of my drones which turned out to make a pretty cool video, and would hopefully show I have more of a life and more interests than slaving over a go kart, but I didn't like, code them from scratch, or build them piece by piece either, so once again, worth or not? That could even lead me to the RC airplanes I build. Atleast these are made from scratch, and they're super neat, but there's not really a connection between them and the go kart like I have with the drones, and I definitely wouldn't be able to make an entire profile revolving around the planes, which is why I've mentioned them last. 

If you want me to expand on anything here please let me know!! I really thank you for your time listening to my late night jumbled thoughts I've randomly decided to spew out here. I'm kinda banking on the fact that none of the MIT staff/reviewers will see this, but if they do magically have reddit and follow r/mit (which now that I think about, isn't actually that unlikely...

Is there any great math summer programs for entering college students? It doesn't have to be research program, or organized at MIT.",0.23409523809523808,0.48233333333333334,ucla

I was curious to find out if it's feasible to shove ALL 8 Humanities requirements into my Freshman Fall Semester? Since all classes during then are on Pass/Fail, is it reasonably possible to cram all of the Reqs into that Semester and try to just barely pass everything? I know it's somewhat unethical and 8 Courses for a first semester is a recipe for absolute pain and suffering but I am unbelievably shit at most things that aren't STEM and if I could utterly maximize my suffering for one Semester and grind out a bunch of passes then I genuinely feel like that'd make everything else so much less of a headache. Thoughts? Is this even allowed? And has anyone here ever tried this?

As a side note, can I take Humanities Courses that feature material I already took in Highschool? I took IB Econ SL, History SL (just for a quarter though, but I took History during my MYP years), and I took French Lang. and Lit., so can I take all those Courses here as free passes?

Now... we all yearn for success and we want to be happy. Why not make that person on the other side of the globe smile while you may not know them. That smile on their face from your contribution can result in something 'big' in your life unexpectedly. It could also result in your university success. That's powerful.

Many of us are struggling financially, but what if we can donate just $1 for the wellbeing of another person. Imagine how many families praying for your wellbeing during a crisis relief while you're doing an assignment. Maybe you might just figure out the answer quickly :) Don't belittle the $1. If 100 students can donate $1 out of goodness, then that $100 that can save plenty of lives/ families.

If we can all do this little thing, it can result in us being heroes in saving humanity. That's what makes us MIT students. We spend years dedicated to creating and innovating for the greater good of humanity. Why not start with something as simple as this.

Something I was just concerned is that when I’m talking to other adMITs, it seems as if all the Course 18s know each other from math competitions/camps, and I haven’t done those things and I’m not currently part of those communities. And while I’ve studied a lot of university-level math in high school, I feel as if I have a weaker foundation since I feel I haven’t studied mathematics in as much depth as other people — though I guess this is a more minor point because I shouldn’t shy away from math just because it’s intimidating.

I’m also interested in the more applied side of things (rather than something like pure math research) and in particular math’s applications in the natural sciences or CS, so I’m thinking about whether a science major would be a better fit for me (or for CS I might just do 18C).

This program provides free, non-credit English as a Second Language (ESL) workshops &amp; conversation hours to international students who want to practice/improve their English skills in a casual environment. These are led by students who are native (or at least near-fluent) English speakers and interested in volunteering to assist international students and/or gaining teaching experience.

Cluster topics can range anywhere from skill-based (i.e. pronunciation) to topic-based (i.e. American movies) to casual conversation-based (i.e. discussion of current events, practicing English by playing games). While the volunteer opportunities in this program are great for those studying to become English/ESL teachers or wanting to teach abroad, we still welcome those who are not. The type of Cluster that you would be able to lead (a more casual conversation hour format vs. one on focused on a specific skill) will depend on your background, knowledge, and experience, but anyone from freshmen to graduate students can participate.

For the Spring, all of these Clusters will be virtual and go from February through April. Clusters meet once a week for an hour and there's a lot of flexibility on the day/time that they can be led. In addition to these Clusters being open to all international students at MIT, we're combining the English Clusters across all of the universities that our organization is at (i.e. NYU, UMass, Drexel, etc.) this Spring since most things are virtual anyway. This means that an international student here can participate in a Cluster led by someone at a different university, and vice-versa.

This fund change will occur during the evening of February 22, 2021. You are not required to take any action. The following is an explanation of the change and when it will occur. 

What Funds Will Be Changed?

The following funds will be replaced:

Current Fund to Be Eliminated	Replacement Fund
Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund Institutional Plus Shares	BlackRock U.S. Debt Income Fund F
Vanguard Total Stock Market Institutional Plus Shares	BlackRock Russell 3000 Index Fund F
Vanguard Value Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock Russell 1000 Value Fund F
Vanguard Growth Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock Russell 1000 Growth Fund F
Vanguard Mid‐Cap Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock Mid Capitalization Equity Index Fund F
Vanguard Small‐Cap Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock Russell 2000 Index Fund F
Vanguard US‐Real Stock Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock FTSE EPRA/NARIET U.S. Index Fund F
Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Institutional Plus Shares	BlackRock MSCI ACWI ex‐U.S. IMI Index Fund F
Vanguard Emerging‐Markets Stock Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund F

If you have invested in any of the current funds listed above, your investments will be moved automatically to the corresponding replacement fund. Your election to have future contributions invested in any of the current funds will also be automatically changed to the corresponding replacement funds. No action on your part is required.

The replacement funds are very similar to the current funds. They are of the same asset class; invest in many of the same securities; and follow a similar, though slightly different, market index. As always, we encourage all Plan participants to review their 401(k) account allocation regularly to confirm that it continues to be compatible with their retirement savings strategy.

Fact sheets for the new funds will be available in early February on the MIT Human Resources website at https://hr.mit.edu/benefits/401k and will also be posted on Fidelity’s NetBenefits website in late February.

When Is the Fund Change Happening?

The fund transfer will be made during the evening of February 22, 2021. Any fund transfers that you request before 4:00 pm EST on February 22, 2021, will be made before the current funds are replaced. Any of your investments that are automatically transferred to the new funds will be available for you to review on the Fidelity NetBenefits website after 7:00 am EST, February 23, 2021.

Why Are the Funds Being Changed?

The Committee regularly reviews the performance and fees of the investment options in the Plan. As part of this due diligence, it compared certain funds in the Plan to outside options with similar characteristics, evaluating their respective performance, index tracking variance, fund transaction costs and fund management fees. After completing its review, the Committee chose to replace the nine funds described above.

Information from Fidelity

Later this week, Fidelity will send you an announcement with detailed information about the fund changes. Please take the time to read the Fidelity announcement so you are fully informed about the changes taking place.

If you have questions, please contact the Fidelity Benefits Center at 877-648-7283 or MIT Benefits at benefits@mit.edu or 617-253-6151.

Does anyone know if MIT allows students to enroll in 2 courses where there might be some lecture timeslot overlap?

1506,Is Environmental science worth it at MIT?,1,2021-01-24 18:38:02,1,"Now, right off the bat, I know MIT has no enviro science major. I'm considering either course 12 or enviro-engineering. However, I am a bit torn. I have already been accepted to MIT (yay EA), and I've applied to both Stanford and Harvard, both of which are ranked higher than MIT for Environmental science on just every list I can find.  


If I get accepted to either of these schools, should I go? I consider myself a pretty weird/ unique/ excitable person (read: BIG aspergers), and the culture at MIT sounds PERFECT for me!! Like, literally perfect. I want to do stupid things with people and create ideas and collaborate to make things come to reality. But I also want to go to a school that will prepare me to help the environment in the best way I can (I am especially interested in sustainable agriculture.) Other schools with more flexible majors than MIT may allow me to better explore my interests in both agriculture and STEM. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before you say ""why don't you consider these schools if/when you get accepted? Don't count your chickens before theyve hatched,"" I am a very anxious person who is exceptionally bad at making decisions. Therefore, I would like as much time to think about this as possible. If I don't get into Stanford or Harvard, TRUST me, I will be very relieved. This means I will not have to make a diffucult decision.
