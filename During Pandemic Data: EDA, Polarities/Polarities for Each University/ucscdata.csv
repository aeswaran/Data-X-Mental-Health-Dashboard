40,CS Fake Friends &amp; Convenience ?,1,2020-03-01 16:11:12,30,"So I know a person X, who at my local community college cheated on his Data Struct &amp; Alg class by posting his programming questions to chegg. I took a screenshot of it and almost turned him in, but I didnt thinking I would never see this person. Plus bad karma... Fast forward to the present this person somehow got into UCSC and can't code to save his life.I know because I use to tutor this person and explain basic concepts like an array, structs, linked list, etc... at CC. As we were taking 101, I being the nice person that I am  helped this person X with his pa assignments ( alot*), and basically passed due my help in pa2, pa3 programming assignments for Tantalo were he amended his class as you needed 70 percent on both portions (programming/theoretical) to pass.  After that class I realized how this person X got so far was by cheating, getting resources (syllabus/hw/), and being chummy to smart people for convenience. Person X saw me struggle and never offered to help with provide materials he gathered, let alone respected my time. After I realized this person X was just using me to get ahead, and he did. I had alot if issues mentally and finally fixed them..., turns out I have something personal that impedes my learning, but with meds I am back to normal and doing great. I went from almost dropping out to a 2.7 in one quarter, and by next quarter expect to be over 3.0 so see caps and use all resources for your mental state. Nevertheless, I now have person X with person Y who both are chummy in the same class, and once again I have been killing it in my upper div class. They ran into me at a study sesh and began to ask me questions about certain concepts. I entertained them for a bit but left immediately with my good friend because I knew what was up. Prior to leaving though person X &amp; Y stated that  the concepts weren't implemented like that according to their old exams (they are retaking the course)..Later that day person Y ask me if I had prev old midterms for this class via text, I said no I dont. I asked person Y as a test of character if they or person X had the exam. They both said no... Fast forward to the midterm you are allowed to hold notes and by some miracle I saw person X and Y have their old exams as there notes. Fortunately I studied my ass off and knew my material so I didnt panick as the exam was changed. Person X sat next to me and as I notated answers I purposely wrote wrong things, and X copied my stuff not knowing what to do... After I readjusted my answers 👍. Now the irony is that the roles are reversed person X and Y have no idea that I have all the finals, midterms, with the best scores ( out of 300 plus) and all versions  for this particular class from the prev quarter. How I got them doesn't matter, but the moral of story is that people will only use you in this school to get ahead, and I could of shared my resources if they had an ounce of character, integrity, and actually viewed me as a human being, but they are the scum of the earth who cheat their way through CS. They no longer speak to me, and act as if I am the bad person... When in all reality I have not cheated to get to where I am and they have. I weighed them and found them less valuable then my feces... Just goes to show you... you should be nice to the people who genuinely are nice to you as well, because you will never know what can happen in the future. Dont use someone convenience at your leisure, because this will come back to bite you in the ass. After all silicon valley is small.

I planned to take both CSE 16 &amp; CSE 101 this spring, but I misread the pre-reqs for 101 and it looks like I can't enroll without having finished 16. This wouldn't be a problem if I could take 101 in summer, but it doesn't look like they're offering it this year. 

The real problem is that if I can't take 101 before fall, I can't take any of my other upper divs, most of which are only offered once a year, so I would wind up staying an extra year just to finish.

Would it be reasonable to do both or should I wait on one?

Overall, how was your experience in Psych100? I'll probably be doing 17 units next quarter (if I make it into 100) and also working so I'm a little worried about workload and time requirements.

If it makes any difference, 100 is with Bonam and 10 is with Manago. I've seen mixed reviews on Manago but am unsure if it would be worth waiting on the class until fall quarter.

I did not come to UCSC for Philosophy, but for another major which this school has a great department for. Upon coming here, however, I found out that I could fit in another major. I've always been quite interested in Philosophy so I thought great, I'll go for that. Here's what my experience has been so far.

I took Intro to Logic last year, and it was good. Nothing stellar but a solid class, wonderful material, good teacher. Then I take Intro to Philosophy, and holy moley, we're talking the straight-up worst class I have ever taken throughout my entire academic experience, grade-school included. Some of you might know which class I'm talking about. I mean, that was enough to make me doubt my choice. But I knew I had to press on. For knowledge. For truth. For the love of wisdom.

And I found it! I took an amazing Philosophy class last quarter, we're talking popularly-famous lecturer levels of quality, passion, and expertise. It's like something people would watch on their own for the sheer interest, myself included. One of the best teachers I've ever had. But then this quarter... I mean, not really. I don't want to be specific about this year's classes for the sake of privacy. But I'm taking a class where the instructor seems to know not much about the details of the material and has little understanding beyond a historical-literary knowledge of these philosophers' work. The students seem to be able to grapple with the ideas with far more acuity than the instructor. On top of that, the instructor mostly reads their lectures off of a piece of paper. And they are a genuinely nice and caring teacher who is genuinely concerned with their students' success, but sometimes that doesn't cut the mustard. The TAs, bless them, are excellent, as have the TAs been for all of my Philosophy classes. That never made much sense to me. It's as if the TAs should be the teachers. Sometimes they actually are, de facto.

Well, what do you all think? I know Philosophy is a small department here, so I might be fishing in a backyard pond, but I really feel the need to talk about it. Because now there is only *one* upper-division Philosophy course offered for next quarter. And it's full. So now what? I guess I might take the opportunity to look elsewhere or even just drop the idea of getting two majors.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Could you help us understand how emotions buffer people against stress experienced by immigrants?  


To participate in this study, you need to be 

1.       International students or second-generation immigrant and

2.       In college or graduate school

You will only take some short online surveys (25 minutes long). We don't collect any information on immigration status or physical address. 1 in 5 participants will win a $25 Amazon gift card. We also got IRB approval. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**This research can help identify more protective factors for immigrants with fewer resources.**  **Further , this study hopes to contribute to reducing health disparities in immigrant families.**  If you are willing to help, please reach me by direct message.

I am at a loss for words rn... this CSE enrollment is straight up awful. My question is what can a non major do to get into an upper div?

The upper divs available this quarter that can satisfy my CSE elective to graduate (Bioinformatics major) are full already and I can't enroll or even waitlist in them until the 10th of march...
The only courses that satisfy this requirement are 
CSE103; 120; 130; 142; 144; 145; and 160/L

Next Questions are about the major

1. If I took APCS in highschool, and I got a 5 on the test, does this mean I get placed into a more advanced programming class?
2. What languages are taught? Since APCS was taught in Java, will I have to learn python or c++ in my free time in order to attend the advanced programming classes?

I started here as a first year in Fall 2017, so logically my expected graduation date should be Spring 2021. Instead they pushed it off another quarter (Fall 2021) even though I actually took 6 extra classes over summers to graduate early. 
Did I make the mistake here, or did advising? I was never informed that I had to change my excepted graduation date, and my UCSC has no way to do it. Advising isn’t responding to my emails.",-0.00555555555555556,0.3148148148148148,ucsc

Coffee - it’s like coffee but sweet. Covfefe
Passionfruit - no idea what it is, but imagine a god tier hi chew ice cream
Peach - peachy, but doesn’t taste like peach. Peachy

**A Tier:**
Mango - hit or miss. Sometimes it tastes like they put the skin in a blender. Sometimes it tastes like peach. You never know
Oreo - if vanilla didn’t exist, this would be the new vanilla. It’s rarity bumps it up into A tier
Coconut - god I love coconut. But people will get mad if I put this in S tier

**B Tier:**
Vanilla - standard stuff
Chocola - ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

**C Tier**
Banana - every time I eat this, reminds of Sammy and I just can’t swallow it down
Strawberry - standard flavor, but it’s always melty. So below B tier
Blueberry - actually best when the flavor isn’t pronounced, but most of the time it feels like something is off

**D tier**
Watermelon - wet. Syrup. It’s like someone took a jar of xanthum gum combined it with used mouthwash, put it in the fridge instead of the freezer, and added pink food coloring.
Guava - how is this any different from water my lawn

**F tier**
This is specially reserved for the subflavors that I’ve literally had to spit out. I have pictures of proof for their existence, but by now they are just myths.
Cinnamon - paired with banana last time I saw it, how can this abomination exist

 I've already booked appointments with CAPS and the DRC. I'm anticipating that CAPS psychiatry won't be able to help me very much in terms of treatment. I know that getting appointments with off campus providers often takes a long time so I'd like to get a start on it sooner rather than later.",0.09229166666666666,0.31833333333333336,ucsc

725,Best way to pay a deposit?,1,2020-03-06 23:43:18,10,"I know this isn’t explicitly UCSC related but since so many people rent off campus I thought I’d ask here! But I understand if mods remove it. 

Basically, i’m moving in with a group of friends and meeting the landlord/signing the lease tomorrow. They all already live here, and it’s been a long chain of people moving in and out and rental deposits becoming confused. Because of this, I want to make sure I have a paper trail when I pay the deposit tomorrow.

The problems are: 
1. my parents don’t speak to me and this is my first time renting (besides a college dorm) so I have no idea what I’m doing 
2. I don’t have a bank location (like an actual walk-in location) anywhere nearby 

The only thing my friends and I can think of is a cashiers bedt (they all paid in cash but I’m not comfortable with that). The problem is, since I don’t have a bank location in the area, I’d have to venmo my friend the money, and she would get the cashiers check from her bank, and it wouldn’t have my name on it. But at least the paper trail would show up in her bank statement and there’s proof that something was paid, right? 

Is there any other way to do this that we’re not thinking of? Is there a way to add a note or my name to the cashiers check, so that there’s proof it’s my money? I don’t have parents I feel so lost! Any advice is appreciated.",0.08938852813852811,0.5255291005291005,ucsc

This means you fucking wash your hands every time you go anywhere and not touch your face. 

I know a bunch of you retards still think its just like the flu and that it is being overblown by the media. Although this may not be as extreme as some are making it out to be, this is NOT YOUR AVERAGE FLU, it is way more infectious with a 20-40x higher mortality rate.  Mortality rate in the United States is at 6% right now because the CDC and our government are doing an absolute shit job at testing. Doctors were not able to test patients who were showing clear corona symptoms because the CDC was not allowing them. There is a massive shortage of working test kits because CDC fucked up and doctors are still not able to test suspected cases. So there are WAY more cases than what is confirmed, and these cases are free to infect others.

I know I am already asking a lot from you degenerates by telling you to wash your hands so there is probably no point in requesting this also but I am still going to put it out there. If you all truly care for your friends and family, you should not take part in or at least limit activities that will increase spread like parties and anything that involves crowds.

""In 2007, my colleagues and I at the University of Michigan Center for the History of Medicine and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [studied the 1918-19 influenza pandemic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17684187), which killed up to 750,000 Americans.

We looked at 43 large cities that carried out some combination of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs): isolating the ill or those suspected of being ill in hospitals or at home; banning public gatherings; in some cases, shutting down roads and railways; and closing schools.

School closing turned out to be one of the most effective firewalls against the spread of the pandemic; cities that acted fast, for lengthy periods, and included school closing and at least one other NPI in their responses saw the lowest death rates.""",-0.030522486772486795,0.463260582010582,ucsc

My only objection is the factor of the coronavirus doubling every week. 
There has been not one but two confirmed cases in Santa Cruz County and many people have travelled back this weekend and came back. I believe that a 300+ student classroom is not the safest place for students to protect themselves from an epidemic that transfers through coughs and touch. Stanford and University of Washington and UC Berkeley have already decided to close schools and go virtual. Many tech companies and businesses have decided to let their employees work from home. Many professors at UCSC have also made classes not mandatory on campus and even some wanted to make the final online in concern of students' health. Instruction is pretty much over with many of the classes being only review sessions and it will cause a bigger issue if one case is to be found later on. It would be extremely helpful if the UC’s also followed this proactive method instead of being reactive when a case is discovered. It is almost bound to happen at this point by the increasing numbers day by day with the lackluster response the United States government and CDC is giving this issue. The virtualization of classes and exams is not going to hinder our education especially when it is done for our safety. With concerns of Lab, most of the instruction/lab work have been completed and the lab is also not the safest place for students to be to protect themselves from the virus. I personally and many of my peers would feel safe and secure if it was not mandatory for me to risk my health and safety to receive a solid education.

I would like it very much if everyone also were to email the admin to urge a right decision.

967,COVID-19: what a lot of people don’t seem to understand.,1,2020-03-10 00:05:58,50,"Preface: I’m not a doctor. But all of this information is basic and doesn’t take a rocket scientist to understand. TLDR at the bottom. 

Are some people being hysterical? Yes. You don’t need a years worth of toilet paper and water to get you through this. But should this be taken lightly? No. 

The reason why COVID-19 should be taken seriously (note: NOT hysterically, seriously) is because of two specific reasons. 

1. We have three different populations at risk. The elderly (in this case, anyone above 50), the very young (infants and children, younger than 2), and the sick (immune-compromised, chronically ill, unable to fend for themselves/ access to healthcare, etc). Do children, young adults, and the able bodied have anything to worry about? Not necessarily. But they will, theoretically, once we get to part 2. *people do not want to spread this to their families.* My own grandfather is at risk, and that’s not a level of guilt id like to live with. But that’s personal. It has a 2 week (approximate) incubation period, which means that you can be asymptomatic, and still contagious. That’s part of what makes this illness dangerous to these populations. You can spread it to the 65 year getting groceries at Safeway without even knowing it, well before you yourself fall ill. 

Onto part 2, and the much scarier aspect of this particular illness. 

2. The reproductive rate is higher than the flu. Quick info on the reproductive rate- estimates are saying it’s hovering around 2.6. (https://academic.oup.com/jtm/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jtm/taaa021/5735319   https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/asia/china-coronavirus-contain.html) 
So for every 5 people infected, 2.6 more will be infected. 5 people sick after one cycle, 18 people after 2 cycles, and so on, till we get to 368 people after 5 cycles. Compared to the flu, which has a reproductive rate of 1.3, which means 5 people sick after 1 cycle, to 45 people sick after 5 cycles. For more details, feel free to check out the New York Times link above. For more information on reproductive rates of viruses, specifically COVID, see the academicoup link above. 

Bottom line, is this virus moves *quickly*. But that’s not the serious part. The scary
part, is that our healthcare system is not equipped to contain or provide for the amount of people becoming sick all at once. *we only have a certain number of beds, per hospital, which is drastically lower than our population*. Let’s look at California, for instance. In California, we have 1.9 beds for 1,000 people. Statewide. (https://www.healthleadersmedia.com/strategy/california-has-fewer-acute-care-beds-population-other-big-states). How many people will need to be hospitalized for this illness, we don’t know. But that number should worry you. If we overload our healthcare system, purely based off of number of beds available for patients who need to either be admitted or receive treatment, *our healthcare system will not be able to properly prevent, treat, or triage patients fast enough or appropriately*. We simply do not have the capacity. 

And that’s not the end of it. If you want to look at ratios related to healthcare workers PPE (personal protective equipment: gloves, N95 mask, hazmat-type suits, etc, which by the way, can only be used once, and once you take it off, it’s no longer sanitary or able to be used again) *we do not have enough PPE for every healthcare worker to continue to change PPE frequently or safely. That includes people like paramedics, hospital clerical workers, nurses, etc.* And when that happens, you will quickly begin to see a decline in the amount of people able to provide care, and the amount of people able to *maintain* care to those who need it. I haven’t even begun to include things like oxygen tanks, oxygen masks, saline bags (fluid), needles, etc, which will also begin to run out. (Side note: car accidents are still going to happen. If you get in a car accident and go to the hospital for, let’s say, a broken arm, you will not be able to receive adequate treatment or care, and you’ll get to go home with a brand new case of the ‘rona on top of your broken arm. Sound fun?)  

When, and if, this decline occurs, we will begin to see an uptick in deaths related to this illness. *Not because they died of the illness itself, but because they died of inadequate care.* Care they would have otherwise received had we *slowed the virus down*. This is what partly occurred in Wuhan, and in other provinces in China. They were not able to adequately provide care, or contain the spread of the virus fast enough. 

We have to slow the spread of this illness. This means being proactive, not reactive. Things that are proactive include washing your hands, *schools (coughUCSCcough) switching to online classes because it’s a cesspool of germs*, not attending events with large crowds, and self quarantining if you think you have the virus or even if you don’t. Be mindful, watchful, and *wash your damn hands*. Don’t go to the grocery store unless you absolutely have to. Stock up for 2 weeks instead of 1 week, purchase staple goods. Wear gloves, don’t touch your face, etc. 

TLDR
This isn’t cause for hysteria. This is cause for seriousness and measured concern. Most of us will end up getting the virus at some point or another, which is ok. But if we don’t contain the virus and slow the progression while we can, that is what’s going to contribute to the amount of deaths this virus may end up causing. If we are proactive about the spread, we can prevent our healthcare system from being overloaded, and we can continue to prevent preventable deaths from occurring. 

Wash your hands. Thank you for coming to my ted talk.",0.04447016382310501,0.5201274934216112,ucsc

995,UC Santa Cruz suspending in-person classes in response to coronavirus (COVID-19),1,2020-03-10 11:07:15,28,"To: UC Santa Cruz Community

From: Chancellor Cynthia Larive

Subject: URGENT: UC Santa Cruz suspending in-person classes in response to coronavirus (COVID-19)

Today we are implementing new campus actions designed to help limit coronavirus (COVID-19) risk on campus. Importantly, there are no confirmed cases on our campus at this time; however, we recently learned that a second case has been identified in Santa Cruz County and the number of cases in neighboring Santa Clara County continues to rise. As local, national, and global public health recommendations increasingly shift to efforts to mitigate transmission by social distancing, UC Santa Cruz is proactively taking steps to protect our campus community.

In our assessment of the current situation, we believe that this is the best action for our campus and the broader Santa Cruz community. These measures are effective beginning Wednesday, March 11, and will remain in place through the first week of the spring quarter. A decision on what will happen after April 3 and beyond for the spring quarter will occur at a later date, based on the latest coronavirus information available. Timely updates will be emailed and posted on the UCSC COVID-19 website. 

INSTRUCTION

Beginning Wednesday, March 11, lecture courses (including discussion sections) and seminars will be offered through alternative modalities (e.g., Zoom) to reduce face-to-face interactions as much as possible. 

Lab and studio courses that must meet in person because alternative instruction outside of the classroom is not appropriate can continue to meet in person where necessary. 

In-person winter quarter final exams will be conducted via alternate means - not in person. Instructors will be communicating with their students this week about alternative plans for assessment on a course-by-course basis.

The first week of spring quarter, Monday, March 30, though Friday, April 3, will also follow this model with lecture courses and discussion sections delivered remotely. 

EVENTS

Per CDC guidance, crowds should be avoided. As such, all campus-sponsored events with plans for more than 50 attendees (based on county guidance) will be canceled or postponed. These include events put on by the administration or academic departments and scheduled to take place through Friday, April 3. Further guidance will be forthcoming regarding student organization events.

For campus-sponsored events with fewer than 50 attendees, we strongly encourage planners of those events to explore alternatives to in-person gatherings. 

CAMPUS OPERATIONS

The campus is not closing. Campus buildings will remain open, and many campus operations, including student housing and dining, health services and research support operations, will continue to provide services, though some services may be modified as conditions change. 

While the campus will remain open, we encourage all students who are able to do so return to their permanent residence and continue their studies remotely through April 3. We know this is not possible for all students, however reducing the number of people on campus will increase the safety of all, and allow those who remain on campus to better practice social distancing. Additional guidance about the spring quarter will be provided prior to April 3 based on the latest available coronavirus information. 

Some limitations in operations and services may arise as managers may be allowing their employees to work remotely, when possible. More communications to managers and employees about working remotely will be provided shortly. In addition, a message outlining additional adjustments to campus operations, events and travel will be issued shortly.

We understand that implementing these changes with such limited notice may be challenging and disruptive, and we appreciate your patience and cooperation. The safety of our campus community is our highest priority. We are grateful to the community members throughout our campus for their tremendous efforts during these challenging times, especially our front-line staff who serve in health care, custodial, and food service roles.

We will continue to update you on this issue with the latest information on our COVID-19 webpage or the Office of the President’s COVID-19 webpage.

Please continue to look out for each other and to show kindness and support to all members of our campus community. Students, please share this message with your families and any concerned parties.",0.14565360235003094,0.4701917130488558,ucsc

1110,I just got an A (and graduated college) without needing to take the final,1,2020-03-11 08:31:03,28,"Shouts out to all the stupid shit that happened this quarter. 

I still hate like 25% of you but the rest of you are cool

Here are tips none of you asked for:

1) play the points game if you don't already. Do every homework. Participate, and go to class. It makes taking the final for any classes easier once you figure out what % you need to get on the final to pass or get a good grade.

To those thinking ""wait, you guys don't do that already?"" I had to tell 8 people so far about it. 

2) your body is in a period of slow decline that will start to affect you around 22. Start taking care of yourself. Jog, go to the gym, eat better. Ingrain these routines into your life now because it'll be significantly easier than later

3) for all of you introverts out there, learn how to tell stories and learn how to ask questions. A conversation is a series of asking open ended questions and answering open ended questions (sometimes without anyone asking them). Take the improv class here. Make friends. Reconnect with the people you like from highschool now if you haven't already. It's only going to get harder to out of college.

4) take as many classes as you can at a community college. Doing so fulfills the same requirements, is cheap as shit (think $40/ unit vs $281/unit), and the quality of professors is generally better when you integrate searching for classes at UCSC with searching for classes at a CC. Again, some people will be thinking ""we already knew that"". Trust me, there's people that go here that think taking community college courses is below them, when in reality I've had a greater number of Berkeley, Standard and Ivy league professors lecture be at CCs than at UCSC and SJSU when I went there

5) I stopped  smoking weed daily at 19 and my GPA shot up from a 2.8 to a 3.70 just off of being able to concentrate on shit and having a better attention span. It also stopped by frequent anxiety after a couple months of going cold turkey. Half of you should strongly consider it

6) volunteer, get to work, or START A SIDE PROJECT ALREADY YOU STEM MAJORS. I had a district lack of motivation starting coding projects because I needed someone to bounce ideas off of. talk to people in your classes. Join the data science club or club that piques your interest. Talk to UGR and get to talking with professors about letters of rec and research. 


7) manage your course load properly. Take 2 harder classes AT THE MOST coupled with 1 GE or easy course along side them. You're not as good of a multi Tasker than you think you are. Also, a professor recently told me that 33% of students graduate in 4 years and 67% graduate in 6 years. Graduating in 4 is an old standard and you slow down and absorb the quality education that you're paying for.

This is a primarily academic approach to studying historical combat, and as such, we will be reading the translated manuscripts from the Medieval Era.

&amp;#x200B;

**We will primarily be studying the works of:**

* 14th Century German Fencing Master [Johannes\_Liechtenauer](https://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Johannes_Liechtenauer)
* 14th Century Italian Fencing Master [Fiore de'i Liberi](https://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Fiore_de%27i_Liberi)

We will practice Longsword, Dagger, Spear, Staff, and (if you're comfortable with it) Italian wrestling—which the entire Italian system is built off of.

**These are** **video examples** **of the kind of work that we will be doing in the club:**

* [**Italian Longsword**](https://youtu.be/4GoQlvc_H3s?t=150) **(Minor Epilepsy Warning) (""Action"" Movie)**
* [German Longsword](https://youtu.be/Q2BU1HnpmVM?t=22) (Instructional)
* [Italian Spear](https://youtu.be/vTZVqPjznDw?t=260) (Instructional)
* [Italian Dagger and Wrestling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENirePvsJjs&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=96) (Instructional)
* *~~""~~*[*~~Pommel Throwing~~*](https://youtu.be/xlLbcubmfhk?t=4)*~~"" (Not really)~~*
* [~~Critical Hits~~](https://youtu.be/kTw4ddJfS7Q?t=20) ~~(Not Instructional)~~

&amp;#x200B;

We will be using **practice (not real) training weapons** made out of polymer.

Currently I have [two](https://www.woodenswords.com/Type_III_Pentti_Longsword_50_p/type-iii-50.gry.htm) training [swords](http://www.kultofathena.com/product.asp?item=PR9052), two training [kukris](https://www.amazon.com/Cold-Steel-92R35Z-Kukri-Trainer/dp/B019RSYLNC) (not European), a 6' practice [spear](https://www.celticwebmerchant.com/en/cold-steel-rubber-spearhead-trainer.html), a6' practice [staff](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1383/9791/products/1_03270c3a-b808-402a-b3af-6786278b14c7_grande.jpg?v=1556813703), and two [hands](https://thehemaists.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/auerswald_65.jpg). I am looking into acquiring training daggers, but daggers can be easily substituted by a sharpie or a toothbrush in the meantime.

&amp;#x200B;

I am by no means an expert instructor in HEMA, with only a years worth of experience. I do want to make this a type of ""study"" group that looks to collaboratively analyze and interpret old manuscripts such as this passage.

&gt;[*We are two guards*](https://wiktenauer.com/images/thumb/b/bd/MS_Ludwig_XV_13_22r-a.jpg/400px-MS_Ludwig_XV_13_22r-a.jpg) *that are similar to each other, and* [*yet each one is a counter*](https://wiktenauer.com/images/thumb/3/3a/MS_Ludwig_XV_13_22r-b.jpg/400px-MS_Ludwig_XV_13_22r-b.jpg) *to the other. And for all other guards in this art, guards that are similar are counters to each other, with the exception of the guards that stand ready to thrust—the Long Guard, the Short Guard and the Middle Iron Gate. For when it is thrust against thrust the weapon with the longer reach will ZTr1k3 first. And whatever one of these guards can do so can the other.*  
&gt;  
&gt;\-Fior di Battaglia, Sword in Two Hands

**Would you be interested in joining?**

I'm considering running the club nighttime on Wednesdays and (possibly) Friday nights, around 7 to 8:30 pm.

Meetings will (hopefully) take place in the OPERS Martial Arts Room.

This style of weapons study differs a bit from [SCA](https://cantonofmiddlegate.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/luke-v-ben.jpg?w=368&amp;h=244) and [LARP](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w9umm0m08bM/maxresdefault.jpg), as it takes a manuscript first approach.

It's much more distracting than you think and it makes it much harder for the professor to find questions that are actually related to the lecture. Discussing the material with peers is a great way to solidify your understanding of it but save it for office hours, discussion section or a study group. Frick.

As of now, I'm going to take the online final and pass the class, but I basically don't understand the second half of the class material and didn't learn any of it- like memorizing the reagant reactions and their steps. 

I could just pass and forget about it without trying to learn it all, but I'm going to take 8B next quarter and It's really been pitched to us that organic chemistry is like learning a second language. Am i going to be fucked next quarter if I don't learn this stuff? Or is the material in 8B not directly reliant on 8a? 

I want to be able to get a fresh start and actually opt-in to properly enjoying the class next quarter (even if it's online class god damn) because I love chemistry. 

Any advice appreciated and also if you're in my class I would love any1 to study with&lt;3

To: UC Santa Cruz Community
From: Chancellor Cynthia Larive
Subject: URGENT: UCSC to adopt remote instruction for duration of the spring quarter
 
I write today to announce that the suspension of in-person instruction, lectures and discussion sections is now extended to the full spring quarter. We also will continue with remote final exams at the end of spring quarter, June 8-12.

Since I last wrote to you on Tuesday, additional information has emerged about the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and its rapid spread. It is a crisis of enormous scale and human impact, the likes of which we have not seen in our lifetimes. We made this difficult decision to extend remote instruction following consultation with campus leadership, the Academic Senate, and the UC Office of the President. It is intended to better protect the safety of all members of the UCSC community by enhancing the ability to practice social distancing.

This does not mean campus is closing for spring quarter. Campus will remain open. Most support services for students, including counseling, advising, and tutoring, will be delivered via Zoom. Over the next two weeks, departments and instructors will evaluate the extent to which laboratory and studio courses can be offered in person with appropriate social distancing or whether they can transition to remote instruction. Additional guidance will be provided about these courses by March 20, and no in-person laboratory or studio courses will meet prior to April 6.

Students who have already left campus housing or plan to do so should remain at their permanent residence through the spring quarter, if possible. Students who intend to remain in campus housing for the spring quarter are strongly encouraged to remain on campus and not travel over spring break. Student housing, dining, health services, the library, and research support operations will remain open, although there will be changes in most operations and services. 

Should you wish to cancel your housing for the entire spring quarter, you can complete the online Intent to Vacate form. (A link to the form will be emailed to residential students soon). If you remove all of your belongings from your housing and return your key by April 5, you will be eligible for a full refund of any housing and dining fees paid for spring quarter. For any student moving out after April 5, charges will be prorated based on the date the room is vacated and the checkout process is completed. Students cancelling and moving out will not be assessed the standard cancellation fee.

New details about this virus are emerging constantly, and we are updating our campus COVD-19 website regularly. The site includes sections on Health Services, Instruction, Campus Operations, Telecommuting, Events, Student Services, Travel, and International Studies. Please use the site as a resource about the virus and how to protect yourself against it. It is also where you will find all of the latest information on how our campus is responding to the outbreak. The UC Office of the President’s COVID-19 webpage is also a good resource.

I know the measures we have taken are difficult, especially for students. I regret that this period in your lives is being filled with so much uncertainty. Our highest priority must be to keep everyone on our campus safe.

To our faculty and staff, I thank you for your flexibility and willingness to roll up your sleeves as we do our best for our students. You are doing extremely valuable work while undoubtedly also experiencing your own anxiety. Though we do not yet have a confirmed case of COVID-19 on our campus, there are currently seven confirmed cases in the county, and it was announced last night that all Santa Cruz County public schools will shut down next week, March 16-20. I understand the stress this puts on many of you. 

At the same time, I am confident that together we will reach the other side of this upheaval, and I look forward to the time when our community will again be able to come together in person. The preventative measures being taken by universities, by cities and counties, and by the business community are critical to successfully confronting this health emergency. Our best course of action is to undertake aggressive public measures to slow the spread of the virus. The steps we are taking at UCSC are intended to do just that.",0.1464123658459596,0.455331105526418,ucsc

You're all so kind, thank you for everything, the last 6 months were the best 6 months of my life, thank you.

Amazon will come out of this OK; other places, maybe not so much (see, also, [DNA Lounge/Pizza](https://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2020/03/12.html) in SF, etc.).

&amp;#x200B;

* Check to see if a local store has a website or will take phone orders to ship items. Bookshop is now offering $.99 shipping of any books to a Santa Cruz County zip code with orders at [www.bookshopsantacruz.com](https://www.bookshopsantacruz.com) or on the phone (831-423-0900).
* Buy a gift card to your favorite restaurant or store to use when you can go out again.
* If you’ve bought a ticket to a canceled arts performance, think about letting the arts organization keep your money as a donation.
* Send a care package from a local business to someone in quarantine, working in the health care system, or just needs a pick-me-up at this time. ([Pacific Cookie Company cookie packages](https://www.pacificcookie.com/categories/Send_Cookies_as_a_Gift.aspx) are always my go to option).
* If you don’t want to be around too many other people, check to see if your favorite store has early morning or late night hours and shop when there are fewer customers in the store. (Bookshop is open until 10:00pm Sunday-Thursday, and until 11:00pm on Friday and Saturday.)
* Order food from local restaurants for delivery or ask if you can still come in but space chairs farther apart.
* Still buy that birthday present for the party that was cancelled, buy entertainment items for all that time at home (great time to cook and play games) and read. As Ibram X. Kendi just said, “As we practice social distancing, let’s not distance ourselves from books.

1494,Just some perspective for y’all,1,2020-03-14 08:47:38,37,"Hey undergrads, just figured I’d share with you my college experience:

I didn’t go to UCSC, I went to UCSD.  I graduated more than 8 years ago.  Just want to share some of the struggles we faced then, just to give you some perspective. I am now an employee at UCSC, and I love this school. 

My freshman year, we had wild fires that got very close to campus.  School was cancelled for a week due to the smoke in the air.  Class was cancelled, but we were still responsible for the info taught during that week.  Lots of us failed gen chem 1 and had to retake due to this.

My freshman year, some random person pulled into our dorm parking lot blasting music, late at night, the blew their brains out.  Many of saw, heard, or were affected by this.

My sophomore year, the 2008 recession was in full swing. I couldn’t get into a lab class until 2 years later. Less and less classes were offered.  I never got to take zoology, coral reef biology, and a few other upper div. classes I was really looking forward to.  

My out of state tuition went up about 30% in my 4 years.  Still couldn’t take those cool classes or get into ones I needed.

As an out of state student, none of honors classes counted towards my standing.  As a senior, in state sophomores were registering for classes before me.

My junior and senior year, grad students killed themselves in my work building.  This shut down the building for some time.  

The cartel violence began getting out of hand as well around 2008.  Being so close to Mexico and with trips happening to TJ, it made for some stressful times at the university.

Each year, for some reason, we got pro-life protestors on campus for a week who would put up huge photos of dead fetuses in the middle of campus.

I had to threaten the university with legal action because I couldn’t register for a lab class that I needed to graduate and they wanted me to stay another quarter with no guarantee of me being able to get into that course.  My requirement was finally waved and I was allowed to graduate.  

My point in all of this is that you will face adversity.  It’s called real life.  We don’t have control of most things, but we can control our reactions to things.  We all have a story and a struggle.  Keep your chins up, focus on your goals, and keep up the hard work.",0.054513888888888896,0.3707465277777777,ucsc

""To whom it may concern,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm writing to talk to you about the  school's response to the COVID-19. While I agree that social  distancing  and online classes are necessary to reduce the spread of the  virus, I  think given the situation there should be a further change.  Many  students are either gravely concerned for loved ones or otherwise  not in  a proper mentality to focus on schoolwork. Therefore, it is not  an  attempt to shirk our work or get an easy A, rather, this is an  unprecedented situation for most of the student body. We have never  experienced anything like this before, and are no longer on solid  ground. Given these factors, I think forcing students to take final  exams would be detrimental to their health and academic standing. Other universities have taken this into consideration and made their finals optional. I hope you understand why I feel this way, and can take the necessary steps to address this issue. Thank you very much for your time.""",0.16676470588235293,0.5785294117647058,ucsc

It is hard to focus on school when our families are sick, uprooted, and dealing with deep uncertainties regarding fundamental and basic needs. To judge us on our intellectual abilities at a time like this is cruel.

1643,Coronavirus - Email ( Finals ),1,2020-03-15 17:20:11,15,"The following is the email I sent to admin about Finals week. Please feel free to take inspiration and add points of your own about how it’s a national emergency and show your voice to everyone: 

chancellor@ucsc.edu
cpevc@ucsc.edu
rhoads@ucsc.edu
pco@ucsc.edu 

**************************************************
The reason for this email is a request that finals be made optional for this quarter because of how the mood and climate is in each and everyone households around the nation. I understand that this might be a request too difficult to ask for but from the recent events at Stanford, ( the first school to shift over instruction to online) also cancelled finals due to the difficulties many of the faculty and students are facing in this trying time. There have been talks of a national lockdown and many public gathering areas (libraries) are closing down. I as a student has been studying and preparing for my finals but I will be honest to say that it has not been the same as I did for my Fall quarter because of the intense and heavy issues going on outside. I know for sure many of my peers feel the same about this issue. I understand this might not be a health concern but it is detrimental to one’s academic standing and I feel that the university helps the students out during this tough time. There are options such as weighing the midterm score as a final or taking out the final from consideration for this quarter. The students who have the resources and availability to take the finals can do so to test their comprehension of the subject. 
The whole nation is in panic and many events are causing havoc. This is an unprecedented situation and having students stress over final exams would be detrimental to their mental and physical health. We are trying our best as students to focus on our education and UCSC and UC Regents have been a great help so far by listening to our concerns and moving instruction to online. I hope that the UC’s and UCSC can listen to our concerns again and make finals optional. 
Hopefully by the middle of Spring Quarter, Coronavirus would have hit its Iffection point and events can go back to regular. 
Thank you for your support during this very rough patch of the year. 
I hope you take my request into consideration.

Make sure you do a walk-through before you leave and have the property in the condition that it was given to you in or in the condition that you agreed to with the landlord or the property management. Turn in all your keys, and I mean all keys. Expect either your deposit or an itemized list of how your deposit was spent or partial deposit was spent including receipts, the names and contact numbers for the people that did the work on the property and dates that the work was performed so that goes without saying make sure you leave a forwarding address!

Look at the mortality rate in Italy -- this is a result of overburdening the healthcare system. If you want to be careless and get sick, fine, you have a 5-20% chance to enter critical condition and require hospitalization. Since you are young, you will have high priority and likely get treatment. However, they will be kicking a grandmother off her ventilator to do that for you.

People who enter that critical stage will die if they don't get medical attention. It does not matter how old you are.",-0.0867936507936508,0.6536190476190477,ucsc
1732,Free Focusmate Account for UCSC Students during Pandemic,2,2020-03-16 15:03:56,2,"In light of the Covid19 pandemic Focusmate, a **virtual coworking and accountability service**, has agreed to give UC Santa Cruz affiliates unlimited sessions free of charge (normally it's $5 a month, but I asked the founder to do us a favor). Sign up using your UCSC Email or use this link: [www.focusmate.com/signup/UCSantaCruz](http://www.focusmate.com/signup/UCSantaCruz)   


Please share this with your classmates, friends, &amp; teachers! 

  
**How it works:**   
First you commit to a 50 minute time slot, and you are matched with a focusmate. When the time comes you show up on time, briefly check in with your partner **over video chat**, leave your video on while you work quietly in tandem, and then briefly check in at the end to see how the session went.   
**Why Use it**   
I personally find focusmate useful for studying year round, but I think it will be critical for doing well on online courses next quarter.  

* Get the social accountability of a study buddy while maintaining safe distances 
* Keep a schedule and maintain momentum in these Weird Times
* Hold yourself accountable to study at specific times 
* Use social pressure to get up in the morning 
* Have the option to match with UCSC affiliates by only selecting ""University California Santa Cruz"" under groups. (though this will only be useful if enough of us sign up for time slots) 

**Focusmate** **Community Standards**  
Here are the guidelines that Focusmate has for their sessions. I will...  


* Spend 10-30 seconds describing the tasks I’ll work on during the session
* Ask if my partner prefers my mic muted or unmuted
* Work on the tasks I’ve declared, updating my partner via text chat as I go
* Check in verbally with my partner at the end to discuss how it went, and celebrate!

I won't... 

* Start a conversation during the session
* Socialize with others around me
* Get up and disappear without letting my partner know why and for how long
* Leave early, or without checking in verbally with my partner
* Take screenshots or recordings of my session

If this sounds like it'd be something useful, Go to[ this link ](https://www.focusmate.com/signup/UCSantaCruz)or sign up with your UCSC email!!

1809,Next Quarter could have great impact on future online course offerings.,1,2020-03-17 09:22:26,44,"**TLDR;** Don't slack off next quarter. This will increase the odds that schools/employers will begin offering more remote/online options in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

Wouldn't it be nice if more classes were offered online? If more courses had the option of webcast and online assignments. Who thinks they could effectively complete most of their courses if they were offered in an online format? \~50% of what I have learned from my CS Degree I have learned myself online and another \~25% I learned from reading at home and showing up when required.

Some people can not afford to go to school because they are single parents, or older siblings with single parents, or need to work full time, etc. We live in a day and age where remote schooling (and even office work) should be much more widely available. It would open doors for so many people; where they can live, what they can do with their lives, the list goes on.

The next quarter could determine a great deal about how universities (and employers) offer course work in the future. If employees and students are more productive and successful when working from the comfort of their own homes during a time of day that best suits their schedule, it is much more likely that this will become a more widely available option in the future. If they have not yet set up a system for monitoring student/instructor responses to next quarters remote classes and collecting data for comparison someone should.

SO...don't mess it up. Let's put our best foot forward next quarter.",0.2894871332371332,0.4100529100529101,ucsc

I’ve done some research and I think I’m choosing between a few (Merrill, Crown, 9/10, Rachel Carson) but it’ll be helpful to have a student’s perspective. 

Here are some things I want to consider:?
Things I really want: 
- No big party scene
- Preferably substance free 
- Focus on academics 
- Relatively easy to make friends/socialize 
- Overall relaxed and chill vibes 
- Single gender floors

Bonus things:
- near a library/ somewhere to study
- Near dining hall that closes late
- I’m Christian so maybe a college with somewhat of a Christian population

More things about me: I’m a hispanic female going in as a computer engineering major. I want to be able to hang out with non STEM people as well to diversify my friend group. I don’t have too big of a preference on college location- I enjoy walking a lot, hills are fine. 

Also, what’s the cheapest housing situation and where? (I don’t want apartment style housing since I assume it’ll be more expensive) I was thinking about a triple but after some research I found out they have 4-5 people dorms... is this a good idea or am I better off in a triple?

GUTHAUS LITERALLY EATS UNDERGRAD SOULS FOR SUSTENANCE... (jk nah I get that he's trying to be a good professor but like... unless...)

I'm a CS Major transfer, whose CSE101 transfer credit equivalency got denied cause apparently you cant transfer upper divs especially CSE101... but continuing on; CSE101 with professor Seshadri (forgive me for incorrect spelling) made the course really interactive and I loved it. The way that the course was structured was to help us be prepared for real world coding problems. The prof is a literal meme within the class with how relatable he is to our situation. Great Professor 101/101 would take again.

CSE12 on the other hand straight up is just a workhorse class that was much harder than it needed to be. In my opinion, we are at a technology stand point where implementing assembly code is not necessarily needed but a handy skill to have (I AGREE), but THERE IS NO NEED TO USE AN ACTUAL ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE THAT CAUSES SO MANY PROBLEMS AS MAJORITY OF THE PPL TAKING THE CLASS COME FROM A CONVENTIONAL CODING STATNDPOINT LIKE PYTHON, JAVA, OR C/C++.

AND THE FINAL!!!!!! PROF GUTHAUS LITTERALLY SAID THAT THE FINAL WAS OPTIONAL BUT APPARENTLY TO HIM THE WORD OPTIONAL IS EITHER TAKE THE INCOMPLETE GRADE STATUS OR PASS THE CLASS... NONONO OPTIONAL MEANS THAT THE FINAL IS A GRADE BOOSTER!!! AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT THE FINAL IS SO DUMB IN TERMS OF THE TIMING AND NUMBER OF QUESTIONS. I'D RATHER HAVE A FEW HARD QUESTIONS IN REASONABLE TIME LIMIT THAN 47 HARD QUESTIONS IN A 100 MINUTE TIME LIMIT IN WHICH EACH QUESTION MAY TAKE 5-10 MINUTES TO COMPREHEND AND COMPUTE!!!!!!!!!

ALSO WHAT IN THE ACTUAL REEEEEEEE IS HIS THOUGHT PROCESS OF NOT LETTING US CHECK OUR ANSWERS!!!!! WE ARE UNDERGRADS LEARNING THIS STUFF NOT GRADS OR POST-GRADS WHOVE MASTERED IT!!!!!!!!!!!

CTION REQUIRED by March 20: Undergraduate, Graduate and Family Student Housing Tenants

Students departing Housing - Complete the [Intent to Vacate](https://forms.gle/rrUd25b7DVb9oy5P8) form
Students remaining in Housing - Complete the [Remain in Residence](https://forms.gle/UABzW2jhpec143wB6) form
Additionally, students who have already returned to their permanent residence and need to request an extension to remove their belongings at a later date should ALSO complete the [Late Checkout](https://forms.gle/rQT4rM6gsQiDYRDJ7) form.


More detail below:

Students Moving Out of University Housing
Whether you have already left campus or are planning to soon, please complete the Intent to Vacate form by Friday, March 20. If you have already completed this form then you do not need to complete it again.

Students who complete their move-out and/or have submitted their Intent to Vacate notice by Friday, March 20 will be eligible for a full refund of any housing and dining fees for spring quarter. This will also apply to students who need to request a Late Checkout because they are unable to retrieve their belongings and complete the move-out process at this time.

We will process cancellations and make adjustments to student accounts in the order in which move-out process has been completed. We appreciate your patience during this time and advise that you closely monitor your university account (my.ucsc.edu) to see when your charges have been adjusted. Your account will not accrue a housing late fee while we work to process your adjustment.

Additionally, we will not be voiding guarantees for students who cancel their university housing for spring 2020. Therefore, if a student has a guarantee that extends beyond spring 2020, they will retain that guarantee as long as they apply during the April 13-20 Priority Housing Application Period.

Students Remaining in University Housing
If you need to remain in university housing through spring, please indicate that by completing the Remain in Residence form by Friday, March 20.

Students may consider remaining on campus during the Spring Quarter only if they satisfy at least one of the following conditions:

Do not have access to alternate housing
Financial resources do not enable a return to their permanent residence
Personal health or safety considerations prohibit relocation
Permanent residence does not have, and cannot obtain the infrastructure needed to support remote learning
Other extenuating circumstances
As a university, we understand the challenges faced in following public health guidelines to limit close contact with others to slow the spread of coronavirus. Your health and safety are our first priority, and we are taking actions to significantly increase social distancing on our campus.

*It is likely we will need to close some of the residential buildings and relocate those students remaining on campus into fewer locations, as well as adjust our housing and dining operations to improve social distancing. These decisions will be made once we have determined how many students have a need to remain in university housing.*

Thank you for your patience and flexibility as we work to keep students and the UCSC community healthy and safe.",0.05462962962962963,0.39537037037037037,ucsc

1875,This has been my worst quarter here,1,2020-03-17 21:44:36,10,"This is my fourth year at UCSC. As a first generation student coming from the city the culture shock and adjustment to this environment was a very rough transition. Especially being in a field such as computer engineering. I’ve failed classes and struggled through my first two years just to barely make it to declaration. I’ve worked on campus, I’ve tried the clubs, I’ve talked to classmates, made friends, and even took a visit to caps once to try and assimilate but to no avail. I’ve tried so hard. I’ve struggled but persevered all this time. But this last quarter has just been the absolute worst. Not because I feel like I might fail a class. I’ve done that before and I don’t mind retaking a class if that’s what it takes to get my degree. But this quarter is not one of those situation. Everything that has hindered my ability to try and be the best student I can be this quarter has been out of my control. All these frustrating events that have taken place this quarter have shown me how truly powerless I am at this institution, and how much my presence is valued. I’m not the type to give up but I fear if I have another quarter like this one I might have no choice but to do so. I don’t know how to feel anymore. The advice people have been offering is to “struggle on”, but is that really ok? Is it ok for us to struggle like this? I feel so powerless and pathetic. This has been the most frustrating quarter ever. It’s like I’m invisible. I just feel so defeated

Don’t really know the point of this post tbh haha. Guess I just needed to rant. Maybe my story will give someone else comfort and make them feel a little less alone. If you feel like I do, I believe in you, don’t give up, I’m rooting for you :)",-0.04916666666666666,0.5055747126436781,ucsc

I have worked so hard for the first three years so I can have the perfect finale. I planned and saved all of my favorite classes for last and now they are online.

I know this is selfish on my end and I shouldn't be putting blame on the spring quarter situation. But I am beyond disappointed with the result. I needed the time to prepare myself for what was to come in the future.

Hearing that I not only have to justify staying here, the only housing I have available to me right now, but that I may also have to move to another dorm god knows where at the drop of a hat. 

I've been managing alright up until now, I live in a single and I've had no trouble avoiding others. I have a susceptibility to respiratory illness so I've been extra careful. I've been trying so hard to keep up with school and stay positive through all this but I'm so anxious and scared right now.

I don't know when I'll see my family again. I have no way of traveling to visit them and moving back to live with them is simply not an option. They moved to a one bedroom to support my college career, they barely have enough room for themselves let alone me. My dad works at a hospital as a psychiatrist, he's a little older and has bad lungs like me. I'm worried about him every single day. 

I have no money, no car, and no support here in Santa Cruz, I'm completely alone and starting to really panic. I'm terrified of being kicked out of my dorm and left alone to move across campus, I'm scared of getting sick, I'm scared of losing family, and I'm scared about my God damn grades on top of it all.

See, I have a job on campus. Typically it takes a ten minute walk to get to work from my current housing. It wouldn't be too much of an issue if I move out, as I have family in the area. But the place I would be staying typically takes two bus rides to get to UCSC, and roughly an hour total to arrive. I have few other forms of transportation at the time being. Additionally, I have issues with focus, mental health, and sleep, so it taking ten minutes to walk versus fretting over bus schedules is probably better. My concern is that if I move out, it'll have an adverse effect on my ability to work, as getting to and from would be more challenging.

If you’ve taken this professor’s class before, you’ll know who I’m talking about. This professor made all of his students download an app called RescueTime that tracks your online data, and tracks your phone location at all times (this assignment was for about 10% of our final project grade). 

He then told us to make our Instagram accounts public and give him the name so that he could take screenshots and have other students make inferences about us (about 6% of our total grade). 

For a final whammy, he made it necessary for us to upload our RescueTime data with our final project to receive the full grade. The RescueTime data is uneditable, and shows a full list of all the websites and applications that we have visited in the last month. 

My question is, how is this legal, and is there anything I can do about this? I don’t understand how my classmates and I are essentially being forced into releasing our private information in exchange for our passing grades.",-0.0015625000000000049,0.5661458333333332,ucsc

With Covid-19 I hope everyone is staying safe and practicing social distancing. As it would be inconsiderate to put others at risk by hosting backpacking trips we will **not** be hosting any trips next quarter. That being said we've created a UCSC backpacking Strava club.

We'll be doing virtual group runs and hikes from now on.

1977,On dealing with mental health and online courses,1,2020-03-18 22:45:35,3,"I definitely feel like this virus and self isolation has taken a toll on our mental health, and leaves a lot of grey area on how to tackle online courses for the first time. After a lot of thinking I stumbled across some useful information on how to avoid worsening mental health symptoms (by a psychologist named Dr. Amber Thornton) as well as how to prepare for online learning (by Dr. Kate Symons, a coordinate for online learning). Hope this is useful to many and hoping we can all uplift each other during sad times :-) 

How to avoid worsening mental health symptoms during social distancing: 

1. Continue to socialize from afar.
While we may not be able to have as many in person gatherings, don’t forget about the other ways to be social.
Call or text your family and friends.
Video chat and FaceTime! 
A perfect time to reach out to that person you have been missing.

2. Take social media breaks!
While social media can help with the socializing piece, TAKE MULTIPLE BREAKS within your day. This will help avoid the fear and anxiety about  coronavirus. 
It’s good to stay informed but we don’t want to become inundated

3. Make and keep a set routine.
Structure and routine are healthy and also helps to ward off worsening depressive/anxious symptoms. 
Take some time to organize and plan your days, so that you will find a good rhythm and routine that feels good for you.

4. Practice healthy self-talk.
Yes, it’s OKAY to talk to yourself and this is an important time to ensure you are keeping your thoughts and self-talk HEALTHY! 
Remind yourself of what’s going well in life, remind yourself what is happening now isn’t forever, etc.

5. Don’t neglect your basic self-care.
Staying indoors can make us forget the basics. So...
Good hygiene everyday!
Drink all your water.
Eat consistently.
Take a few walks/exercise.
SLEEP.
Generally, take extra care of your body

+ Preparing for Online Learning

1. Be patient: Your lecturers have been asked to make their teaching available to you online at the last minute. The best online learning takes time to develop. Please be patient with them if things don't go right for you the first time.

2. Embrace online: Online learning will become more and more common in the future, so this is a great chance for you to develop some skills to help you succeed.

3. Develop your communication skills: You will communicate in different ways on various online formats (email, discussion boards, social media, online seminars). Be professional and appropriate, but don't be afraid to project your personality and show that you are a real person.

4. What if I have a technical issue? Develop your initiative and resilience. Don’t give up if you hit a technical issue. For example, if your reading link is broken, maybe you can search for the journal article yourself by using the library search.

5. Stick to a routine: There are many time management techniques, so find one which works for you. There will likely be daily and weekly tasks for you to do plus longer term targets like deadlines. Plan a daily, weekly and monthly schedule to manage these different timescales.

6. Get connected: Be proactive with communicating with your course mates. Set up course Whatsapp groups (or another platform if you prefer) for offline chatting and engagement. Form small virtual study or reading groups and work through online materials together.

7. Find somewhere quiet to work. Yes you can work from bed but this might not be the most comfortable! Make sure you have somewhere peaceful to work, try and use a workspace like a desk or table, and cut down on external and online distractions.

8. Use the right channels to solve your problems: This will be signposted for you in your course, so contacting the correct person will help you get your problem solved more quickly.

9. Embrace discussion boards: If your course has them, these are a great way to discuss with your peers and work through learning as a group. Ask questions, comment on your course mates' answers, and enter into dialogue.

10: Online learning communities can be as rich, supportive and exciting as on campus learning. I hope you can adapt to this experience and benefit from it.

One last one - depending on your field, you might find collective and open access syllabi. @PolEcoNet has open access learning available:

2015,Walked out of ProctorU exam. What now?,1,2020-03-19 13:32:58,16,"So I had a ProctorU test this morning I was supposed to take. I was completely unprepared for it, both in terms of content and in terms of getting the proctoring to work. It's been a rough quarter and a rough year. Everything put together I have been completely unable to focus on schoolwork and being stuck in my room for the past week or so hasn't really help. I'm sure many of you can relate right now.

I scrambled to get all the pieces together at the last 20 minutes until I actually started the exam and realised what the proctoring actually involved. I have anxiety and I'm deeply protective over what's on my computer. I also didnt have time to wake up or have breakfast or clean anything up on my desktop. The idea of some complete stranger having control over my desktop and watching me near have a panic attack over a test I didnt study for was way to much to handle. I know that this is the proctors job and that they probably dont care but that's not how my anxiety works. I closed out of the application before the test proper had started and I haven't looked back.

I dont think I'll manage to get a passing grade for any of the classes I took this quarter. I had two graded classes and one pass/no pass that I'll almost certainly fail at this point. I only have one easy 2 credit class that I definitely passed. Does anyone know what happens now? Will I be on academic probation? I dont want to go back and try to take the test again. ProctorU is terrifying and it will take a good long while before I find a way to trust it. Does anyone know?

I feel like if the tests were proctored by the actual teachers or TAs I'd be a lot more comfortable but given that they're proctored by strangers I have no relationship with and that it feels like a one on one session, it feels incredibly claustrophobic. I dont know if anyone has similar feelings I just cant take tests that way.

It’s not technically a class, it’s an internship I’m doing as my senior exit for environmental studies. The only downside I see is that I’d have to do a capstone in the summer instead, and I wouldn’t qualify for departmental highest honors, which I’m starting to not care too much about. Also, I’d probably have to repay a scholarship that I received for my internship. 

I’ve been immensely overwhelmed this quarter and I’m considering ending my internship now (envs senior internships are 2 quarter commitments, I started in winter), which I think would result in a no pass. I also have only completed 40% of three hours I was meant to, so I’d at least have to take an incomplete, but I cannot handle more work to remove the incomplete on top of my regular hours, my other internship, classes, and now I’m starting eating disorder treatment which will add 15 hrs a week.

It would cost you 6k to live off campus for 12 months as opposed to 19.5k on campus(if you stay in the summer) and you dont have the hassle of being kicked out every vacation.

My name is James, and I have some questions about UCSC. But first, let me introduce myself. I'm a high school senior who lives in Boston Massachusetts. And I was recently accepted to UCSC for computer science. I love going on adventures with friends, cooking, painting, programming, and listening to music. My plan was to come visit if I got accepted to see if I like the campus...but then coronavirus happened so that idea is kinda out the window at this point. You might be asking why would I come all the way from Boston to go to school in California. Sometimes I find myself asking the same question, there are some amazing schools out here on the East, but I'm looking to start a new chapter in life. I'm looking to use my college experience to adventure, grow as a person, and challenge myself. And I wanted to find out if UCSC would be the place for me to accomplish that.

Given that I can no longer travel to the school, could you guys give me some insight into what life at UCSC is like? I really value any information you could give, and it would be a major help. Additionally, I understand that things are tough with the unrest and the virus right now, but I'm hoping I can learn the positives the school has to offer. Ok, here's what I'm curious about:

Campus Life:

1. What's your life like at UCSC? What's a regular day on campus look like?
2. What are the people like at UCSC? Is it easy to make friends?
3. What do you enjoy doing on campus and in Santa Cruz for fun?
4. Is there good coffee on campus? (I'm a coffee lover)
5. What is housing like on-campus/off-campus
6. How is the weather in Santa Cruz?
7. What's the town like? Any good food around?
8. Can I have a car on campus?
9. What's your favorite thing about UCSC?
10. Are there a good amount of clubs, and is there a gym?

Academics:

1. How do you like taking classes at UCSC?
2. What size are the classes?
3. Is it easy to get extra help / how hard are classes?
4. I hear the CS major is impacted and people have a hard time getting classes. CS majors, how is your experience?
5. How is the business program? Alongside computers, I'm also interested in business.

Final Question:

1. Despite the issues I see on this subreddit, do you enjoy UC Santa Cruz? Do you think you made the right choice?

Any information would really help me out!

So my question is for each major listed above that I am interested in (Computer Science: Computer Game Design, Computer Science, and Marine Biology), what courses do I need, how difficult are classes, what does a typical day look like for these majors, what jobs accept people with the degrees in these majors, will I have time for myself with these majors, and is there art involved within these majors?",0.04823717948717947,0.5297435897435897,ucsc

**Please fill out** [**this form**](https://forms.gle/beTCCKmxzmPHehN96) **if you're interested** in joining UCSC's new NeuroTech club which will start having General Body Meetings next Fall. We'll be spending Fall teaching concepts in NeuroTech such as hardware tools like EEG and data analysis algorithms like CSP, and then next Winter **building a project** to submit to NeuroTechX's **global competition**. For more information, check out [NeuroTechX](https://neurotechx.com/), which is the organization we'll be a chapter of. They're growing quite quickly and Berkeley, UCLA, UCSD, UC Davis, and USC have all had their clubs founded in just the past couple years.

We know Fall 2020 might seem like a while away, but it would be great if we could gauge your general interest right now, as we'll be in the process of developing curriculum and planning next year's logistics throughout Spring Quarter this year. **If you want to be part of that process (as an officer)**, please let us know in [the form](https://forms.gle/beTCCKmxzmPHehN96) as well!

This quarter is my second time. I did pretty well on the labs and assignments, but I failed the final. In fact, I actually learned and understand way more than I did the first time.

The sudden change from physical to online finals and the coronavirus worries affected me hard. The final was nothing like the practice final. Not only was it much harder we also had less time. It went from a 3 hour final to a 2 hour final. There was a curve but it didn't save me. The scores showed that it was hard for everyone. Before the curve, the average was less than 50 and the highest was around 80. I also was unable to study because of the coronavirus worries and other class worries. All I could think of was coronavirus or grades. After a few minutes of studying my mind would drift back to worrying. I couldn't help myself.

I'm not blaming the professor or anyone since none of this is anyone's fault. Well, actually I'm the one to blame.

I'm suppose to graduate next quarter as a computer science bs major. Because I failed CSE 130 twice which means I would need to ask for a double repeat and I've heard they are pretty strict about it. Also this would mean I would need to stay another quarter assuming I get the chance to repeat another time. Assuming everything else goes smoothly next quarter, the only remaining class I need to graduate with a BS is 130.

Now what I want is some advice on whether I should stay another quarter assuming I get to repeat again or should I just graduate next quarter with a CS BA.",-0.05899122807017544,0.43259711779448623,ucsc

The site is based off of a 2011-era version of the game, and features all of the games/items from then. I'm also working to customize the content a bit, but modifying the source is more difficult than it seems.

When you connect, it will ask you to enable Flash Player. On Chrome, click the little ""(i)"" to the left of the URL, change the option for ""Flash"" to ""Allow"", and refresh the page. Also, when you make an account, it will say you need to verify your email. I turned that off for now, so you can just login right away. Pretty much everything is working, but if you try to load a room/game and it shows the waiting screen indefinitely, it likely means I haven't yet been able to recover the files for that.

Moreover, this will certainly be more engaging than beamer slides (or pre-recorded lectures). If the tablet linked above is too expensive, then there are cheaper alternatives available on Amazon (such as those by Huion and XP-Pen).

Please **be mindful about the size of the tablet relative to your computer screen's resolution**, because the sensitivity (and ability to legibly write small letters) will depend on this ratio.

2389,Emergency notification: Confirmed case of COVID-19 at UCSC,1,2020-03-27 14:29:12,17,"March 27, 2020


To: UC Santa Cruz Community

From: Chancellor Cynthia Larive 

           Vice Chancellor for Business and Administrative Services Sarah Latham

Subject: Emergency notification: Confirmed case of COVID-19 at UCSC	


We write to share that the Santa Cruz County Health Services Agency confirmed today that a student member of the UC Santa Cruz community has tested positive for COVID-19. The student lives off campus and has been self-isolating since being tested. The student was last on campus March 16 and is doing well. 


We are coordinating closely with local public health officials and following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and California Department of Public Health (CDPH) guidance in responding to this case. Student Health Services and Office of Emergency Services personnel are working with public health officials to determine whether there are members of the campus community who may have had significant exposure to this individual and who may subsequently have an increased risk of developing COVID-19. Public health officials will determine specific actions that may be needed, such as self-quarantine. 


The health and well-being of our campus community is our top priority. The campus is ensuring that this student is getting the care and support that they need. Student Health Services and Office of Emergency Services personnel continue to proactively identify individuals with potential COVID-19 exposure and request that they self-quarantine to protect our community. 


Students, faculty, and staff should stay home and call their healthcare provider if they have symptoms of respiratory illness, especially fever and cough. The CDC’s coronavirus self-checker is a good tool to help you determine what next steps should be taken. 

What students should do

Students, whether on campus, off campus in Santa Cruz, or at their permanent residence, can call the Student Health Center at 831-459-2591 for instructions on self-care or to make a telehealth or in-person appointment. Information about after-hours care for students is available online. Acutely ill students who are not in Santa Cruz should seek medical care from a healthcare provider in their area.


If you are a student who received care off-campus and have tested positive, or if you have been exposed to someone who has tested positive, please notify the Student Health Center at 831-459-2591 so that we can help coordinate your care and support the health of our campus community.

What employees should do

Employees should seek medical care through their regular healthcare providers. If you have tested positive for COVID-19, or were exposed to someone who tested positive, please email your supervisor and the Office of Emergency Services (Lisa Ehret, director) at oes@ucsc.edu.

Where you can find updates and additional information

The COVID-19 situation is dynamic, which means guidance from public health officials and the CDC changes frequently. The COVID-19 campus website is being updated regularly with the latest information, including the number of confirmed cases in Santa Cruz County and our campus community. Notification about additional confirmed cases of COVID-19 within our campus community will be based on guidance from public health officials.


We appreciate everyone’s cooperation and patience during this challenging time. 

Steps to stay healthy 

The CDC provides the following guidance on how to protect yourself: 

Clean your hands often:

Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.

If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. 

Avoid close contact with others:

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

Put distance between yourself and other people (at least 6 feet).

Take steps to protect others:

Stay home, except for essential business/services as covered in the state’s stay-at-home order.

Cover coughs and sneezes:

Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow.

Throw used tissues in the trash.

Immediately clean your hands.

Wear a facemask if you are sick and around other people.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces. ",0.07165764790764788,0.4388122988122987,ucsc

BME 110 and BME 130 were just added to class search yesterday, as was the expansion of BME 163.

BME 110 and BME 130 are suitable for anyone in the life sciences who has had a genetics course (BME 110 will accept a biochem course as prereq instead).

BME 163 has BME 160 as a prereq, but students with strong Python programming experience can probably convince Chris Vollmers to give them a permission code to add.  BME 163 is changing from being a 5-unit course to being a 3-unit course, but I don't know whether that will take effect with this offering of BME 163 or the next one (the change was just approved by CCI, so could take effect immediately).

The capacity for BME 160 (Research programming in the life sciences) was also increased, but the increase was swallowed up almost immediately and there is again a waitlist.  Too bad, because that course is the solidest intro to Python on campus (much faster paced than CSE 20).

I'm a potential freshman deciding between Santa Cruz and a couple of other UCs. I've been in therapy for about a year and am likely to be in therapy when I'm in college as well. 

I'm curious about the therapy situation at Santa Cruz. I know there are psychiatrists on-campus who can prescribe medication and that you can see on-campus psychologists for a few weeks. How hard is it to make the switch from on-campus therapists to therapists in the community? What's the quality of on-campus therapists like?

2424,Don’t 👏come 👏here 👏undecided 👏,1,2020-03-27 23:43:30,34,"This is a PSA for all rising freshmen thinking about attending ANY UC without having a goal in mind. I would recommend that you don’t. Go to a community college first. 

You’ve definitely heard the price angle, so I won’t go into that (though please look at the prices dear lord), but I want to talk about the quality of education. 

UCs are really great for networking with professors and grad students, we have some amazing thinkers and researchers on campus. It’s where you can do real research and work in your academic field. That’s why people should come here. 

If you don’t know your academic field yet, you won’t benefit from all those things. 

I’m a cog sci major, education minor, I went to community college for 4 years and I’m set to graduate this spring with a 3.9 gpa. 

I didn’t have a single class in CC that had more than 30-40 people. You know what that means? One on one attention from your professors all the dang time. My professors knew my name and actually graded and gave intense feedback to all of my papers, and were really able to push me as an individual. All of my hardest and best classes were at CC. For so cheap I could pay for them myself working part time at Panera.


At CC I was able to study abroad in Barcelona for a semester- the sticker price was only 10k including tuition.  That’s kind of about price, but also about how there are still great opportunities at community college. 


Also, they never tell you, but when you transfer from a community college your GPA is wiped clean and all your sins are forgiven. You can fail your world literature class in cc because you dropped the class after arguing with your professor for 20 minutes about Joseph Conrad. IT DOESN’T MATTER. In CC My GPA was like, 3.2 cause I was 18 and fucked around (and argued with professors) 

I get good grades now cause I have a goal and a vision and a life plan, ya know? I’m so glad I didn’t come at 18. 


IF you want to go to a UC because you have that plan and vision ABSOLUTELY come. But if you don’t, DON’T.",0.2576940035273369,0.5480599647266314,ucsc

2426,CSE Classes Cancelled Due to Covid-19,1,2020-03-28 00:03:50,3,"I was enrolled in CSE 112 for spring quarter and on track to graduate by this summer, but this class along with CSE 104 and 111 (I believe) have been cancelled. Does anyone know if the administration would consider just waiving some requirements to let people graduate on time? To me this seems easier than having to move even more students into already overcrowded classes that don't have anything to do with the classes we were supposed to take. I could be reaching here, but this solution makes sense to me since CSE 116 isn't being offered this quarter to help those that were supposed to take CSE 112. Also the other two classes that were cancelled, CSE 104 and 111 are not part of the required CS curriculum chart so I'm guessing they are taken primarily as electives. It just seems logical to let students waive those elective requirements and CSE 112 if they were scheduled to take them this quarter.

I haven't gotten any updates on the status of these classes so this is purely speculation and maybe a bit of hopeful thinking on my part. If anyone has any thoughts on this whole situation or how they think it might play out I'd love to hear them.

After I visited, this is my top choice as I love surfing, the campus was amazing, and the computer engineering program seemed awesome. I’m from NJ, so would be paying out of state tuition though, if admitted from the waitlist. 

Speaking of the waitlist, I know the admission rate changes every year, so that’s unpredictable, but if anyone here was accepted off of the waitlist, when did you get your decision back? 


My other options (admitted directly to CE) ranked are:
1.	University of Delaware
2.	Old Dominion 
3.	George Mason 

I liked University of Delaware the best, but would probably attend UC Santa Cruz over it if accepted, would have to look at the financials though.

could you guys help me based on my interests and preferences?

okay, so for starters, i'd prefer a place that:

* is pretty diverse. i'm fil-am and being surrounded by culturally-inclusive people is important to me
* chill party scene. i'd be down for parties but i'm not really crazy about them
* easy to make friends/socialize
* overall friendly and tight community
* concerned about academics but not super duper competitive

&amp;#x200B;

other things that would be sick:

* near the gym
* good or even decent food
* decent dorms. i know this one might be too much to ask bc i know dorms suck in general but i guess i'd like ones that relatively nice/modern

&amp;#x200B;

other things about me:

* going into global econ. i don't mid being a little far from class locations. i like walking, especially in such a beautiful campus like ucsc

2576,Notice of Mandatory Housing Relocation Email,1,2020-03-30 12:32:44,0,"IMPORTANT: If you did not receive this email, you should be not have to worry about being moved.

On to the email:

Dear [Your Name],
In response to COVID-19, UC Santa Cruz has taken steps to dramatically and immediately reduce the number of people living on campus. Students who can return to a permanent address or make alternate housing arrangements have been encouraged to leave campus. However, we understand that leaving campus may not be an option for everyone and we are committed to supporting our students through this outbreak.
In order to focus our staffing and support services on the needs of a smaller residential population on campus, we will be relocating the following residents:

Students living in residence halls

Students living at the Camper Park, Village, or University Town Center

Students living in apartments at Cowell College, Redwood Grove, and the Porter Apartment Buildings F and G

Students will be relocated to College Nine, College Ten, Crown College, or Merrill College. It is our goal to:

Reassign apartment residents to the apartments at one of the above communities.

Reassign residence hall residents to the residence hall facilities at one of the above communities. These housing areas are in proximity to one of the two campus dining halls that we currently plan to keep open (College Nine/College Ten Dining Hall and Crown Dining Hall).

Moving assistance will be provided. This will include moving bins, supplies such as cardboard boxes and tape, as well as movers and trucks to transport your belongings to your new housing assignment.

Housing staff are currently working on your new housing assignment. You will soon receive a message with information about your new room assignment and instructions for completing your move. To be clear, this move is mandatory and we appreciate your cooperation. Note: special attention is being placed on students with disability-related needs to ensure the new housing assignment will meet their individual needs.
In order to maximize efficient use of housing space, while also implementing appropriate physical distancing for residents, each room will be assigned as a single. Students will not be negatively financially impacted by this change to single occupancy residency. Instead all residential students will be charged the triple room rate for spring quarter. Additionally, students on the 5-day meal plan for spring quarter will be upgraded, at no additional cost, to the 7-day plan to ensure dining access during the weekends. Students already on the 7-day plan for spring quarter will receive a rate reduction to the cost of the 5-day plan. Apartment residents who wish to obtain the 7-day meal plan at the 5-day plan cost may do so.
You are receiving this letter because you have indicated that you plan to remain in residence this spring. We want you to know the latest information so that you can make an informed decision about your housing situation to the extent that you have choices. If you can make alternate housing arrangements, we strongly urge you to do so. If you do plan to leave campus, please complete the Intent to Vacate form to indicate your intention to move-out of university housing as soon as possible. We will continue to offer a full housing refund for spring quarter to students who give their intent to vacate and complete their move-out by April 19.
Based upon the current public health information available, the following details the conditions we anticipate in our residential buildings during spring quarter. Please keep in mind that this is an evolving situation and circumstances may change further.

We are doing all we can to prevent the spread of COVID-19. However, the virus has already become so prevalent that public health authorities believe that if testing were more widely available, it would reveal that many of us, including UCSC students and employees, have already been exposed to this virus.

The primary public health strategy is mitigation: reducing exposure by rigorous compliance with physical distancing recommendations, cessation of group gatherings, regular handwashing and extra care to avoid unnecessary contact with our most vulnerable populations. This is most effective when followed by all of us as individuals. However, we want to prepare you for the reality that some people residing in as well as staff supporting campus housing will inevitably become ill with COVID-19.

It is also inevitable that students who become sick with COVID-19 but are not ill enough to require hospitalization will need to self-isolate in campus residences. Students who are exposed to the virus before they realize it will be living in some proximity to students who are well, increasing the potential for the virus to spread.

We will close several of the residential buildings and relocate any students residing there, as well as adjust our housing and dining operations to improve physical distancing.

Any resident who remains on campus for spring should be prepared to be relocated (possibly more than once) so that we may create spaces for isolation as well as quarantine.

Dining Services will be limited to take-out only meals.

We appreciate that this information may add to your anxiety during what is an already stressful time. It is our goal to share as much information as we have as quickly as possible so you can make decisions that are right for you.
Since you are planning to remain in residence during spring, please begin to prepare yourself for relocation, and follow instructions that will follow from your Housing/Student Life Office.

Sincerely,
Student Housing Services",0.10134889265324049,0.432261699653004,ucsc

2631,2020 commencement,1,2020-03-31 01:30:13,9,"Hi everyone. The past two to three weeks has been such a crazy ride and still continues on. 

As a graduating senior, I was beyond devastated to learn that we won't have a commencement at the traditional time. And I understand that this tragedy was beyond anyone's control. I don't even think it is such a huge deal for myself. But I would like to walk for the family and friends that sacrificed so much to allow me to accomplish college. I am sad for my friends who are first generation immigrants who poured out so much to finish this degree. My hearts out to them. Every morning I wake up, I get disappointed about everyone especially the seniors ending their last quarter online and the fact that we won't get to walk. 

But I'm just wondering about other alternatives. I've seen other universities either cancelling, holding a virtual commencement, or postponing it to a later date. I've seen online petitions trying to change the administration's decisions. For graduating seniors, how do you guys feel about alternatives to the commencement? I wonder whether people, especially those who live far away, would actually come back for a later commencement. Or whether it would be better to just let it be. If many people feel for one way, I am hoping a petition can help our voices be heard to the administration. 

Ultimately, I would like everyone to know that their feelings are valid. My disappointment was valid. For me personally, it's difficult to focus on online courses and doing work when I know about everything going on around the world... when I can't see the end goal of walking. It is not wrong to feel sad for this while the world is going through this time. While I'm deeply troubled by the coronavirus situation and I understand the immense gravity of it, it is also okay for me to feel sad about my senior year being cut short. I hope that everyone will be gentle with yourselves during this difficult period. Stay safe, slugs! : )

My name is Teddy Kurkoski, and I am an Admissions Director for the 2020 Out for Undergrad (O4U) Engineering Conference, which is a weekend-long professional development conference for high achieving, high potential LGBTQ+ undergraduate students who are studying engineering or interested in going into engineering. If you're not familiar with Out for Undergrad (O4U) or the O4U Engineering Conference, you can learn more about it on the website here: https://www.outforundergrad.org/. 


We understand that students are going through many transitions at this time. To ensure that we continue to recruit the most diverse and high achieving LGBTQ+ undergraduate student candidates, I wanted to remind you that the 2020 O4U application is open, and ask that you share this information with your community at University of California, Santa Cruz. The student application deadlines are being extended from our previously announced dates. O4U is an amazing opportunity for students to meet recruiters from a variety of engineering firms and universities, with flights and hotels that are covered entirely by O4U. This means that if students are admitted from your college/university, they will only have to pay the $90 registration fee. We also work with students’ financial needs to make sure that if they are admitted to the conference, they are able to attend.


This year’s O4U Engineering Conference will be held in Minneapolis, Minnesota from September 11th to September 13th. The application deadline for round two admissions is April 26th, 2020 at 11:59 PM (EST).


Please let your students know about the conference application. Having attended the conference twice as a student, I can attest to the fact that it is an amazing opportunity for both professional and personal development. If you or anyone at your school has any additional questions/concerns, please feel free to reach out to me or the O4U Engineering Admissions Team at O4UEngineeringAdmissions@outforundergrad.org.


Thank you so much for your time, and have a great day!


Best,

Teddy Kurkoski

1. How do you sign up, and how do you pay? How much is it? (I only want to take ONLINE CLASSES from home. Do I still pay for campus fees?)

2. Does this screw with anything like make it look bad because I’ve been enrolled for more quarters? Or is that not a thing.... I am starting from zero knowledge. 

3. When do I have to sign up by/how long do I have to think about this? I just noticed that summer session is a term I can click on in the student portal. 

4. Is it the same if I take 5 units or 15? How do loans/financial aid work over the summer?

I hadn’t considered doing summer classes before this, but I’m thinking online classes might not be so bad if I’m probably going to be stuck at home with COVID 19 most of the summer anyway. 

Please let me know if you have any info or know who to ask :)",0.030208333333333354,0.5048611111111111,ucsc

2859,Should I attend UCSC or UCD? I am a psychology major.,1,2020-04-03 16:46:54,14,"So I am in a pickle right now. I have a month to make a college decision and I’ve been back and forth between these two schools. It’s hard because, due to the coronavirus, I don’t have the opportunity to do a thorough tour of both campuses so I’m basically making this decision based off what I’ve seen / heard on the internet. I am a transfer student, class of 2022, and am majoring in psychology. Davis would probably be cheaper for me, because of housing, but there’s a lot I like about Santa Cruz too (I’m a very outdoorsy person [avid surfer &amp; hiker] &amp; SC is only 30 min from home). 

What would you say are your favorite parts about attending UCSC (campus wise, academics wise, etc.) ? My main concern mostly is housing and how isolated the campus is. Have any of these factors been an issue for you guys? Also, what drew you to Santa Cruz and how happy are you with your decision? 

I love both schools so I feel sorta stuck. 

Thanks in advance, all input / perspectives are appreciated.

GPA (unweighted) : 3.90, GPA weighted: 4.50, SAT: 1470 

So I'm a decent-ish student and I applied to all the UC's and got into all of them except for Berkeley and UCLA, and got waitlisted for Davis which makes sense because for the past 4 years I've only focused on medical so I had no computer science experience whatsoever when I applied. I wanna stay in NorthCal (I'm from Bay Area). Right now, **I wanna decide between Merced and Santa Cruz just in case I don't get into Davis.** 

I wanna go to graduate school for sure so I wanna spend most of the next 4 years getting as many experiences and internships as possible so I wanna go to a university with opportunities. I'm also an outgoing student so I'm willing to go out of my way to get them, but it would be nice to go to a uni with connections. I also think that going to a smaller and less competitive university such as Santa Cruz and Merced would make it easier for me to stand out amongst my peers.  

I've also thought about double majoring in either biology or business. I'm not too sure about any of that right now, but that's also in the back of my mind when making this decision. 

And that's pretty much it about me. I know this post was all over the place (essentially just a brain vomit) but taking all of this into account, **which UC would you guys prefer: UCSC or UCM?** 

Also, is Merced's reputation really that bad? I wanna go to a competitive graduate school so does the undergraduate school matter as much as what you do during that time?",0.13144841269841273,0.4784391534391534,ucsc

2873,Email from Public Affairs and My Response,1,2020-04-03 22:43:02,19,"Dear Public Affairs and Chancellor,

I come to you respectfully during a dark time for not just the history of UC Santa Cruz, but during a dark time in our world, in our homes, and in our lives.

You have spent time accepting that, yes, our lives have changed from this situation. You have spent time accepting that we all had to make changes voluntarily and involuntarily to our lives, some that we may never be able to take back. And as a community we’ve accepted that we may lose loved ones: friends, family members, significant others, to this horrible crisis. Many students, including my own, lives will be changed forever, and right now all we can do is stay at home and try to live as normally as possible given the circumstances. Students that have worked years and years to get their degrees probably won’t even be able to walk at graduation. Students like myself who are in the 1st/2nd/3rd year are missing at minimum a quarter at maximum 2 or maybe even 3 quarters of their college education just have to accept that fact. And in order for us to continue our education, we have to take certain courses otherwise we will have to take a 5th year, and guess who that benefits? You. You continue to benefit during a terrible time for this world, while many students are straight up having their entire world, their entire life fall apart around them. And you can have the conscience to not only charge FULL tuition for an online school, but also charge campus fees when myself as well as many students will never even step foot on campus for this entire quarter. 

And you are a university that is publicly funded. Don’t give us this crap that the money is going towards “student referenda”, no one even knows what that means. You’re clearly stating things that don’t actually mean anything. You just want us to accept our place at this university, as piggy banks for you. To make an argument that you’re giving us the same quality education that you were while we were on campus just isn’t true. You aren’t the University of Phoenix right? I didn’t sign up for an online education, right? I never signed up for an education that is online, just like so many other students. So you can’t make the argument that you are giving me a quality education. Because a quality education is in person. You are doing the best you can to give me a quality education, which isn’t the same thing. Just two days ago, zoomhackers broke into my lecture (don’t worry it’s been reported and the necessary things have changed - don’t focus on this please for the love of all that is just in this world don’t focus on this one part), where students were sent racial slurs, hit on by sick people, and horrible images were shown. I’ve even heard from a friend that he had someone pleasuring themselves on camera. Tell me, where is the quality in that education? You can’t sit on your high horse and think, yes just because I have condemned that, the students will just roll over. I’m telling you right now, I am done rolling over for you.

I went out of my way to avoid strikes over these last 3 years. I believed that even with everything going on, you as a University have tried to do the best you can to make the best choices for everyone. I respect you as an institution enough, that I said “Yea, you know what some of these strikers are wrong”. But, that all changes here. You are robbing undergraduates, you are manipulating them. I have 6 months of preparation. I can’t even imagine we’ll come back in Fall quarter, and you better be prepared. We will commit to a strike, and you will not be able to stop this one this time. I will make sure every student is involved and I will make sure that the quarter we get back there definitely isn’t an instruction. It will not happen, because this involves everyone, even the students. Do not underestimate us on this one, you haven’t seen anything yet. There is too much time to prepare, and at the end of the day, students are the foundation of any university.

Which is why my final words to you, even with my nicely worded threat above, is me kneeling on my hands and knees to implore you not just to consider mercy, but to think of the students. Your PR isn’t great right now. The strikes never make you look good. Students are on edge. And as a student, I want to help those who need help, something you’re avoiding doing. At minimum, you need to release these “student referendums” exactly where these “campus fees” are going, and why you expect us to pay these fees in much more detail than in some big words that don’t mean a single thing. You need to show us how paying full tuition for online courses makes any sense at all, and if we as undergraduates accept those claims then fine, we can all move on. But if you plan to just sit on this, pretend myself and other students are just going to go away (you’re already being super weird with having all the students on campus go to a couple of buildings where yes they might have their own room but they’ll definitely share common space, which could lead to mass infection at the school), I want you to know we’re coming for you, and there won’t be a damn thing that is stopping us.

We will get the other UCs involved. This is going to happen.

Like me you probably have people in your  family that have lost their job and may lose their home. It will likely get worse before it gets better. Studying under these stresses is extremely difficult and can even seem futile. On top of all this we can’t really connect with the people that are our support groups and there will be a mental health toll felt throughout society. No one can give us answers to our questione either and like a fellow student told me recently: “This is a time when you find out who you really are, when no one tells you what to do or has answers”.

And now since I actually got here and started taking the classes there's been the whole blackouts thing in the fall, the strikes in the winter, and now the lockdown. On top of that in not a single of those quarters I have been able to join a class I was actually interested in because my major is impacted so the classes are full before I can even register.

I dropped out of high school 9 years ago because of an abusive home life, worked full time and did night classes at community college while raising my kid as a single parent, then applied to four years thinking college might never happen for me. 

The day I got into UCSC and the day I moved to campus were the days I felt like I had been waiting for for so long. I was so excited to be here. I loved it. Sure this school sucks sometimes but it’s also great. Two years has flown by and I have so many awesome memories. I’ve made so many great friends. My friends are the family who believed in me here because my own family didn’t. I did this on my own without them. And that felt so good. To not be dragged down by life anymore. 

I’m super disappointed commencement probably isn’t happening. Dropping out of high school means I didn’t walk that stage. I’ve been looking forward to walking the stage for a college graduation ever since. I’ve spent 9 years holding onto the moment I get to put a cap and gown on finally. It took so much hard work to get here. I have a 4.0 and worked so hard for it so I could make my son proud and graduate with honors in front of him. That probably isn’t happening now. And it’s one of the biggest disappointments ever. 

I’m moving tomorrow out of family housing. I spent all day packing. Im super sad that this is my college ending. Just had a good cry. Trying to feel all these feelings. 

Thanks my slugs. For being here the past two years. I know I’m not alone right now and that’s one thing helping me keep my head up.",0.23900192400192397,0.6052861952861953,ucsc

I graduated without in 2008 into basically the worst economy our generation had ever seen.  After graduating, I stayed jobless for nearly 2 years, eventually leading me to go back to school to get my masters.  Prior to that decision, there were times I felt truly useless, that I was a drag on my family, that I did not justify existence.

From the looks of things, you're going to be graduating into either a comparably bad economy, or a drastically worse economy.  I sincerely hope things get better; I do not want to see a repeat of my horror for you guys.  The pessimist in me says that's unlikely.

\- There is a stigma against UCSC as a lower tier UC and makes me feel socially inferior (I know this is arrogant, but I go to a very competitive school so Ive been plastered with this mindset)

first of all, a major thing swaying me from being all in about this school is the low number of black students. it’s an issue at all UC’s, but some deal with it better than others (ex. ucsb has a dorm hall for black students). also, to my knowledge, santa cruz is probably mostly white upper middle class tech people, which would of course lead to a different experience than if i went to school in a more diverse area like LA or Berkeley, but i prefer the forest to cities, i don’t know if i’d ever get into those schools, and i’m not a fan of cutthroat/competitive schools anyway. still, i’m mixed (black &amp; arab) and i’ve already spent most of my life as the only black/POC person in the room, and i’m wondering if there are any black spaces on campus/resources for black students. if anyone here has any feedback or can tell me about their experience being black/POC at ucsc, let me know :)

also, i’m generally quite far to the left and want to know about the politics in santa cruz. i know you guys like to strike, but i’m wondering if there’s a local DSA chapter, for example, or any other leftist organizations that are active in the community. 

lastly, i’d like to attend this school and study a mixture of psych, sociology, and poli sci (not sure which ones i should major/minor in yet), then eventually get my masters to become a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW), and i was wondering about the work/internship opportunities in those fields available around santa cruz?

I’ll checked my to do list in my portal and it says that I have to do my statement of legal residence confirmation so they can confirm I’m a legal resident, but in order for me to do my statements of legal residence it says I have to submit my intent to register then I would see the option in the menu because currently I do not see the option, and I was thinking, do I really have to pay the $400 fee of the intent to register before I could even see my correct financial aid summary?

I'm thinking about changing my major from Sociology to Cognitive Science, but couldn't find too much information regarding that specific change. I have taken most of the classes needed (except two classes) to declare for the major.

I emailed counseling and this is what they said:

&gt;Congratulations on your admissions to UC Santa Cruz! As Cognitive  Science was a screening major, you cannot petition to change your major  at this time. If you enroll at UC Santa Cruz, you can petition with the Psychology Department who oversees Cog Sci in the fall quarter to change  your major and it would be up to their discretion. One key aspect that  they will consider is if the major preparation courses are completed.  And even you have them completed, there is no guarantee they will  approve your petition. Please read the Transfer Information and Policy  from this link, [https://catalog.ucsc.edu/Current/General-Catalog/Academic-Units/Social-Sciences-Division/Psychology/Undergraduate-Program/Cognitive-Science-B-S](https://catalog.ucsc.edu/Current/General-Catalog/Academic-Units/Social-Sciences-Division/Psychology/Undergraduate-Program/Cognitive-Science-B-S), as it provides the most up to date major reparation requirement to see if you will meet the requirement by fall 2020.   
&gt;  
&gt;I  would also reach out to the Psychology Department now to see how they  have handled transfer student who want to change into their major. Their  contact information is provided at the bottom of this website, [https://admissions.sa.ucsc.edu/majors/cognitive](https://admissions.sa.ucsc.edu/majors/cognitive).

The due date for them to submit my grades was I believe March 3rd. I’m so lost right now I need help!!!!

3158,CS Curricula,1,2020-04-10 20:23:16,17,"Does anyone else feel like a good portion of things you learn in CS upper div courses at college are irrelevant. I really think CS curricula should be restructured to be more practical and less theoretical. Theory should be prioritized in grad school where the goal is to prepare students for a path in academia. I understand that most professors love theory because that's usually their area of research, but they should consider their students and how they will fair in the job market.

Most undergraduates who graduate are going to straight into industry and are expected to know x, y, and z. However, schooling didn't teach us x, y, and z. Instead, we learned about probability theory, calculus, and computational models. It seems like this has always been a big issue with CS departments in general. Students have to teach themselves technologies that are required by employers. However, how can we teach ourselves when all of our time is spent staring at equations and finite automata.

I feel like so much of my time and energy is wasted on learning topics that I will never see again. Instead, I could be dedicating my time to self-learning relevant topics such as react, node.js, .net, utilizing various cross-platform development tools, etc... Instead of requiring useless courses to graduate, new courses should be introduced that teach various frameworks and technologies that are essential for working in industry.

This issue mainly has to do with upper div CS courses. The lower division classes (apart from calculus) are required for getting a good foundation in CS. And shout out to courses like distributed systems, the software engineering series, algorithms, networking, and web apps which are actually useful. 

Anyways, rant over :)

3161,UCSC transfer,1,2020-04-11 02:05:40,7,"
Hey I just got accepted to UCSC as a transfer student for biology. I also received the regents scholarship which is a huge bonus. UCSC was never on my “list” for colleges but I applied anyways. As I’m learning more about the school I can see that there is a lot going on over there and it’s an interesting experience. 

I have a few questions so if anyone could help out with that it would be greatly appreciated. 

How hard would it be to change into bioinformatics from biology? 

(I have most of the pre reqs done for this major as I planned on getting a masters in it but just realized the offer an undergrad program for it) 

How is the overall college experience like? 

Would you recommend dorming for transfer? 
( I would really love to dorm but it’s crazy expensive like $20,000 for a double) 

How bad is the gym? (I’ve heard it’s absolutely horrible) 

What’s your favorite and least favorite thing about UCSC?

I will be starting in the fall (provided that the coronavirus crisis abates) at UCSC as a Biochemistry major. I've been researching the various residential colleges and I had a few questions about some of them, Crown and Kresge in particular. As of right now, Kresge is my first choice since I'm a big fan of maintaining the independence apartment living requires, but that could change if Crown provides me with significant enough career benefit. 

Crown
1. I've read that that Crown is the most ""STEM-y"" college; I was wondering if any of you all could speak to the accuracy of this description. 
2. The housing pages discuss the Science/Public affairs tables and the Undergraduate Research fellowships. How do those tables work? Are they are regular occurrence? How useful do you believe they are in providing STEM enrichment? 
3. As for the fellowships, my question is more broad. Does living in Crown help you get more access to research/internships, or is it the same as living in another? I will be perhaps a mid year sophomore or so when I start in the fall; could that impact that access?
4. Is Crown as quiet/introverted as I've heard? How easy is it to find social interaction outside of the college? 

Kresge
1. Is Kresge's core class, and/or living in the college itself difficult for non-English/Composition majors?

I'm a part of a group of four guys who are looking to get a C10 apartment. We were hoping to get 1-2 more people, either for a five- or six-person apartment. We're all C10 affiliates, to-be sophomores, and STEM majors.

To be candid, our lifestyles are pretty low-key: we're not into partying, smoking, drinking, or any of that really. We are chill with people who do, but ideally we'd prefer that they don't do any of that stuff in the apartment - or, at the least, hopefully we can come to an arrangement on what's fine and what isn't there.

If that doesn't fit your lifestyle, then I'd rather not risk a conflict of interest, and I wish you the best if you're looking for a group. But if this does seem like your kind of lifestyle, then feel free to message me. (Hopefully I'm posting this in the right spot.)

I'm not super social and into partying and stuff, but human interaction is fine. I'm from a suburb of Sacramento in Cali. I take lots of naps (looking for prime napping environment). 

Looking through all the college's sites, it seems like Crown is my kinda of my vibe. Is the so-called cardiac hill really that bad? Is it close enough to the stem classrooms? 

What would you say is the best housing floorplan to go with there? 

Also, if possible, do you think this college is what I'm looking for, or is another one better? I need to have the backups in case I don't get into that one or whatever.

I do consider myself an introvert but I become pretty extroverted once I find myself comfortable in a situation or group of people. As for partying, I'd prefer a more chill scene and I've heard Cowell is a little more hype. 

Rachel Carson is probably next, but I've heard their dining hall is going under construction this year. 

Oakes I'm not opposed to, it looks pretty far and I am half latina, but idk if I'm ~latina enough~. Maybe it doesnt matter. 

And a question about dining halls: I have a gluten allergy and I'm wondering if I should rely on dining halls at all or if I should figure out a stable microwave dinner sort of deal for myself.

I live in sacramento and was just accepted to UCSC with a solid fin aid package. Im wondering what the studio art program is like? I've been going on and off to community college for a couple years and want to finish my bachelor's. I'm interested in painting mostly. I heard 10% of students at UCSC are in the arts, but the US news and world report ranks UCSC as 65th on best art colleges. Wondering what your thoughts are on the program- I applied to a few other UC's as well.

3314,My final thoughts on my time here as a transfer &amp; film major,57,2020-04-14 02:08:54,28,"Warning this is straight up gonna be a vent post on my time here regarding mainly the quality of education I received. I’m not trying to be a negative Nancy however there are things that need to be said. Its pretty long.

TLDR : I never felt more cheated and disappointed in my life on the education I’ve received. My classmates and friends I’ve made here are the best thing about sc. Should have done better in cc, not sure how it is for regular 4 year students but it ain’t it for transfers. 

I’m a transfer student came in Fall ‘17 as a film &amp; digital media major wanting to pursue production. Transferred from a community college in the sf Bay Area. I just finished my last quarter here so I have some thoughts I wanted to get off my chest. I don’t really how to begin this but overall my undergrad experience has sucked, straight up. 

On the social side of things that was amazing. Porter A was wild, my classmates were hella cool, met some amazing ass people, and people in general here were literally so nice. So no complaints other than imma miss you all. 

But on the educational side of things it paled in comparison. When I was looking at my options for film schools their production department was the most important factor in my decision process, followed by tuition and housing costs. LA and NYC had the best options, but because the privates and out of state were wayy too expensive for me and my gpa was barely over 3.0 in cc ucsc was my best option. One of those factors was how hard they gassed up their production program it was hella much. During the tours, and when they visited my cc, they gassed it up. Like Nicholas cage dropped by, we have Emmy winners, we have connections, we have such a competitive production program, we have the best industry standard equipment, we’re ranked top 10 again, etc. I was gassed ngl. And then I went here. 

They have several options to choose from if you’re film. My goal was to get into the production concentration and take the big narrative senior exit course. To get to that point students have to go through lower divs, a mandatory theory class, a specific production track, and a mix of theory and production electives before you can be considered for the big senior exits. 

My first quarter I had to take the entry level intro to film class which I already took at my cc, but UCSC said my cc curriculum didn’t meet their standards. Wasn’t bothered because I thought I was gonna learn something new. I didn’t. It was a nice refresher but honestly a waste. 

My next quarter I took the mandatory theory class which is your gateway drug for anything else in film and for whatever reason came once or twice a year in a mid size classroom so if you couldn’t get in you were fuuucked. That was by far the most bs class I had ever taken in my entire academic career, I’m sorry if you had a good experience but that shit was whack and I didn’t learn anything. My TA was a straight up clown and was the most pretentious prick I’ve ever had. Like if you weren’t art hoey enough she’d look down on you. Sis it’s not that deep, you yourself said withhold judgment on others you don’t see eye to eye with. 

I still had that positive mindset, because the electives I was taking weren’t necessarily bad but at the same time didn’t bring anything new to the table. I wanted some woke ass film class and that had yet to arrive. I still held out because I finally got to start the production classes and bruh that’s when shit went south. Again they started plugging the shit out of the production classes and the production senior exits so I was gassed and ready until I actually started. 

To put it simply, I had learned 170B already back in cc. Every mechanical/practical thing the professor taught was VIA YOUTUBE VIDEOS. But she said don’t focus on that focus on story. Btw the cameras were outdated, there was five of them and they were shared between 50 fucking students between two classes. I don’t have that schmonies for a camera of my own and we HAD to use those cameras. But all those practical shooting methods, the editing, the work flow, how to wrap up a cable, I had already learned. I don’t know how it is for regular four year students, like I’m sure if you’ve never touched a camera and never used an editing software above iMovie or windows movie maker this would be useful, but everyone in my classes been knew this stuff and had already been making work. 

From there on out every production class i've had was shit. They focused on story story and story, not that story is wrong, but it was repetitive. Like bruh this camera has a 2,000 page manual please teach me how to maximize this. They didn't teach us about studio B other than to turn on a light and wrap a chord. One professor called color grading hocus pocus, one professor didnt know how to auto save even though he said it was very important that we try to do it, but he gave up on figuring it out. We no access to actors, but we were told to find actors who werent friends because our friends cant act, we were told to think practical but also think big, be realistic but also make a huge production, dont focus on dialogue but focus on visuals but also tell a story with dialogue. I mean I did it and made it into the production concentration and got into the 196 senior exit narrative, but I came in with nothing new to the plate.  

At this point you might be saying well why isnt this kid making the most of it? Well I did the best I could actually. Made projects with friends, did some freelance work, taught myself how to be creative with all the applications available to us, and used the facilities to work on my own projects. Additionally I did a summer semester at usc for their program (praise financial aid). I was so shocked and broken because it was so good, and that was the slap in the face over how much ucsc had flexed. I learned so much, I was taught brand new ideas/concepts/methods, the professors taught from experience and over half were still working in the industry on real ass shit. They enjoyed it and wanted to pass on their knowledge. Was it perfect? No. It still had its problems but I found myself stressing on things related solely to what we were working on. The actors were provided, the productions were paid for bc they didnt want us to pay out of pocket, there was a camera for everyone, everything was up to date. I never put ucsc on par with usc, but ucsc tried to be some edgy version of them so hard. I made friends from other schools like ucla and nyu and their experiences were similar to usc.

I felt so cheated and I felt so bad for my friends back at ucsc, because some of them are struggling over just trying to get a decade old camera and a person to act when they should be thriving. 

And one other thing, ucsc does not prep at all for post grad. If you're lucky you might get a class to do that, or you might find out about a program that takes a year to complete to get an internship. Couldn't take advantage of those. My cc film professor brought in an exec from universal to talk about post grad, ucsc showed us a youtube tedtalk about luck lmfao. Usc just threw the fucking industry at us. 

By the start of my last quarter here I had 3 different interviews, two as paid internships for television production, one as entry level multimedia production. All three of them mentioned usc on my resume, not one talked about sc other than when I was gonna finish. One dude literally said how impressive that it was to have gone to usc and he was impressed on what I did there. I had a mix of emotions, anger and pity on myself. Like was sc really not it? 

I’m trying to think of where I started out and me leaving this school, everything I have learned came from another school, my friends, or self taught. There was two classes I actually learned something, a directing class and sound production class to which those professors were passionate and taught from experience. Im not even gonna bring up our messy theory classes, they suck. 

After i started my production courses my mindset changed, I wanted more I got it elsewhere instead of here. I've been pretty silent on this because I had few classmates who were venting about their production classes to eachother in the hall and got shat on by the art hoes. They were called ungrateful and bratty. Im not a fan of confrontation, but the art hoes were wrong. I am also not a fan of settling when you know there is so much better out there. This is an unstable industry we have chosen to make a lifestyle out of, the road ahead is going to be difficult an enduring to put it lightly. People take a dump on us all the time saying make it hobby and go trade school. Once I figured out how many opportunities and how much there is to do with film, I wasn't bothered by the naysayers anymore. But with a school that claims something that its not, failing to prep some of the most talented passionate people i've seen, there is a problem here that just fucks everyone up and adds more obstacles. Obviously its not the case for everyone and people have done well. I do hope what I faced isnt the norm and I just caught a bad two years. Maybe it's more suitable for regular 4 years instead of 2 year transfers. 

Anyways its been a good run, go slugs! May you have amazing post quarantine glow ups and thrive in whatever area you want to go into.",0.11830433365917241,0.47595085022504385,ucsc

I was recently admitted for Fall 2020 into the Business Mang Econ program as a transfer student from a CC. I’m going to be choosing between UCSC and UCD. I love Santa Cruz as a city, I’ve visited many times and also toured the campus. I’ve read through some similar questions but I want to see some updated replies if possible. 

What do you think my best option for housing would be?

I want to be able to make new friends because I won’t know anybody but I heard on campus is pretty expensive. I have some family in SC that are willing to rent me a studio that’s about 15 mins away from campus for ~$1000 or less a month w/ out signing a lease but I’m afraid it would be difficult to meet new people living off campus.

3397,UCSC questions for anthro students/alum,2,2020-04-15 21:03:34,1,"Hi all, 

I applied to UCSC to transfer from Cabrillo as an anthropology major. Basically, I'm curious what makes UCSC's cultural anthro program undergrad stand out from others. I'm interested in general academic anthropology, but I'm also looking at Master's programs in applied anthropology, and generally feeling like that will be my best path. I'm an older student and my focus is definitely on being as practical as possible and building a career (with, I realize, a degree with a difficult reputation in that department.)

Basically I'm looking for any thoughts at all on why people might recommend UCSC's anthro program above others. For reference, I'm also looking at SJSU, but generally planning to stay in the area. 

While I would definitely appreciate intangible benefits like classes that are enjoyable and enriching, I'm especially interested in quantifiable differences between UCSC's anthro program and others, especially as it relates to the difficult task of making anthropology a viable career path. Does UCSC/the anthro department provide support for finding a career path? Are there classes and programs geared toward applying the knowledge instead of just pure academics? 

I've been finding it tough to answer these questions from a simple Google search. Thanks in advance for your thoughts!",0.07411145617667357,0.5575569358178054,ucsc

Today is the last day to swap/add classes, but I need an access code from the professor whose class I want to take. Well, none of them have gotten back to my emails, so it looks like I’ll be unable to swap into a new class. 

I’m wondering, what would happen if I withdrew from my chemistry class? I’m also pretty sure I won’t pass it... it’s incredibly hard, boring, and really hard to learn online especially in my house. 

How would having a “W” on my transcript affect me, and my GPA? Would I withdraw through my.ucsc account? When are the deadlines to do this? 

Please let me know all the info you know on this, thanks so much. Happy quarantining.",-0.04563131313131314,0.5951178451178453,ucsc

The petition includes four crucial provisions:

1. Expand testing locations by granting universities and private institutions the ability to test, using drive-through testing, and getting Department of Defense medics to staff mobile testing units.  
2. Expedite testing by directing UPS, Amazon, FedEx and USPS to coordinate on shipping.  
3. Improve data management by getting Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and others to consult on managing the huge flow of new data.  
4. Communicate clearly by getting the American Medical Association, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other medical experts to give clear guidance on who needs a test, where to get the test, and what to make of the results.

On top of this I have taken classes in Matlab, AutoCAD, solid works, and additional classes to full-fill a certificate of achievement in computer architecture; basically some intermediate c++ programming, assembly language, and theory on computer architecture.

1) what is and is not important? - math, physics, chemistry knowledge, important programming languages to know, etc.

2) where are places I can start looking for research/current research events (seminars)/lab jobs

3) are counselors at ucsc on engineering helpful? Should I even go to one? - what could I get from them versus what I can gather online?

4) what helpful services are not very known, but should be? Are there sites like this?

I'm just worried about not having a clear insight on what to do, and then the next thing I know is wasted my first year ""figuring things out.""

I recently got accepted to UCSC as a Computer Science transfer from Northern California for Fall 2020 (Yay!) However, right now I'm trying to decide between my two top choice right now which is UC Santa Cruz and CU Boulder. I don't really expect anyone here to know too much about CU Boulder but I'd love to hear about the CS department at UCSC and genuine feelings about majoring in CS at this school, the good, the bad, the ugly. Ive visited UCSC multiple times when some of my friends used to go there and one thing that really stood out was the amount of homeless people downtown and it didn't seem like there was very much to do. Also I was curious how the classroom/ lecture halls are for CS students.

I'm currently attending an LACCD college and am in a bit of a tight spot. I'm taking a class, Discrete Structures, and am majoring in Computer Science (Game Development). The class itself is a major requirement. Though I've received my acceptance, I'm now concerned that dropping this class will cause them to rescind me despite it being the only major requirement I'll be missing.

Though I don't want to drop the class it's caused me severe mental strain-- panic and anxiety attacks. The professor has not taught us anything and has only communicated with us ONCE after we made the online transition. We have our midterm in early May that I doubt I'll be passing-- I don't have the time to sit down and read through the text, unfortunately, because of my other classes.

My question, after all that rambling, is: How will my dropping of this class affect my acceptance? I know dropping it will leave an EW on my transcript and I don't want to drop a class I desperately need, but the mental strain is killing me and I'm having trouble deciding if it's worth it.

Note: There is also an option to room with me in the same size room for 750 monthly + utilities if you'd prefer but it will be a small space as it is the same single shared as a double. I would say I will be out most of the time. I will be in UCSC MAC graduate program so I will be in class or at another school doing student teaching majority of the time. I am male, 21, and would like a roommate who is also academically focused. I am typically an early bird and go to bed early but I am not sure how that will work with the intensive program so that may change.

All of us in the household are academically focused and are either graduating undergrad or graduate school this next upcoming year.
Let me know if you are interested and any information you believe may be pertinent",0.009642857142857144,0.34265873015873016,ucsc

This isn’t the time to talk about quarantine or politics or to promote your snapchat. Also I’ve noticed people love to show off their pets and then everyone starts oohing and aahing over how cute they are. Maybe before the lecture starts is fine, but right in the middle of class it’s just annoying. If this were a physical class it would be like yelling to your friends across a room and making everyone hear it. 

Even when the professor says to stay on topic people don’t listen, which is pretty disrespectful.  I can only imagine teaching a class is hard enough without social distancing and online learning, and people being distracting only makes it more difficult. 

Just be adults is all I’m saying. Keep the social chitchat out of the main lecture time. Don’t be disrespectful to your professor and classmates.",0.03970238095238094,0.5243452380952381,ucsc

Was recently admitted to UCSC. One of my professors have contacted me that she intends to drop me by the end of this week due to poor attendance on Zoom. Not gonna lie I haven't been going in class very often. I do have an A in the class though. 

My prof will be online tomorrow and I intend to implore her to not drop me from the class and explain my situation to her. I have no guarantees that she'll change her mind - crossing my fingers.

I emailed my counselor on this, and will also email UCSC admissions as well soon. Class in question is a COMM 100 class, and it's not required for my major. If dropped, I will be at 58 semester units, 2 short of the 60 needed. This is including AP classes. 

My cc counselor sent an email over, asking if they'll let me in as long as I make up the 2 units via an online class over the summer a couple hours ago.

As of right now, am I fucked? If anyone has experience with this, that would be great",0.017321428571428578,0.47107142857142853,ucsc

I'm an admitted transfer student and upon trying to accept my offer of admission I saw the selection for what my living situation would be: off-campus or on-campus housing. The financial aid offer I received from UCSC took into account me living off-campus as that's the choice I made when I filled out the FASFA (retrospectively, a mistake). 

I now wish to live on campus but I am wary of selecting that as I'm worried that my financial aid will not be revised to reflect the increase in cost. Was wondering if anybody was able to make the switch with your financial aid offer or know that it is possible? Just don't wanna get screwed and be stuck with the initial offer and have to pay the difference out of pocket or something. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

TL;DR : New transfer student wondering if the financial aid offer that was bassed on me staying off-campus will be revised and I will get more aid if I select on-campus housing.",0.1336898395721925,0.38703208556149726,ucsc

unfairnes by teachers. them not listening to student situations. loads of homework. overal a feeling of talking to a wall thats continually kicking you in the ass.


but see. thats where we are now. there is no response because there isnt a good one to give. see these from the point of view of the teacher or school:

bad internet? damn haha that sucks. 


no resourses? school: haha your cute... spend money you dont have to buy them haha?


i am going batshit insane because i am heavily overwhelmed by a duality of the school being unprepared for this situation and me not having/access to resources/options/time/mental health/etc to be able to take it on!?!? .... School: damn haha but you can take your non major classes pass no pass haha


This situation sucks. No one can ease your pain because they simply cant. The school doesnt want to say it but the only way you can survive this right now is 1) to shill out money to get stable internet, technology, and off site tutoring help/resourcs during this pandemic but they really cant because it would be bad PR.


I have terrible resources. I live in a farm valley. Cows are breed next to my home. the internet changes with the change in temperature. summer weather makes it impossible to go online form around 12-5pm.



i have emailed my department. 


**this is the hard truth but i understood it**


they recommend i take a leave of absence that i cannot afford to take.


it sucks but this is the world we are in. that is the most honest and best solution they can give. they also are human. they know the problems we face. that is the best option.


the best you can do is email your department. state your problem and pray that the mob mentality may override to pass no pass quarter if this is what you need.",0.06954529056801784,0.48160173160173164,ucsc

now with ucsc doing summer online and most likely fall being online, i don’t know if i should just go back to a CC this fall and take more of my classes online there, or if i should still be going thru with fall at ucsc but paying an extreme difference for it to still be just online.

i feel really frustrated and confused on what to do, i haven’t had a real “college experience” and online-only has limited my social interactions and makes my anxiety a bit worse.. i’m also a first gen for uni and don’t have a lot of feedback from my family/friends on what i should do. i also wanted to study abroad and now with everything going on i would have to push that into my senior year. the major thing holding me back is that i graduated high school in 2016 and i’m watching a lot of my friends finish their degrees this spring, so waiting another year to transfer makes me get down on myself, which i know is dumb but i can’t help but feel that way):",-0.03105753968253968,0.3669206349206349,ucsc

**All buses will stop running after 8pm.** Routes 3, 15, 20D, 22, 40, 41, 68, and 74S will not run at all.

You must wear a face mask when riding the bus. This does not need to be medical grade; you can use something like a scarf or bandana. You must stay at least 6ft away from other passengers, and do not sit in any blocked off seats. Board through the rear door if possible. 

Remember, the buses should be used for essential travel only (going to work, buying groceries). Bus operators can screen passengers for essential travel requirements, and may deny boarding. You must have current to employer identification stating that you are an essential employee to ride route 17.

All UCSC routes will run once an hour, and will depart the Metro Center at the following times:

|Route 19|Route 16|Route 20|Route 10|

Hello, incoming freshman here. I am a little confused about the meaning of this email I just received. It says that due to the possibility of online classes next year, there is no longer a housing guarantee for incoming freshmen. 

Does this mean that it is possible that there still could be in-person classes but I don't receive housing?

Or if by next year we do end up having in-person classes, will freshman be given this guarantee again?

This could seriously impact me as I don't think I would be able to afford off-campus housing.

Thanks for your help last time. Today I'm wondering if there is anyone who did a Dual/Concurrent Enrollment in Community College program in high school (you were not a transfer student, but a first year student with extra credits) and accumulated many credits for university. If you did, I'm curious...

1. Did all of your credits transfer, or was UCSC selective about it? [Assist.org](https://Assist.org) doesn't list all of the classes, at least for the community college I attended, and I'm hoping that I'll be able to transfer all of the ones that are UC transferrable. I'm not sure and Admissions directed me to Assist. 
2. If they did, were you able to use all the credits to fulfill your major requirements and GEs, or were they solely given as elective credits? I took first first quarter English at CC; would it fulfill the writing requirement? 
3. Since you had a head start on college, what did you do with it? Did you graduate early? Take on additional majors and minors? What do you recommend? 

If it makes any difference, I attended Foothill College in Los Altos Hills and will have done 85 quarter units.

Any answer'd be appreciated it. Good luck all!",0.1776388888888889,0.4136419753086419,ucsc

I think we have to stick to a few points if we want him to listen. Namely, that while we are testing, both ProctorU and specifically the employee monitoring our exam has full remote access to our device and can look through our information. Along with that, the fact that ProctorU can give our info to undisclosed third parties via their ToS and that they will hand data over in the event of buyout or bankruptcy. 

Some points: ProctorU does not ask for your SSID, but can access information like that on your device files. 

That was a mess, but I think its still worth the fight, just for the future at least. I don't feel safe with anyone having access to my information even if they promise not to collect it.  Thank you guys so much for fighting this.

If he somehow had some way to avoid their accessing our files, I honestly might be okay with that, though still unhappy. That could be a decent compromise for now.

Each college also seems to have a stereotype surrounding it. I've heard that Merill attracts gamers, and Cowell and Stevenson can be fratty.

3901,"Struggling HS Senior, Please Read",1,2020-04-30 18:03:11,14,"Hi everyone, I’m a high school senior from Humboldt County. I applied to a few UC schools and got in to SC, SB, and SD. 

UCSC was my dream school and main target, I wasn’t expecting to get in to SD or SB. Being from Humboldt, I adore the redwoods and the culture in SC seems to be similar to HumCo. My best friends and some family live in the Bay Area and it’s also the closest campus to home. I’ve heard that SC also is a good place for introverts and more alternative people like myself that feel like they can have a hard time “fitting in.” I dont care about school spirit or greek life either, so I like that that doesn’t seem as prevalent. 

I’m just so conflicted. I’m a psych major, and I know how impacted the program is, but I really just adore the campus and the vibe of SC so much. But I’ve also seen so much pessimism about people hating it. 

Then there’s the prestige factor. I feel almost obligated to go to SB or SD because they’re higher ranked schools. I feel like I’d like the SC area and culture so much more, but is it worth it to sacrifice more prestigious institutions for that? I don’t like the party culture at SB and SD is just so far away,  but am I completely stupid for turning down those offers, 

And, lastly, my dad works in the concert industry and my mom was seriously injured a few weeks ago so they’re both out of work. My dad lives out of state so now we’re getting no financial or physical support from him. I’ve been picking up the slack and taking care of my family, so when SC sent out an email about being able to defer to fall 2021 I was excited, because it would make so much more financial and family sense for me to start later. Then I read in the COVID frequently asked questions you can only defer due to health reasons, military, or travel restrictions cause of the virus. 

Being able to defer was the deciding factor for me to choose SC. Now the day before decision day, I don’t even think I can. I’m so sad and devastated and lost. I have no idea what to do. If anyone can offer any kind of advice I’d really appreciate it.",0.1376823109140182,0.40622144792876497,ucsc

He then sends everyone an email “100 out of 130 students submitted correctly. Thank you for your time”

Hello University of California-Santa Cruz Students,

My name is Jorge Castro, a 3rd year psychological science student at the School of Social Ecology at University of California-Irvine. I am currently doing a research project for a class and looking for 8 participants to conduct interviews with. The focus of my project is to investigate the role of religion in college students and its relationship with experience of psychological distress. The interview will take about 30 minutes and is done in one session. They will be administered mainly through Zoom; but, Skype will also be an alternative if this is more preferred or accessible. Below is the ideal criteria to be eligible for the interview:

1. Being a UC Undergraduate Student (any class student)

2. Identifying with a religious group

3. Had experience of anxiety or depression and are comfortable with talking about it

If any one of these fits with you and are interested in being interviewed, please email me at Jorgeac3@uci.edu so we can set up a time that is most convenient for us both.

As my CS senior year comes to an end, I sorta regret not getting more involved in research and some of the more niche fields of CS and software engineering. I have a general idea of what kind of specific fields within software engineering I’d like to get into in the future but it seems that most people in those roles at tech companies have PhDs or masters. My employer has an educational stipend so cost isn’t too much of a factor, and I won’t be working very far (San Jose).

With all that being said, I don’t even know if I’d be accepted in the CS grad program. My gpa is okay (~3.3) but I do have a few internship experiences and maybe some full time experience with tech companies over the hill may help? I’m not even sure if CS grad programs care about that type of experience. 

Are most people in the program fresh out of bachelor?   Are they mostly looking for more theory and research oriented people? Any of your thoughts on the CS grad program here are appreciated!",0.24904761904761907,0.4685185185185185,ucsc

What I don't understand is if NP is an option for a CSE class required for a CS degree since that class has to eventually be graded. For a W you can retake it (I assume) and have the W replaced with a grade. If I request an NP before the deadline can I retake it for a grade? Or would it only be replaceable with a P, meaning that it would mess up my degree?

Having midterms this week in classes where there has been very little graded so far, I doubt the midterm grades will be know by this Frday so I will have no idea about how I am doing in the course before the W deadline. It would be preferable to wait until the 29th where I would hopefully have some idea of how I've done so far but I don't know if that's an option.",-0.04375,0.765,ucsc

So I was just notified that I have been taken off the waitlist for this fall. Before this, I was planning on deferring my enrollment to SDSU and taking a gap year to study and intern in China where I grew up since they are opening back up, and I am lucky still to have connections there with family and friends. My declared major at SDSU is international business and I got into the Global economics program at UCSC. I know I eventually want to get a career related to international business. My economics class was also probably my favorite class in high school. Since UCSC is saying on their website that they will be accommodating deferrals, I am strongly considering making the switch. Although I am aware I shouldn’t base my decision off of this, I do prefer the location and size of this school more than SDSU. If anyone has anything to share about the Global Economics program, Chinese language program, and student life I will greatly appreciate it as I need to make a decision by the end of this week.

&gt;A withdrawal from a class (W) is GPA-neutral: instead of a grade, you receive a W notation on your transcript which does not affect your GPA; you also don’t earn credits for the course. The class and W remain on your schedule and transcript; this allows you to remain in full-time status for financial aid purposes, but not for **international students’** F1/J1 purposes. Once the W petition is filed, you stop attending the class and focus on your other classes.

&gt;What's an NP?

&gt;A NP (No Pass) is also GPA-neutral; it appears on your transcript and does not affect your GPA; you also don’t earn credits for the course. Once you request an NP, it will appear on your record even before grades are reported at the end of the quarter.",-0.034374999999999996,0.159375,ucsc

I'm a CS Major from the Bay Area who just got in to UCSC off the waitlist (yay).

I've been looking in to all the UCSC colleges since I got in but I'm still kind of lost on which one to choose and was hoping some of y'all could help me out with some recommendations.

A bit nerdy still but shifting away from the shut-in gamer I was freshman and sophomore year of high school so don't really want to be fully surrounded by gaming life (like I think Crown is from my moderate research), not really a big party/fratty person so I wouldn't want to be plunged right into the middle of all that right away (but I'd like a bit of the party life, or at least the option of it). Good food, good views, and good hikes are nice but not a must, don't mind the drug/stoner stereotype, CS major as mentioned so it'd be nice to be around some more sciencey peeps.

(Also side note but what exactly is 9/10 like because from my research I've basically only seen that they're new and Asian and not much else. If there's any defining traits of the colleges y'all would like to chime in I'd love to hear them!)

Thanks so much for everybody's help and I can't wait to be a part of the community

4113,"Freshmen, consider community college",1,2020-05-06 00:28:49,48,"I wanted to write this as a PSA for incoming Freshpeoples or really anyone still working on General Ed: With classes all being online, consider community college for your general ed. I'm saying this as a transfer student who paid about $500 max per semester(Not counting textbook costs which I got from lib gen anyways) for my general education. According to the local community college, a full time semester would cost $629^[1](https://www.cabrillo.edu/services/ar/fees-fallspring.html)


I transferred into UCSC this last Fall with 91.5 quarter units, which isn't even the maximum of 70 semester units or 105 quarter units.^[2](https://admissions.ucsc.edu/why-ucsc/faq/student-transferring.html) 

Since then I'm scheduled to graduate either this summer or next Fall(only because I'm taking 20-30 units per quarter like a dumbass). With no financial aid my tuition alone is about ~$5600 per quarter except for Summer quarter which should cost me $6588.78^[3](https://financialaid.ucsc.edu/cost-to-attend/summer-costs.html) with the ambitious student award^[4](https://summer.ucsc.edu/how-to-enroll/index.html) and except for next Fall being $3763^[5](https://registrar.ucsc.edu/enrollment/part-time-program/index.html) due to being part-time. All together this means that I'll be paying a total of either $27,151.78 or $23,388.78 for my UCSC education depending on whether I take classes in Fall. This is also with me buying the school health insurance at a cost of $1000 per quarter which you shouldn't have to do if you're under 25. That's also not including the $1100 per month I'm paying for housing but if class is online you probably won't have to worry about that.


According to collegecalc.org students should budget **$36,217**^[6](https://www.collegecalc.org/colleges/california/university-of-california-santa-cruz/) for a year at UCSC. This includes $16,448 in housing but even without that it's still $19,769. That's a whole lot of money. And that's a whole lot more than you'll be paying at Cabrillo or another community college.


So what are you paying for here? This is where it gets anecdotal. 
What I personally found(pre-covid) is that there are a ton of opportunities here for networking. There are labs you can work with. There are panels from prestigious speakers and grad schools. There are professors you can work with and get to know and hopefully get letters of recommendation from. There are classmates you can meet in study groups and a whole bunch of really cool ways to make yourself stand out and increase your breadth of knowledge if you're willing to put yourself out there. There are very few other places where you get to interface with people who are on the cutting edge in their respective fields. In addition, I've personally found that being around other students here is incredibly inspiring. Banana Slugs are generally really awesome and it's amazing being around so many passionate, intelligent, and driven people. However, the majority of those things are currently unavailable as long as classes are online. 

Additionally(and again, anecdotally), I found that the level of engagement from professors in classes to be much higher at community college than I did here. 

So in case it's not clear, every advantage that you'd be paying for by going to a UC for your general education is somewhat nullified by online classes. I highly recommend that as this pandemic continues and online classes continue to be the norm, you get your general education done at a fraction of the price.

I’m planning on taking Chem1A over the summer but I’m nervous as I barely learned any chemistry in high school, and what I did learn was like 3 years ago. I’m going in with almost no foundational knowledge. 

Any advice on where to get started studying early? If anyone has a PDF of the 1A textbook (or the name or ISBN of it) or other helpful online resources of where I can start to get a foundation, I would really appreciate it! I want to start now because I’m worried the accelerated 5-week course will be easy to fall behind in.

I sent in an appeal because I am aware that if you send one regardless of whether you weren't offered admission then you are still on the waitlist. I sent an appeal just a couple of days ago and have already heard a response back just today. Sadly, they said they weren't going to accept my appeal, but it didn't state anything regarding my waitlist. Now, this is where I am a bit confused because I went on my student portal and it basically stated that they were still reviewing applicants for fall 2020 and that an evaluation of my application will be concluded by May 10th. I am confused because my original waitlist information stated I would be notified around mid-June at the latest. May 10th is way earlier than I expected and for some reason, I'm not sure if it's regarding my waitlist so I am asking if anyone else on the waitlist has a similar message on their student portal?

For the past three years, I have paid for my car, my food, my school, insurance, my entertainment, etc. with the earnings my two (sometimes three) job. I just do not pay rent because my grandparents asked me to move in with them after high school and did not want rent.

I find it absolutely absurd that because the people who birthed me (beyond that they are irrelevant in my life) live in Texas, I am an out of state student unless I can pass the “100% financial self-sufficiency test”.

4157,UCSC has drained my aspirations for research and higher education,1,2020-05-06 22:08:43,20,"Two years ago, I joined UCSC as an Applied Physics major, and was hoping to get involved with interesting research before graduating. Topics brought up in my modern physics classes at junior college really inspired me, and I was excited to be at a research university.  

During my time here, I spent a lot of time getting into connection with various research professors and groups. Eventually what I found, is that almost every professor and graduate student here have immense responsibilities and roles. Graduate students are under compensated. Research is often extremely theoretical, and unaccommodating for undergraduate students. The people who do well in this type of environment are often extremely insensitive and cold, and sometimes this is masked by a charismatic personality.  

I have heard from classmates that dealing with Postdocs at UCSC is frustrating, because they have little reason to care about undergraduate affairs, and that professors are similar. I faced this dilemma too. I was part of a group in the EE department, and I was put under supervision of a Postdoc who exhibited no care. The actual research professor was so busy that I was hardly able to communicate with him. In general, I have seen countless of my peers over stressed and underappreciated by their research professors.  

I have also witnessed an unhealthy standard of goals for people in my department to get their name on a research paper or two before graduating. People look to get involved with projects in hopes of getting their name written on them, and professors often inspire students into positions which are extremely difficult and unrewarding, just because it ends up helping the professor in the end.  

Needless to say, I have gained something positive: a realization that graduate school and research is not for me. Thank you UCSC and your professors.",-0.003909090909090921,0.5608181818181819,ucsc

Well I checked my portal and it still has the to-do notification indicating that I didn’t fix this problem even though I clearly did. This is a problem for me because I have until this Saturday (May 9th) to make a decision on my admission. Since I am the first person out of my siblings to go to college, and my parents not being knowledgeable on this topic, the biggest thing for them is the price tag of about $37,000 a year going to this school. This also adds up to about $150,000 for the whole 4 years. 

Before getting off of the waitlist, I was committed to community college. But UCSC has been a top choice for me and I would love going there.

4223,UCSC (TIM + BMEcon) vs UCSB (Statistics and Data Science),1,2020-05-08 12:09:26,8,"Hello everyone! I'm currently a 2nd year here double-majoring in Technology Information Management and Business Management Economics. I was recently accepted to UCSB for Statistics and Data Science but I'm having a hard time deciding between if I should stay at UCSC or transfer to UCSB.

After undergrad, I know that I want to pursue a career as a business analyst or product management; I've been really interested in anything that involves a combination of business + data/tech + consulting skills. I have some sort of feeling that my major combination at UCSC already sets me up pretty well for this sort of profession. I was comparing the classes/curriculum charts between the 2 schools and I noticed that the electives for my BMEcon degree aren't really available at UCSB. In addition, I've already taken some econ upper-divs at UCSC and apparently they don't transfer over since I'd have to take UCSB's version of ECON 100A, which is notoriously known for being one of the hardest classes at UCSB... However, given that data science/analysis has been a hot topic nowadays, I feel like I might be more marketable (?) if I earned this sort of degree from UCSB. I'm also not too sure which school would provide me with better networking/recruiting opportunities for this type of career, since I know a decent amount of peers at both schools that have been able to land solid consulting jobs and internships at Big 4 firms.

Basically, I'm tossed up between: 

\- UCSC: double-major, more interesting classes (business management side), able to ""keep"" my economics classes, more of a comfortable environment for me (I've always been a Bay Area person)

\-UCSB: more marketable degree, more interesting classes (statistics/data science side), opportunities to meet new people and network, overall a ""better"" school than UCSC, change of environment

4237,Shivika for SUA President! (and other election material),1,2020-05-08 16:39:13,2,"Before I start this ad for [Shivika](https://i.imgur.com/mqN82Zy.jpg), I also want to make a pitch for a [SUA Constitutional Amendment](https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/elections/pdf/2020/sua-constitutional-amendment-2020) that's on the ballot. Currently, the SUA allocates 20 seats to college governments, and only 5 seats to student organizations, which only hold around 17% of the total voting power (a much less, given that only 3 of the seats allocated for student organizations were actually filled this year).

If you aren't satisfied with the communication of SUA, its responsiveness, or how well it represents campus, then opening up more seats for student organizations is a step towards fixing these issues.

If you are a member of a student organization, please push them to reach out to SUA on how to get a voting seat on that board.

## Vote Shivika Sivakumar for SUA President!

**Shivika Sivakumar** is a second-year Computer Science and Politics double major running for SUA President. She's done good work promoting [diversity in tech with GraceHacks](https://www.santacruzworks.org/news/gracehacks-is-dedicated-to-close-the-gender-gap), improved how SUA was running the 2019 election (they were originally _manually_ checking for repeat votes), and helped reduce the price of textbooks and homework as well as distribute free academic supplies. Most recently, she was [emailing the Dean of BSOE](https://i.imgur.com/3jtMmtQ.png) to allow for P/NP courses to be taken for major requirements.

&amp;nbsp;

Shivika's platform is a campaign for **CHANGE**. This is made up of six parts, *C*risis Management, *H*elpline, *A*gile, *N*avigating New Necessities, *G*uarantee Support, and *E*ngage. I'll give an overview, but you can read more indepth on her [8-page detailed platform](bit.ly/shivika-for-president-platform
).

&amp;nbsp;

* **Crisis Management**: This year has shown that SUA needs to be more prepared for times of crisis. The formation of a crisis task team (composed of medical support, public relations, UCPD Liaison, Adminstration Liaison, Third Party liaison) will give SUA the flexibility to respond to the unanticipated.

* **Helpline**: One consistent criticism about SUA is that students don't often know or interact with the body. An online help desk, built and supported by UCSC students, can help students find the right resources they need to tackle issues they face (lack of testing accommodations, concerns about academic policy, or lost on campus). Think of the Residential Assistant On Call System, but adapted to deal with the UCSC Admin.

* **Agile**: This point is more on reforming how SUA works to be more flexible and responsive.

* **Navigating New Necessities**: SUA needs to be prepared for new issues that are happening due to COVID. While students still have to deal with remote learning, SUA should be there to ensure that students are getting the same quality of education that they're paying for. If students can return to campus, SUA should partner with clubs, ethnic orgs, and other student groups to promote campus solidarity after these stressful times.

* **Guarantee Support**: When organizations like CALPIRG and Black Student Union already have efforts promoting student interest on things like sustainability, strengthening minority communities, or student advocacy, SUA should support them. SUA should be more receptive to the initiative already taken by students to tackle campus issues, and should aid these efforts.

* **Engage**: Outreach is a consistent criticism about SUA (as mentioned earlier). SUA should be reaching out to students over more platforms and by conducting more surveys. Without a constant source of feedback from the student body, how else can SUA improve?

&amp;nbsp;

You can find out more information about Shivika on her website, [shivikaforpresident.com](https://shivikaforpresident.com/index.html) and [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shivikaforpresident/).

I'm pushing Shivika to hold an AMA on r/UCSC to respond to questions about her campaign. If there's enough interest, I think she can get one scheduled ASAP!

I really can't tell any other differences between the programs at each school other than SB seemingly having more required credits for the geology emphasis. The programs also are ranked like right next to each other on every list I've looked at.

How have earth science majors, specifically geo majors, liked the program at SC and how do you think it compares (to SB or in general)? Is there something more specific that I should look at to compare them? I'd appreciate any guidance",0.21594387755102037,0.4204081632653061,ucsc

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Could you help us understand how emotions buffer people against stress experienced by immigrants?

To participate in this study, you need to be

1. 1st (International students) or second-generation immigrant and
2. In college or graduate school

You will only take some short online surveys (25 minutes long). We don't collect any information on immigration status or physical address. 1 in 5 participants will win a $25 Amazon gift card. This study satisfies the criteria for Exempt Research.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**This research can help identify more protective factors for immigrants with fewer resources.** **Further , this study hopes to contribute to reducing health disparities in immigrant families.** If you want to know more about this project, please reach me by direct message.

And because of everything happening and remote instruction my grades have been slipping and it’s like all the hard work I put in was worthless. I was barley on track to graduate on time with summer school. Now I might have to add another quarter. I have so much pressure at home to graduate on time and get a job right away. And that might not even happen if we enter a recession. I never even told my parents I had to change my major because I was failing and would just be a disappointment since I’m the first of my siblings to actually be close to graduating and not dropping out. But I’m so ready to just give up and drop out. Even a leave of absence wouldn’t motivate me to want to come back to school. And everyone’s basically counting on me to get a job and help my dad get a house so we can stop living with my aunt. And I’m sad I can’t tell anyone how I’m really struggling in school because I’ll just be called a failure.

Incoming CS transfer from De Anza here. Like the title says I definitely want the social aspect of college and love having easy access to the recreation facilities - makes it a lot easier to get a daily workout in if it's right outside my front door vs. a mission to reach it, ya know?

I'm a bit of an unholy nerd-jock hybrid, so if I end up doing keg flips with my bros every night I'm totally down, but I wouldn't mind having a few people around taking a similar program as me to hang and possibly room with. Are CS students an endangered species at Stevenson/Cowell?

For anyone in that position, what's the commute to upper div CS/math like? Should I bring my car (assuming this is probably a no go with parking), or buy a bike?

Also, the grapevine has whispered that Stevenson has better housing than Cowell. Is this hearsay true?

Current Rankings:

1. STEVENSON
2. COWELL
3. TEN
4. NINE
5. CROWN

Think I should throw Porter in as a transfer even though it's opposite the gym?

Of course this could all be totally irrelevant - we'll know within a few weeks. Strongly considering deferring (if I'm allowed to) if they announce online only in the fall. I am a social butterfly and I need to burst out of my cocoon 😭. If we do end up on campus hit me up for disc golf, or 1v1s in basketball or rocket league!",0.06917388167388168,0.4011183261183261,ucsc

(1) How do we list our roommates? I have a friend I'm interested in rooming with, but we were only allowed to set our dorm college preferences as of now.

(2) When are we usually assigned our dorm colleges? (Traditionally, I know things are subject to change as of now)

(3) Can we switch roommates if we don't like someone?

4288,Delay in Fall Enrollment,5,2020-05-10 11:48:34,20,"Dear UCSC graduate and undergraduate students:

We wanted to let you know that the campus has made a decision to delay fall 2020 enrollment. Originally scheduled for May 20, enrollment in fall will open June 17. We are working on setting up appointment times in MyUCSC, and you should be able to see these in MyUCSC by 5:00 PM, Wednesday, May 13. The fall Schedule of Classes should be available on Friday, June 5.

As a campus, we need the extra time to plan for the possibility that not all students may be able to safely return to campus this fall. To accommodate this, many lectures and seminars may need to be offered either fully-remote or with a remote option. Likewise, classes that are typically offered in person may be subject to social distancing or other alternative setups that may impact room use, attendance patterns, and more. The coming weeks will be a critical time for departments and divisions to review their curriculum needs, for the campus to determine the best -- and safest -- way possible to offer fall classes.   

Best wishes for your success and safety,

Tchad Sanger

4296,Vote Yes on the Constitutional Amendment,1,2020-05-10 17:37:00,4,"For more diverse ideas and perspectives in the SUA, please vote Yes on the Constitutional Amendment May 11 to May 20.

**How will it bring more diverse ideas?**

Background on proposed amendment:  [https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/elections/pdf/2020/sua-constitutional-amendment-2020-background](https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/elections/pdf/2020/sua-constitutional-amendment-2020-background) 

The ten representatives elected by each college will be elected at-large using single-transferable vote. Students will be elected based on their platforms rather than their college-affiliation.

**What is single-transferable vote?**

Single-transferable vote is a form of proportional representation used in some shape or form in most UCs and on a larger scale in some national elections in Ireland and Malta and for the Australian Senate.

People will rank the candidates in order of their preferences. Not all candidates have to be ranked. Then the votes will be distributed either two ways: There are more than 10 candidates left, therefore the lowest candidate is eliminated and their votes are transferred to others &lt;OR&gt; A candidate has reached the quota and their excess votes are distributed to other candidates. I do not think the specifics of the version of STV the amendment is proposing has been published but that is more-or-less how it works. For an individual to be elected, they either have to reach the quota or the number of candidates left is one more than the needed number to fill up the rest of the un-elected seats.

Example:

There are 3 seats to be contested for (in real life 10). The first preferences are

Quota = votes / first-preference votes = 2505 / 3 = 835

Note: this may not exactly reflect how the STV goes as the details has not been published as far as I know. There may not be a quota, the equation for the quota might be different, and/or the excess votes will not be distributed.

|Slug|1000 (Elected, excess of 165 is distributed)|
|:-|:-|
|Turkey|500|
|Coyote|400|
|Seal|305|
|Otter|200|
|Whale|100|

Then...

No one reaches the quota, Whale is eliminated.

|Turkey|590 (+90)|
|:-|:-|
|Coyote|405 (+5)|
|Seal|315 (+10)|
|Otter|205 (+5)|
|Whale|110 (+10) (Eliminated, distributed)|

Then...

No one reaches the quota, Otter is eliminated.

|Turkey|590 (+0)|
|:-|:-|
|Coyote|405 (+0)|
|Seal|365 (+50)|
|Otter|245 (+40) (Eliminated, distributed)|

Then...

No one reaches the quota, there are 3 candidates left, the top two candidates are elected without reaching the quota.

|Turkey|610 (+20) (Elected)|
|:-|:-|
|Seal|555 (+190) (Elected)|
|Coyote|410 (+5)|

I'm confused on which courses I can bypass and what I do with credits that don't apply to specific Gen-Ed categories.

Here's a list of AP Exams I've taken and passed with a 3+ and what they translate to:

1. AP CSP -&gt; 8 credits, CSE 10
2. AP CSA -&gt; 8 credits, CSE 20
3. APES -&gt; 4 credits, Gen-Ed PE-E
4. AP Psych -&gt; 4 credits, Gen-Ed PE-H
5. AP World -&gt; 8 credits, Gen-Ed CC
6. AP Gov -&gt; 4 credits, Gen-Ed CC
7. AP Stats -&gt; 4 credits, Gen-Ed SR
8. AP Lang -&gt; 8 credits
9. APUSH -&gt; 8 credits
10. APHUG -&gt; 4 credits

So my questions are:

1. Can I use a course like AP Psych to bypass the CC requirement even though it translates to less than 5 UCSC credits?
2. If I can't use Psych because it is below 5 units, can I use AP Psych and APES together, which make 8 credits combined, to fulfill the requirement?
3. For the courses that translate to credits and no GE's, what do I do with them/ what is their purpose?
4. What can I do with AP CSP and CSA? Do they do anything for the Computer Science Major Requirements?",-0.14083333333333334,0.3183333333333333,ucsc

While ik learning the material is the most important thing, GPA is also important to me as I plan to attend grad school. Is there a difference in each year, like freshman year is easy to do well in and junior year is hardest?

I am also interested in the difficulty of summer courses at UCSC, I am interested in taking them but as they are online I don't want to hurt my gpa right off the bat by taking a college course virtually where it would hurt my gpa.",0.26561507936507933,0.6542261904761905,ucsc

4348,PSA: ECE upper division majors courses may be taken for P/NP with passing grades counted towards major's goals,1,2020-05-12 11:27:58,0,"Here's the email that was sent out:

Dear Students,

This email message is being sent on behalf of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department.

Recently the campus communicated temporary modifications of policies on P/NP grading that apply to Spring 2020 undergraduate courses, but decisions regarding the courses for major requirements were left to individual programs.

We write to announce that due to the emergency circumstances in Spring 2020, the ECE department will temporarily relax some of its policies for courses taken in Spring quarter 2020. The policies will be modified as follows:

1) Unsuccessful attempts at courses in Spring 2020 will not be counted against the 7-unit limit on non-passing attempts for declaring the Robotics major. The Electrical Engineering major qualification policy already does not include a limit on the number of non-passing grades in major qualification courses.

2) The ECE Department will support one additional attempt beyond the limit of two for an ECE course unsuccessfully attempted in Spring 2020.  This applies to both EE and Robotics majors.

3) In Spring 2020, students in majors sponsored by the ECE Department (Electrical Engineering and Robotics) may take upper division courses for P/NP Grading and use courses in which they receive a grade of P toward major requirements.

Lower division courses (those numbered below 100) used for major requirements must still be taken for a letter grade.

We are maintaining the current letter grade requirement for lower division courses, since the courses used for major qualification must be taken for letter grades to compute the declaration GPA. We want to avoid any confusion about the necessity for letter grades in these courses since it could affect the ability to declare a major. 

Spring 2020 is a challenging time for everyone dealing with the COVID-19 emergency. We are encouraged by the resilience and determination with which UCSC students, staff, and faculty have faced the challenge of conducting remote instruction with little time to prepare, while also often dealing with the personal impact of the pandemic on their families and communities. We understand the challenges that remote instruction poses, including the effects of access to technology and isolation from the campus community. While many students naturally fear that their grades will be affected, we believe that Spring 2020 will always be considered an unusual quarter, with less than stellar performance discounted as an anomaly and the determination to continue in Spring 2020 demonstrating character. Instructors understand the challenges this quarter brings and are interested in ensuring that the learning goals are still reached while providing as much flexibility as possible on assessments. If you encounter a difficulty please be sure to communicate with your instructors.

We also want to remind students that a P grade is only given for C work or better (not C-). The Advising Office has already received petitions from students mistakenly thinking that their C- or D+ grade in Fall and/or Winter courses can be retroactively changed to a P.

Here is some additional information to help you decide between letter grade and P/NP: 

    A grade of “Pass” indicates work was done at the level of a C grade or better.  A ""No Pass” indicates a grade of C- or worse.  


    A “Pass” will satisfy prerequisites for other classes.

    Classes taken P/NP are not counted in calculating your GPA.  Consequently, if you are striving to improve your GPA, you should stick with taking classes for a letter grade and work hard for a good grade. Be sure to utilize the many resources from Learning Support Services to ensure success in your classes.

    Students who are not in good academic standing normally cannot take classes on a P/NP basis. In spring 2020, students who are not in good academic standing may choose to take classes P/NP. Not every student will benefit from this choice, since they may need grades to raise their GPA above 2.0 for academic standing or financial aid reasons. College academic advisers can help you explore this option. 


    Veterans and students in the armed forces may also be affected by the absence of letter grades. Please contact Veterans Services for more information.


    Some medical schools, graduate programs, and professional programs will not accept P/NP for key courses. Please contact your preferred graduate programs' Admissions Representatives for more information on grading requirements in undergraduate courses.


    Students considering changing majors/minors to any that require a minimum GPA in specific courses should be cautious when considering the P/NP grading option in Spring 2020. The permission to choose the P/NP grading option in Spring 2020 as described in this message applies to ECE Department majors only and will not be transferable if you choose to change majors outside of the ECE Department. Please consult the Major/Minor Advisor for any majors/minors you are considering changing to in the future to confirm their department’s grading policy for Spring 2020.


Information on how to change your grading option can be found here:

    Go to the FAQ’s for Students on the UCSC Registrar’s website, select Grading, and click on “How do I change my grading option?”",0.1252923976608187,0.4085282651072125,ucsc
4349,This quarter is NOT worth panicking over,1,2020-05-12 11:30:21,11,"Just gonna share something similar I commented on someone else's post in case it helps you, reader.

Yes, for some of us attending UC Zoom, this quarter isn't too bad. But for **a lot** of us, it is really rough. There's no way you could have had the foresight to see this quarter being as challenging or stressful as it is, so don't kick yourself for not taking a quarter off or taking easier classes. 

If you're having those big struggles, depending on your major (I'm only familiar with BSOE rules), you can switch the classes this quarter to P/NP until Week 9. At worst (NP), it doesn't affect your GPA. At best (P woohoo), the classes counts towards your major/gen ed and you scrape by. If it would be most helpful to drop still, that's *so* okay and a few Ws don't look too bad. Ya boi is bathing in Ws from before transferring to UCSC, and once you graduate, it's all good. But before dropping the class, I recommend instead taking P/NP as well as taking a big, deep breath.

If  you P/NP and end up with three crisp NPs, that's okay! It might take a little longer to get through school, but the situation we're in might require that. I think that's an inevitability for many of us trying to cope with this/next quarter. Plus you cruise through the rest of the quarter giving it your all, and learning what you can tolerate. Giving your best effort to learn what you can is all that can be asked of you. No shame whatsoever.

Get assistance if you're panicking. The insanity of this quarter isn't worth it at all, so if you are worried, please talk to TAs, advisors, and/or counselors. No shame in getting assistance when it could be helpful. At very worst, nobody is helpful and you've lost nothing. But people are understanding, so don't knock it until you try it. I'm happy to help you word a message to TAs, advisors, counselors, etc. for those who want help wording it.

\-Below you will find information on everything SFAC related.

Hello Slugs!

This is a message from the [Student Fee Advisory Committee (SFAC)](https://sfac.ucsc.edu/). The SFAC is an important, influential advisory group that focuses on budget allocations and use of student fees that support various campus services and programs. SFAC serves as the primary avenue for channeling student input into decisions about the allocations of fees, including the Student Services Fee, Student Programs Fee, campus-based fees (referenda), certain Miscellaneous Fees, and the Seismic and Life Safety Fee. SFAC has allocated $700,000 to student programs and organizations for the 2019-2020 year! Please click [here](https://sfac.ucsc.edu/) to learn more. 

**2020 Elections &amp; Referenda**

Basically I had enrolled in a math class when summer enrollment had opened, but thought about it and decided to swap out of it for another one. I attempted to use the swap class button, but it was being wonky and kept trying to swap out the class i wanted to keep. So I just manually dropped the math class and enrolled in my new one. Now, the math class is still stuck on my schedule for some reason, though it does say dropped. I know it shouldn't be a big deal, but I'm just getting worried since I can only take this class once more due to previously failing it, and if this is some system error that counts as another non-pass this would mess things up since I need this for my major. I wanted to confirm that yes, I can drop out of a class with 0 repercussions if the summer hasn't started yet, right? I don't remember the class lingering on my enrollment schedule the last time i swapped a class. Is this also normal? Sorry if this seems like a silly post, but this is kind of bothering me.

I'm an FDM major still living on campus, and I'm thinking of a fun quarantine project. My idea was to record footage of various locations and wildlife on campus, edit it into a video, overlaying some relaxing public domain music (thinking something lo-fi), and uploading it somewhere. This is, again, for fun, and it might help people who aren't on campus currently to see, say, turkeys.

My WIP name for this concept is ""【﻿ＴＵＲＫＥＹ　ＷＡＶＥ】"". Because of course!

However, I am taking requests of what I should seek out and put in such a video. Here are my ideas so far:

\- Turkeys, obviously

\- The Porter Squiggle

\- The hiking trails

\- Porter koi

\- The Farm

\- Maybe oven-roasted allergen-free chicken thigh, for the meme? Will have to figure this one out somehow.

\- Shots of each college

\- Deer

\- OPERS

Anything else? Keep in mind that these have to be things easily recorded in COVID-19 conditions, I'm primarily looking for scenic/wildlife shots, and that I'll have to allow any other laws re: trespassing and such.

Hi everyone, so today I was just admitted off the waitlist to UCSC for the major of Proposed Computer Science : Computer Game Design. My first choice was plain computer science, but got this as my alternate. Right now I have already SIR’d to UC Merced for CSE (Computer Science and Engineering), but I am stuck now because I am presented with this extra option. Could you guys help me decide by answering a few questions?

Some background info about me - Yes I do like to play games, and would love the opportunity to create games as well. This could possibly be the field I want to work in, in the future. But I am afraid that I would pigeonhole myself into only being a game designer and not knowing enough actual “CS stuff.”

1. To start off, what does “proposed major” mean, and when can I declare a major?
2. How is the CS:GD program in comparison to the CS program? Are classes similar? Would taking CS:GD forfeit a lot of CS knowledge, or is it the same amount of CS, but adds on game design courses?
3. Is there a way to switch into CS from CS:GD? If not CS, is CE possible to switch into?
4. In your opinion how good is the CS:GD program, and will it be enough to find a job?What are your opinions on this situation here, go with Merced for CSE or Santa Cruz for Game Design?

And feel free to add anything else you want to say!

4420,Would it be feasible to take courses over the summer and take a gap fall quarter?,1,2020-05-13 20:40:35,9,"So this is going to be a long one, bare with me.

I was thinking about possibly taking courses over the summer at a CC since they're going to be remote regardless, but since UCSC is remote during the summer, it seems as though it would make much more sense to take classes through the UC. Now, my thing is, this seems as if it's a cheaper option than taking classes in Fall Quarter, since summer classes tend to be on the cheaper side, and Fall is very likely to be remote anyways. So pretty much the difference in this situation is cost.

What is holding me back is the idea that I may have my housing revoked because I chose to take a gap Fall quarter, though I'm not sure if that would happen if it turns out to be remote anyways. I plan on contacting housing anyways, but that's just a thought running through my head. 

Along with that, I'm thinking about the fact that I won't get any refunds since I won't be attending Fall quarter. Ideally, I would use those refunds to fill in the gap for summer tuition (which I know I would have already paid- pretty much just covering the cost). So at this point, I'm thinking about possibly attending and doing the bare minimum 12 units just so I would get the refund.

"" Yes, students unable to start during the fall 2020 term due to health issues, military service or COVID-19 restrictions on travel may request to defer their admission to the winter or fall 2021 term. To do so, please visit our [appeals website](https://admissions.ucsc.edu/apply/appeals.html#miscellaneous) and file a Miscellaneous appeal by the established deadline. **Please note: Even if you defer your admission, you will still need to submit your online admission acceptance on my.ucsc.edu by May 1 (freshmen) or June 1 (transfers)**.  ""

Stevenson hosts most of the classes for my major, so it feels like it should be my primary preference.

Just got off the waitlist and recently accepted my admission! Before this, I planned on going to UNR (although that was a cheaper option). I’m still very curious about a lot of things and I was hoping current or future students could give me some insight? I have a few questions:)

1. If anyone is pursuing a Business Management Economics Major, what are your thoughts? 

I heard a few years ago that people looked down on this business major but surely it’s changed after years. I plan on becoming a Financial advisor in the future! Any info/tips/opinions would be nice :)

2. What’s the car situation like? 

I’m from the East Bay and absolutely love to surf. I go to Santa Cruz a lot and I personally think driving around is important. I know that freshmen can’t buy parking permits but are there any ways to get around that? Or maybe off campus parking permits?

3. What’s the dorm situation like? 

I chose Cowell as my first choice and Stevenson as my second. I’ll probably see if I could change to C9/10 since those look nice and new.

4. How’s the party scene?

Im very studious but I love to party all the time. I’m aware greek life is low-key but how are the parties? I was hoping for big loud parties but after reading other people’s messages they seem to be tamed.

I’m also looking for a roommate so message me on Instagram @joshua.heidrich if you want! Would love if you surf or honestly a chill person so hmu",0.1834236900252525,0.49189551767676776,ucsc

I committed to SJSU a few weeks ago for the same major, and since I'm a local I would be staying at home. I checked my UCSC portal yesterday for financial aid, and they're giving me A LOT of grants for this year, to the point where I'd barely have to pay, if anything. 

I pretty much accepted going to SJSU, I'm cool with it, but UCSC was my top school before, and now that I got accepted there and getting a lot of aid, I'm rethinking my decision. However, I've realized that there might not be much to do around there (I go to the area fairly often), and a lot of my good friends are going to SJSU. I know the social scene at UCSC is a lot more laidback compared to SJSU, but I'm more of a mix between being really social and outgoing and laidback at times.

In terms of my major, I know UCSC has more research opportunities, but how does it compare to SJSU? I'm not sure if this matters either, but the median starting salary at SJSU is higher than UCSC which is also admittedly influencing my decision. Which school would be better for my major? In terms of social life/academics (and connections, as I know SJSU has a lot of networking where you could land good jobs/internships being in the heart of Silicon Valley) as well, which one do you guys think I should choose?

4551,UC Berkeley or UCSC,1,2020-05-17 21:15:32,9,"Hi all,

I am a transfer student, getting her BA. I was recently accepted into 5/5 UC's I applied to. I have a lot of options now, and I do not know what to do. Ultimately, my dream would be to get into UC Berkeley's combined M/Ph.D program for Social Work. A master's in social work is the end goal, but if I could get my Ph.D at the same time?!

Anyway, obviously I need to prioritize my GPA, teacher/student ratios and recommendations for that program. 

I was accepted into Berkeley for Global Studies. UCSC for Community Studies, and UCSD I got in for Sociology (of the options I am considering). Because I plan on getting my master's, whether it be at Berkeley or not, my Bachelor's doesn't make too much of a difference as long as its a related field. 

I went to community college, and I took an extra year to figure out what I really wanted to transfer for. If I had known this would be my plan, I would have gone to University of Hawaii like I almost did, and come back home and gotten my MA. I'm looking for my BA to be straight forward. At Berkeley, the Global Studies program is not at impacted as many of their other majors, so I don't think it would be too difficult to maintain a HIGH ? GPA and have room to connect with my professors. 

I decided to let go of the ""college experience"" fantasy a long time ago. I'm not really interested in a beach town college, but someplace close to the city, where I can be involved. Money here is not the issue, I pretty much have my school paid for, and either way I will have to rent. But I find myself daydreaming about going to Berkeley and experiencing that. But it would be cheap (er) to rent in SC for better housing. Also, as they say, UCSC would not be as rigorous as Berkeley. But as I mentioned, I do not believe Global Studies will be as demanding as the way other people have experienced Berkeley. 

TLDR: I'm three years into college, I want simplicity, I want to get my BA done so I can get my MSW/Ph.D. I fear transferring to UCSC because I’d feel like I’m not really “doing anything” as I live here currently and went to Cabrillo Community. Then again, I also got into UCB, and what about experiencing a place as academically rich as Berkeley? If I want to get my M/Ph.D at Berkeley though, should I take an ""easier"" route there, ensuring a high GPA, etc. Or would it not benefit me to get my BA at the same school I want my MA??!

UCSC definitely has a smaller population. But I am told the department for which I am admitted in each is not as impacted as others. So it seems like there's a fair chance to build relationships with faculty everywhere (including Berkeley) Not too sure though.

4554,UCSC or Purdue?,1,2020-05-18 01:13:11,15,"Hey everyone,

I'm a HS senior in the bay area and got into UCSC Robotics and Purdue Exploratory (1 year of regular courses before I apply to transfer into engineering). I've been deliberating/fighting with my parents saying that Purdue is better although I'd have to get very good grades to transfer into engineering, but they are telling me that UCSC is half the cost and close to home and I can always transfer out of UCSC (since I'd be trying to transfer anyways into purdue engineering).

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I can't say no to my parents because they are set on UCSC because they don't trust I'll get the grades to transfer from ""exploratory"" to engineering at Purdue. I am fairly certain that Purdue will be better in the long run, but given my parents pressure basically have to go to UCSC.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously I understand I'm asking a biased audience of UCSC students, but do you have any suggestions?",0.23845238095238092,0.43687728937728937,ucsc

Read the letter we sent to admin!,3,2020-05-19 14:20:22,29,"Those of you against the use of ProctorU, here's a chance to have your voice heard and make a difference. (and those of you who have been here since the Dhar debacle, hi)

&amp;#x200B;

**SEND YOUR TESTIMONY TO SUA**

 I've been in contact with SUA, here's some of the info I've received:

&gt;... the Academic Senate \[which occurred this last Friday\] was interested in hearing specific testimonies from as many students as possible, as professors and others are definitely interested.  
&gt;  
&gt;Academic Senate mentioned that while ProctorU is the approved testing service at the moment, with enough advocacy, it does not have to be. 

Student are encouraged to send testimonies to both [suapres@ucsc.edu](mailto:suapres@ucsc.edu) and  [suavpe@ucsc.edu](mailto:suavpe@ucsc.edu). If you have something to say, here's your chance!

Things to mention:

* Your specific/classwide negative experiences using ProctorU
   * for example, it took my proctors about 90 minutes to start my last exam, and I had to pay a fee to schedule a new appointment because they took so long)
   * for example, our professor couldn't release our scores on a multiple choice canvas exam for over a week because of issues with ProctorU 
* Your individual technology, WiFi, and home circumstances that have/could make ProctorU difficult to use
   * Do you rely on hotspots and tethering? ProctorU bans that. 
   * Do you have a chromebook? ProctorU bans that.
   * Does your home network receive a lot of traffic as a result of family working/learning from home? That compromises your connection.
   * Can you not afford a better device or network?
   * Do you not have total privacy/quiet to take tests and not get flagged as cheating?
   * Are you using a family computer and not have admin privileges or the ability to reserve it for hours at a time?
* Your specific privacy concerns with ProctorU (do you have your DACA files on your device?) However, *don't emphasize this one*. Accessibility is our best case. 

**Remember, you don't have to write much to make a huge difference!** Several of us have already shared our experiences with SUA - we encourage you to do the same!

&amp;#x200B;

**CONSIDER CONTACTING YOUR DEPARTMENT/FACULTY**

We sent a letter to the physics department chair, and after some back and forth, he told us that while he doesn't have the power to break the school's contract with ProctorU, he thinks our concerns are valid and has raised them to 'upper admin'.

I've also been working with one of my professors. She's been helping me navigate the school bureaucracy, spreading our messages and raising our concerns to other faculty and admin, speaking up at the Academic Senate and at faculty meetings, and just generally helping me figure out what to do. 

*Getting faculty support is vital* \- whether its professors or a department chair, it's definitely worth raising your issues and concerns to faculty to raise awareness, gain support, and amplify our voices. The letter we sent to our dep. chair was a near copy of the one we sent to admin, but yours can be far less detailed and lengthy, or even just a message to a professor asking if they're aware of this issue and what students can do to help. *The faculty generally wants to listen and improve things* \- remember that! If faculty is concerned about this, admin has to listen, and we have way more ethos.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONTACTING ADMIN**

We sent a letter to the administration about ProctorU - in it, we pick apart the issues with the privacy policy and raise accessibility concerns. It's full of a lot of info and it's pretty beefy - here it is! \[[LINK TO ADMIN LETTER](https://docdro.id/C8liRTY)\] 

I will update yall as soon as I get a response. If you have any questions about this or ideas about contacting admin, please comment!

&amp;#x200B;

**The Goal**

We're hoping to get the school to leave it's contract with ProctorU this coming fall quarter. To make this happen, we need your voices! Email SUA with your testimony! Reach out to your professors and departments! Inform your classmates!

Our goal is not just to contact Admin - we're trying to raise awareness on this issue, we're trying to gain faculty support, we're trying to amplify student voices. 

As a final note, our best case against ProctorU now seems to be accessibility. As it turns out, it's not actually that good of a service, and a lot of people have significant issues using it. Be sure to emphasize that with any concerns you raise.

**If we're loud, persistent, and polite, we can make this happen.** Thanks for everything thus far, slugs.",0.17515584536371362,0.4381313131313132,ucsc

However, I am still considering reapplying to go to school at USC because it is still a dream of mine and mainly, because my mom’s work is apart of the Tuition Exchange Program, meaning that I would essentially not have to pay for tuition if I was accepted. I’m trying to apply to USC for their film production major for the next school year but the website says they require 48 credits (not including AP credits) before I am even able to apply. So, is it possible to obtain 48 credits in one school year? I’m also planning on taking summer classes at a CC to get additional credit too, as I mentioned in r/UCSC. I would appreciate any feedback or help! Thank you :)",0.22916666666666666,0.48802083333333335,ucsc

There are 3 different multivariable classes at UCSC, and according to the articulation agreement, the one I took gives credit for each of them. Does this mean that I get 15 credits (5 for each of the classes), or do I only get 5 for the class which counts towards my major? I hope it is 15",0.01691919191919191,0.5334595959595959,ucsc

it's like he purposely waits until the last minute, assuming i already completed the assignment because i don't procrastinate like him so he can perhaps just fish out answers from me, which i personally had spent a lot of my time gaining myself. if i don't automatically reply to his texts, he'll call me, perhaps multiple times, when i'm out doing other things and not wanting to pull up my assignment to try to carry him thru it because i already spent a lot of time on it. i find this pretty rude because usually whenever i have to ask help from friends, the first thing i make sure is to ask them if they have time and such, not just randomly bombarding them with my questions.

i feel like it's another story if he started a little earlier and asked me questions as he starts making more progress throughout the assignment. if that was the case, then sure i'm free to discuss and share ideas on it, like i do with my other friend in the same class. but what i feel like he's doing rn is absolutely lazy and entitled. i have even told him to start earlier when assignments are hard, offered to let him work alongside with me whenever i started the hw, but he has not done either.

I just wish this quarter was normal, so that my hard work and studying would be reflected in my grade. But now with the averages so high, our prof's definitely not gonna curve, and I won't be able to get an A. 

I understand that a lot of people are going through stress rn with the pandemic, but I don't think heavy cheating on tests will help anyone. I dont think looking at your notes for a specific enzyme or pathway is bad, but flat out taking it with others is wrong. If you truly are going through a lot of stress, that's why there's the p/np option. I don't think its beneficial to be paying thousands of dollars just to cheat on tests and get a stupid piece of paper. Especially for pre-med students, idk how y'all think cheating through tests will get you anywhere. If my doctor said they cheated on tests in undergrad I'd be a little sus... I get the whole idea of tests not being reflective of what you know.

I already paid $50 to register and I’m going to be so sad if I miss out on taking the classes I wanted to take.

\- I have over 10 commits for that particular lab 

\- I took AP CS in high school and done that specific lab in Java. I have my pseudocode  written in python on [repl.it](https://repl.it) with time stamps on how much I am worked on it. 

\- I have a lot of Piazza contributions and I am one of the top contributors on Piazza. 

\- I have commented on every line of my code and a very detailed pseudocode. If asked I can explain my entire thought process and why I did what. 

After receiving my email my professor asked me whether I worked with this particular person. I had worked with this person on Lab1 and had written their names down on the submission form. For this Lab however I did not work with them. I replied to his email saying that I did not work with them. He responded back to me saying that he is going to file a academic misconduct form and that I will not be able to pass my class. 

After reading through a couple of reddit posts I read that people struck through and went through the process of denying the charges and it took them a couple of months (over 2 quarters). I do not want to go through that process and I am looking for other options. I already changed my grade to a P/NP. I know he is going to give me a NP. I am okay with that. I am willing to take the course again over Fall 2020 and make up the GPA. 

I am worried about what the academic misconduct filled against me is going to do. I was asking around and people have told me usually the provost gives a warning for the first time but I really want to be sure. Because if it is a NP and a warning (which does nothing) I am willing to take it. I really don't want to stress this unfortunate situation for over 2 quarters. 

I have never been in this situation before and I am extremely terrified of what is going to happen, so any kind of help is appreciated.

The problem is that I have been actually doing somewhat fine with all the labs and the quizzes. But because I only got 20/25 on my midterm, which is 20% /25% of my total grade, I have to get perfect on my hardest labs (4&amp;5) and do real good on final to get an A in this class. 

But I because I am planning to transfer as a different major, I really do not want to gamble on “possibly” doing good on all of those and getting an A as getting anything below it will jeopardize GPA by alot( I mean alot)

Thats why I was considering pass no pass since it does not affect my GPA.

Any input will be appreciated!

4876,CSE12 is a Scam,1,2020-05-27 16:59:30,72,"I took CSE12 several quarters ago with an excellent and reasonable professor and got an A.

There are NO prereqs for CSE12. The ONLY way I passed that course with that grade is having taken it with several programming courses behind me.

Every quarter since I've read about the horrors of CSE12.

There are students coming in from high school and trying to take CSE12. Their counselors say its good to go. The lack of prereqs imply its a fairly straight forward class with ZERO prereq knowledge required. It's lower div introductory.

Of course, this is all a lie, as the numbers tell us. Certainly SOME students can indeed take it without issue, but I'd bet most who do have a decent conceptual background in computing to get them through the quarter.

For the numbers to consistently show a high drop rate/fail rate/cheat rate shows the lie the administration continues to push upon newly entering students.

This isn't right. There is a lot of time and money invested by these students into this institution and the administration is making bank of the ignorance and lies they tell incoming freshmen who have to take the class a second time, while simultaneously unreasonably damaging their hopes and dreams.

It's a scam because the prereqs are a lie. The administration knows they're going to screw a large amount of students by letting them access this difficult course early.

1) How is the entrepreneurial culture at UCSC, particularly in the CS community? Do people actively contemplate and pursue potential startup ideas? 

2) How would the workload look like to graduate in under 1.5-2 years provided I have satisfied CMPS 12A,  12, 12L; all math (including CMPE 16, excluding prob &amp; stats) and physics series? 

3) Do the classes fill up rather quickly, particularly for transfer students? 

4) I am an international student, and a CS major. Which clubs/societies would be ideal to establish and develop a diverse social circle? 

5) On campus vs off campus housing? (I do have a car)

6) I don't have any internship or industry experience. what would be the best approach to find internships during the school year, as well as in the summer? More importantly, what platforms do UCSC offer to secure internships, and how effective are these platforms? 

7) Would it be too optimistic to shoot for a 6 figure salary upon graduation in the big 4? What can I do to maximize my odds of tryna secure a job at the leading firms? 

8) I also got into Cal poly and UCI; Cal Poly would be about 3 times more expensive than UCSC cuz of the hefty financial aid I will be getting at both the UCs (UCI and UCSC would cost me about the same). Should I stick with UCSC or does Cal Poly or UCI seem better based on objective analysis of past graduates? I do not have much interest in grad school or research. My goal is to get into the industry.

I'm one of the students who got a flag. I felt super frustrated at first and I can swear to god I didn't cheat. I did not know what will happen and it makes me really upset and stressed.

The reason that I'm here to talk about it is that now Professor Logan told me that I'm all good and I didn't cheat.

I just want to share this with everyone is because I know they're still people suffer from this false flag and they cannot do anything. Also, in my case, it proves that is not all the students got flag is a cheater. I saw too many people saying that all of us are cheaters which makes me upset. 

I also want to say that I personally think that the way professor Logan handling this is not that professional and it makes me suffer a lot, but he is a good person. I just hope he can do it better next time. 

For those people who still fight for themselves, I just want to say that believe yourself. You know that you are innocent and you can prove that. Try to contact your provost but plz do not say something disrespectful things to anyone. That will not help. 

BTW, my highest moss percentage is 29%. If you think I'm cheating, then just believe what you believe.

This will be a remote 10-week program starting in late June/early July and we plan to pay students for their work — either through a stipend or via standard student worker contract. We have an initial proposal due date of June 19. 

Prospective students will be asked to create proposals based on project ideas which have been proposed by our research mentors. Mentors will work with interested students to create a project work plan that compliments the student’s current technical capabilities and knowledge as well as contributes to the work of the open source project. 

We are happy to include additional mentors with project ideas if any other faculty or researcher is interested in having undergraduate research support over the summer. More information on expectation of mentors is available here. Feel free to contact me for more details if you are interested in mentoring or have further questions. 

Please share this announcement with interested undergraduates. CROSS values diversity and inclusion in our projects. We invite students from traditionally underrepresented groups in tech and open source communities in particular to apply to this program.

Interested students should feel free to reach out to me (or the relevant mentors) if they have questions about the program or the application process.

Thank you in advance for your help in reaching out to students about this program

Hello All,

I hope you are well, and look forward to seeing you at 5:20.

Given all that is going on in the country right now, I have heard from other students today that they're experiencing a lot, including a range of emotions and a sense of overwhelm in some cases. Given that, in addition to reflecting on the quarter together, I thought it would be good for us to evaluate what is actually possible in the next ten days, rather than simply proceeding as planned.

Please think about what you've learned this quarter, and what you're planning to turn in, and about the timing for that. We can certainly keep to our original plan, or we can adapt—or some of us can change and/or adapt. This is not meant to be confusing, of course, but to recognize that our circumstances have changed and we have options.

&amp;#x200B;

Final grades haven't come out yet, but I may have failed my last physics class which is a prereq to my major. This will be the first time that I've ever failed a class and I'll still have a 3.6 GPA overall. It's just a bit unforunate because I don't want to spend another whole year at CC just due to one class that I failed to pass.  

&amp;#x200B;

Am I just screwed or is there any course of action that I could take. Do you guys know if I could retake the course this summer at a CC and have my admission be unaffected (assuming that I pass the class). I've also read some other posts about how other students have failed a major prereq class and successfully petitioned to get their admission reinstated, so with all the circumstances that went on this last spring, would that be a possibilty for me as well? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm hoping that the admissions office is a little lenient due to everything that went on this past semester, but ultimately, it's really my fault for taking 5 STEM classes in one semester and not being able to time manage appropriately.

So I’m submitting my SIR tonight &amp; I need help choosing a college affiliation still 

So im a transfer student coming from SoCal/LA county (HMU if u are too lolZ), and I am a neuroscience major. I heard that porter college is where all the transfers go to, and I heard that Crown is where all the STEM majors go to. 

I guess a little bit about my self: 
I’m 22 M &amp; a white washed Filipino LMAO 🇵🇭🇵🇭
I would love to be surrounded by stem majors bc of the common interest. Also I would love to be a part of a program/club that is based around science. 

I heard that Crown college is where the gamers are at LOL I’d say I’m a gamer &amp; I’m totally into the nerd culture. I’m not your stereotypic gamer tho I don’t eat Doritos and Mt. Dew for breakfast lunch and dinner HAHA (no offense)

Other things I’m into include weightlifting or just exercise in general, basketball, &amp; music especially Rap &amp; EDM. Music festivals is my shit (u could be my rave bae or we could go to rolling loud together hehe)

Also obviously looking to have a good social life, I’ll party but not too hard. I’ll drink but not too much, and I’ll smoke but not too mu- actually jk I’m super 420 friendly if u smoke we could totally be friends

I guess my question is where would I fit in the best?? I know porter is for the transfer students but I don’t really know the vibe..

5090,Please Don't Bully Your Professors To Cancel Finals,12,2020-06-02 14:46:30,68,"Hey y'all I just needed to vent about something that happened in my class this morning. There was a conversation going on in zoom chat about how our professor should cancel the final or give everyone A's because of the current world situation. He addressed everything in the beginning of class and said that this was a safe place and everything and he feels bad for the extra stress going on in the world. The people in the chat were saying he wasn't being accommodating and that  this class needed to be more lenient with grading and he should give everyone As or at least pass everyone. I agree that having everyone at least pass is a good solution to this pandemic/riot world stress, they kept saying that he needs to make the class as a whole less weighted. 

Now let me tell you, this class has been amazing during this pandemic. He cancelled one of the projects and makes all the quizzes have two free questions and the final exam has a cheat sheet that we can use to write the essay AND there is a review Thursday to help fill out this sheet. One girl then just decided to call him out and say he has been really unaccommodating and that she hasn't received help on projects and all this. At this point the professor literally turned off his camera and took a minute and then came back to class and stopped lecture for a sec to say that this pandemic isn't easy on the professors either and that the chat needs to be respectful to the people running the class and for those who are trying to pay attention to the lecture. He seemed so sad that he had to literally stop class for this. Like Y'ALL please please please understand that professors/lecturers/TAs are trying hard (except for those few professors who don't give a damn about what's happening). This professor deserved better and has been more than helpful throughout this quarter. This class is very easy to pass.

**TLDR**

* No word yet on housing
* Classes larger than 40 people will be remote
* Core college courses will be remote
* They did leave the door open for a hybrid model where some studens join remotely and others are in the class, but they raise some concerns that this will hurt the experience for those who join remotely (obviously). So it looks like this will require approval by CITL.
* Everything else we'll find out on Friday when we're able to add classes to our shopping carts. If they say the location is ""Remote Instruction"" that will presumably mean that the class is fully online.

Subject: Fall instruction planning update

Deans and Department chairs,  

Thank you for your patience and input as we plan for the fall quarter. Through the information you provided regarding potential delivery methods for the fall curriculum the Recovery and Resiliency Task Forces have reached a planning stage where we can provide initial guidance for fall instruction. &gt;!This planning phase and this message focus solely on fall instruction. Development of guidance for housing and residential life, student affairs and success, and the resumption of in-person research continues in parallel.!&lt;  

 The top priority of the campus is the health and wellbeing of our students, faculty, and staff, as we all work together to maintain the high quality of instruction within the constraints of the pandemic. At the May Regents? meeting, &gt;!President Napolitano announced that UC campuses would all be operating in the fall under a mix of instructional modalities!&lt;. Our campus will offer as much instruction as possible remotely or online and provide in-person instruction where it is pedagogically necessary and can be done in a manner that reduces spread. This prioritizes the wellbeing of our campus community and will ensure the broadest access for our students.  

 **Conditions for Fall Course Instructional Modalities**

 We appreciate the thorough review and communication by departments and colleges of the courses planned for fall and the modes in which they could be delivered. This work, while still in progress, is a vital first step to determining fall instructional delivery. As we approach fall scheduling there are many unknowns; however, we must begin planning and adapt to changing situations as they inevitably arise. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Preliminary scheduling and enrollment for the fall will take the following approach:**

 &gt;!With the possible exception of upper division lab, studio, field study or project capstone courses, any class that course sponsors have indicated can be converted to remote instruction will be scheduled with a location of ""Remote Instruction.""   !&lt;

 &gt;!Courses with class sizes of 40 and higher, regardless of indicated instructional methods, will not be offered in-person. These courses may be offered in a remote format or converted to smaller class(es) sizes. It is important to note that this initial maximum class size of 40 may be reduced as we learn more about the progress of the pandemic and receive public health guidance.  !&lt;

&gt;! Secondary sections, secondary laboratories, and secondary studios will not be offered in-person.  !&lt;

&gt;! The college core courses will not be offered in-person.  !&lt;

 For all courses indicated as needing further consideration to determine whether or not they could be offered remotely, we strongly encourage consideration of all possible options for remote delivery.  

 This guidance is provided for preliminary scheduling and enrollment purposes, and may change as the situation changes.  

**Planning for in-person courses**

 Various campus administrative units will work with faculty, departments, and divisions to determine the capacities for all proposed in-person courses. &gt;!Each in-person course will be evaluated for distancing protocols, room and building capacity constraints, and custodial requirements all within the context of local public health guidelines!&lt;. Plans for specialized courses including labs and studios will be developed with the division overseeing the space in coordination with facilities, Environmental Health &amp; Safety, and Risk and Safety Services. &gt;!Enrollment in in-person classes will be delayed until the second enrollment pass, on July 1.!&lt; This will allow departments time to develop alternatives for offering the course including reducing class capacity, canceling the course, or offering the course later in the academic year.  

&gt;!There is the possibility, due to public health concerns, that instructors will be asked to complete their in-person sessions prior to the Thanksgiving break, following which all instruction and final exams would be remote.!&lt;

 Again, it is important to recognize that we must remain flexible.  &gt;!Plans to teach in-person in fall, regardless of class size, may need to be adjusted or canceled to comply with changing State, County, and UC guidelines, or due to campus assessment of the health and wellbeing of our campus community and/or a need to reduce spread. !&lt; 

 **Consideration of Mixed Modality Courses**  

 Mixed modality within a single course (allowing some students remote access and others in person) should be considered carefully; equity in the learning environment needs to be maintained. It is possible to offer multiple sections of a course (in-person and remote). &gt;!Prior to proposing mixed modality, instructors should consult with CITL regarding potential pedagogical challenges to ensure that the format supports the goals of the course.!&lt; Where mixed instructional modality is proposed, instructors and course sponsors should seek approval from the Committee on Educational Policy, Graduate Council, or Committee on Courses of Instruction to temporarily modify the program or course delivery. Once approved, instructors are encouraged to consult with Online Education to implement the mixed modality format.  

 While our principles and values remain constant - the health and wellbeing of our community, our students? access to the high quality education we provide, and their ability to advance their education in a timely manner, the uncertainties and conditions of the pandemic create elements of stress on those values. To this end,&gt;! the Committee on Educational Policy, Graduate Council, and Committee on Courses of Instruction have encouraged programs to discuss with their faculties the possibility, with Senate committee approval, of temporary modification of degree requirements.!&lt; Such discussions can help ensure that students can make progress toward graduation. I encourage programs to consider the impacts that in-person only courses may have for students who are not able to attend in person. Timely graduation is a campus goal for our students, and the impact of in-person only courses may be particularly burdensome for first-generation, low-income, and international students. I ask that course sponsors consider this in their planning.  

 In closing, I want to again extend my appreciation to the faculty and to departments, colleges, and divisional staff for their quick adaptation to remote instruction, and for the work they will do to continue to deliver quality instruction in the summer and the coming academic year.  

 Sincerely,  

 Lori G. Kletzer  

 Interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor  

 Professor of Economics

His team gave us a working Asgn2 so we can focus on 3. People freaking out about grades and the difficulty during these trying times? Offers extra credit on Asgn3 effectively making it so anyone in the D range now has a legit fighting chance to pass.

5176,"Schedule of Classes available tomorrow, June 5",5,2020-06-04 10:10:02,18," Dear UCSC graduate and undergraduate students:  


The *Fall 2020 Schedule of Classes* (Class Search) will be available tomorrow morning. We have published the Class Search with preliminary information to help you plan for enrollment.  


Given the uncertainty of the pandemic, we anticipate there will be changes prior to enrollment on June 17, as well as throughout the summer. Please be sure to check your shopping cart prior to enrolling, and keep checking your schedule over the summer.  


Online and remote instruction courses

* Online courses will continue to be offered as usual; they will have ""Online"" listed as the location.
* Remote courses (courses that have been identified to be offered through remote means, such as Zoom) have a location of ""Remote Instruction."" For your convenience, we have added a check box in the Class Search to search for online and remote classes only.
* Courses that are offered via remote instruction can be offered either ""synchronously"" (they have set weekly meeting times in the Class Search, and set final exam times), or ""asynchronously"" (do not have set meeting times in the Class Search; students can attend and participate at times that work for them).
* Many secondary discussion sections will not be scheduled by tomorrow's publication, but may have day and time information added before enrollment opens. Be sure to double-check your classes and sections prior to your enrollment to ensure a conflict-free schedule.
* Departments and colleges are still determining the method of instruction; you may see some changes in the coming weeks.

Planning for in-person courses  
**Enrollment in in-person classes will be delayed until Second Pass, on July 1.** Delaying enrollment until the second pass allows departments and colleges time to develop alternatives for offering the course including reducing class capacity, canceling the course, or offering the course later in the academic year.  


We thank you for your continued resilience in these constantly changing times and appreciate your patience as we move forward.

Despite the events of 2018 being a direct consequence of my actions, I feel particularly robbed of this grade as it was an easy A class of which I would've preferred receiving an incomplete or F in rather than the random C grade I got. 

I've read a couple sources that say C's are killers since you need an I, F, or D to retake a class?

Your pronouns would be set by you and appear in a lot of places in Canvas, like Discussion posts, inboxes, comments, etc ([more info](https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-18259-42141184747)).

I think nniccolle is very brave for taking a stand against her own org and also allowing victims to be heard. The UC system has been known to sweep Title IX cases under the rug and I think the past couple of days have shown how broken the system is. 

I've also heard many people wanting to abolish greek orgs altogether and I don't think will solve the issue at all. Even if greek orgs were gone from Santa Cruz, would the parties stop? Would the sexual assault stop?  There's plenty of good ethnic/cultural greek life around, along with good social greek orgs too. Some are doing some great things for their members and for the community and some are professional based. 

I just feel that the issue should more be focused on UCSC and how it constantly failed to take action on Title IX cases. They cared more about their reputation than doing what's right.

Among the people I know at UCSC, it's like half the people I know have no finals anymore. I find this frustating.

I am not begging for a free ride, but the inconsistencies are pretty unfair in my eyes. I respect my professors and appreciate them. I understand that they want to keep the integrity of their classes because they are important to my major. But every professor wants that and so many from UCSC have decided that student well-being comes first in these times. Entire other schools in UC have decided that the integrity this quarters' grades don't matter as much as what is going on. I still respect my professors, so I guess my frustrations lie most with the uni.

1. The way the course was taught this quarter was complete bs, there was NO professor present for the vast majority of the course, and all learning was done through an external tool
2. There are periodic checks of performance through weekly quizzes 
3. We just had a midterm two weeks ago and we have been tested for more than 80% of the course

The class has been an extremely frustrating experience and an example of why some courses should not be taken at UCSC. You could literally have bought the online resource separately for cheaper and had access to more materials (as professor limited some of the resources on the site). 

As an aside, I am someone who has a comfortable grade in the course and have minimal risk taking the exam. But I do think that if any classes are made optional, there should be a discussion about this one.",0.09285714285714285,0.4942857142857142,ucsc

In short, academic misconduct. I got caught using a website with expert answers, that may or may not have been Chegg on an exam. I know, I am stupid. This occurred three weeks ago. I have already received enough emotional dragging so, I ask of none of that here. I messed up, badly, I know it. My record has been clean until this. Pressure, a shitty mental health, and very bad study habits because of online school led to doing this. I’m just scared as to what is going to happen next. I already had a meeting with the professor and I admitted to my faults. I am waiting for the meeting with my provost. I checked the website and apparently cheating on an exam can lead to term suspension. So, I am expecting the worst. I was just wondering if anyone else has been in a position like this and can guide me through what may happen, so I can prepare. I would appreciate anything. If you are not comfortable speaking in the comments, feel free to dm me. Again, I know what I did was stupid and if I could go back, I would go back and never do that again.

I decided to do some more research into the dorms and now think that it might be worth switching my order, but if anyone could give me some other insight into this it would help. I want to be in a pretty social dorm, Where people are down to hang whenever. But I also want to be in an environment to do good my freshman year. I wasn't the biggest partier in high school, but want to try new things in college, but I don't want to join a frat. I like to do active things, I ran xc/track and skateboard. I'm a nerd too. I'm a Robotics major. I'm also a vegetarian and eat a lot. What college do you think would be a best fit?

And some questions: Is it true that Cowell has the oldest dorms on campus (but Stevenson was recently renovated?), but they have the best location and view? And do C10 and C9 have the newest, or best, dorms on campus? Are Stevenson and Cowell both fratty, or is it only Cowell? And are C9&amp;10 less social than Steve&amp;Cow? Does Steve&amp;Cow have an environment where students can succeed still?

So after spring quarter, my GPA is a little lower than what I want it to be. I’ve heard that courses at a CC do not effect my UCSC GPA. So does that mean I have to take courses over the summer through UCSC to get it up? I’d much rather save the money but I don’t see a way around it. Thanks",-0.024999999999999994,0.396875,ucsc

5484,New transfer student advice?,5,2020-06-10 09:29:56,3,"Hi, I was looking to ask a few questions. UCSC is pretty good at not giving you anything to prepare off of, at least thus far.

So I've already done some reading about housing, so I won't ask - but rather to confirm that for the most part the higher ups are leaning towards virtual, with maybe people in arts and such being in person. Yay Comp Sci majors (thats me - at least I intend to choose that as my major, whenever I'm given the option)

But what I was curious about (I've already sent out a few emails, no responses yet) is these things:

* ~~How does the FAFSA work at UCSC? Is it just automatically deducted from the cost of your tuition when you finish up your SARS or whatever its called?~~

Edit: Awayspirit mentioned that this should roll out later on this month, and will be automatically deducted from the cost of tuition - noting that I ought to check in late June anyways, as well as potentially do the math on how much I'd owe to make sure I get my tuition paid.

&amp;#x200B;

* ~~For anyone who's a veteran or child of, how does the CalVet tuition fee waiver work? Same question as above, pretty much, just with a different waiver.~~

Edit: User breezusxx helped me out with this one. Once it's filed, it wipes tuition and student service fees. Messaging the VA guy who's been helping me put my applications together, it looks like its up to the school on whether or not the benefits cover summer tuition (You still have to pay the summer fee though)  


* ~~Ive read up that CSE12 is the boogeyman. What websites can I use to confirm which classes I \*should\* get credit for, so I can know if my AVC assembly courses covers CSE12 for me (it was MASM assembly, for reference)~~

Edit: [Assist.org](https://Assist.org), which I was reminded of by user wayspirit helped me identify what CS courses transfer over.

&amp;#x200B;

* How would I go about registering and planning out the Transfer Edge classes this summer? I know there's only 5 days left to finalize registration, but I would prefer to not take classes I don't need for my major. I don't seem to be able to contact any advisors on this either, which sucks.

4b (tfw professor says the test has 4 questions). In relation to the Transfer Edge classes, how would my FAFSA and CalVet work towards this?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for any and all responses. Please do not pull any japes on me - I'm really struggling with getting all my ducks in a row when the UCSC website is a fat pile of clown vomit.",0.04416666666666667,0.4979629629629629,ucsc

I just completed my 1st academic year at UCSC after transferring. I've taken all required lower-divs for a CS BS, as well as CSE101, CSE107, and CSE183. I'm interested in getting 102 and 103 done, and I'm not sure if taking them during Fall (when we probably are still online, let's be honest) will make them easier or harder, but I gotta get through them eventually. Since I've transferred and not made a plethora of friends in CS, I'm unfamiliar with most professors and class difficulties (though, I know 102 is rough and 103 could be)  
I'm looking for a class recommendation to pair with 102 or 103 (and a GE I'm still figuring out) for Fall. Ideally something that's not going to decimate my life, since whichever of those I pick is likely to do that already. I considered 112 with Mackey who I've heard almost exclusively good things about, but a friend said ""Might be a tough combo"".

Also, I've been getting mixed reviews about the quality of food at the dining halls. Some people say it's disgusting and others say it's great. I know that sometimes it depends on the dining hall but my freshman brain is confused.

I’ve developed a business model that provides a solution to the problems I identified at FAU down in Florida, the university I went for my bachelors. Later, I realized from talking to students from other Universities, that the problem exists in most commuter universities, but the problems differ depending on how the schools handle their parking operations.

A group of friends and I decided to continue with the idea and we are committed to solving the problem by designing a solution focusing on the students, and not on the parking lot administrator. So, to help us build a better solution for the students, we are asking help from students at various universities to answer a few questions about their experience when commuting and parking on campus. We would appreciate your help with this! We are on the way to developing something GREAT for the infrastructure, not only for one university but for all other universities in the United States.

However, with my fall classes telling me they'll go online, I'm now more confused than ever on what to do. As of now, I have two possible choices I can make:

1. **Renew the lease anyways.** This is good because this guarantees we have a place for when school starts having classes/labs in person. However, all of us have said that we will not live there for the fall, and in the worst case if classes are still not in person in the winter, I also won't go back, but my friends said that they plan to anyways. This means there's a possibility of paying for the place for two quarters (not including summer which I also won't use the place for) without even living there myself.
2. **Look for a place starting from winter (or whenever school starts having classes in person).** This is good because we won't be wasting money paying for a place we aren't living in, especially me. However, if we start looking for a place during this time, I feel like everyone will be scrambling to find their own place, and it will be a lot harder to lock down our own place, which could lead to us splitting up. One other bad thing is that there might only be one-year leases (I don't know much about Santa Cruz properties and the different kinds of leases available), and all of us are graduating this coming year and would prefer not to keep paying for a year after we graduate.

There are a couple things I didn't take into consideration, like subleasing or paying month-to-month, but I don't know how either of these things work or how likely they are, and am down for any suggestions.

Of course, my biggest priority is saving my parents' money. I wouldn't want them to pay for a place I'm  not even gonna use. At the same time though, it might be a wiser decision in the long run to keep the place. I'm kinda lost on what to do, so any advice would be much appreciated.

5675,Thanks UCSC. So long everything.,1,2020-06-15 19:32:46,29,"I came in loving the campus and hating the city. I leave loving the campus even more, still hating the city, and vehemently hating the administration.

I graduated yesterday with Honors in my major and I'm surprised as ever.

I want to say that, I cannot appreciate my friends, family, and faculty enough. The last four years of my life easily made college both the happiest and hardest time of my life, and to say that I’ve experienced a substantial amount of “character development” would be a gross understatement.

I entered college incompetent at math and terrified of physics, believing myself to be academically subpar. I had a rough start, failing some classes in the first quarter, and from then on, stressed to declare my major. I doubted if I had what it took to finish college, and until my second year, I often thought if I should switch my major or where I truly wanted to go with my studies and my life. I made many dear friends along the way, and met people from all over the world with all sorts of aspirations. With these friends, I entered my third year, the closest I’d come to suicide. At wit’s end and choosing to drown myself in studies, I tacked on more work believing that I was still inadequate but not yet realizing that I had become more than capable. With my friends and family, I relearned what self-care was and gained closure over my decisions and indecisions. I found my self-worth again, and went on to receive my degree with honors.

I never in my life thought I would do so well in engineering, nor did I imagine myself ever graduating with honors. It never crossed my mind that I would have all the experiences in and out of academics that I had in my four years. There were plenty of mistakes, but plenty of mistakes that I would not give up, for without them, I would not be who I am and where I am today. I’m glad I didn’t kill myself and I’m infinitely grateful for the people around me.

I now move on to take a few gap years in industry, before returning to academia to pursue a PhD. With my efforts, I want to strive to make the world a better place for all.  
Thanks for reading. It’s the end of this volume.

I’ve developed a business model that provides a solution to the problems I identified at FAU down in Florida, the university I went for my bachelors. Later, I realized from talking to students from other Universities, that the problem exists in most commuter universities, but the problems differ depending on how the schools handle their parking operations.

A group of friends and I decided to continue with the idea and we are committed to solving the problem by designing a solution focusing on the students, and not on the parking lot administrator. So, to help us build a better solution for the students, we are asking help from students at various universities to answer a few questions about their experience when commuting and parking on campus. We would appreciate your help with this! We are on the way to developing something GREAT for the infrastructure, not only for one university but for all other universities in the United States.

Please feel free to contact me directly if you have any questions.

At the time of transfer, I'll have most lower-division credits completed.

I could DEFINITELY use the help!!

1) How many students are in upper-division cs classes?

2) What is the format of those classes (individual assignments or group projects), short labs, or quarter-long projects?

3) How much flexibility is there in projects/labs?  Are the instructions specific, or do they leave room for different products?

4) How do you feel about the UCSC quarter system with shorter learning times? Are there multiple quarter projects to make up for this?

5) I heard that CS is majorly impacted. If I register on the day classes open, would I have any issue signing up for first choice classes?

6) Is faculty accessible outside of office hours?  

7) Do any upper-division CS classes involve interaction with students of other disciplines such as the natural sciences?  

8) What part of the cs program do you think could be improved upon?  

9) What part of the cs program do you like most?

10) Would you recommend studying CS here to students transferring from a community college?

11) How easy is it to obtain research experience as an undergraduate CS student?

12) If you have an interest in research not currently pursued at UCSC, what would be a good point of contact to see if it would be possible to start?

13) Anything else I should know about life as a CS student at UCSC?

I am trying to figure out what I should do to satisfy the Entry Level Writing and Composition Requirements for UCSC. There is the AWPE that I could take this saturday, however on the UCSC website, it states that you can also do what is called DSP (Directed Self-Placement), which also says that it is recommended (it is also free compared to the AWPE's $120 fee). The DSP is to be done during the second course of orientation on July 2. However, I believe that this is the first year that they are doing this, and they have not released any information about it yet. Does anyone know any differences between them and which is posssibly the better one to take? I need to make a decision soon because the AWPE is this Saturday (unless they have makeup testing dates).

I am a research assistant at Farmingdale State College working on understanding COVID’s impact on the online learning experience for 2nd to final year college students. I am currently conducting a short questionnaire on this topic and I'm looking for college students to take it. This is a follow up questionnaire but feel free to take this one even if you didn’t do the previous one. I am really looking to capture the experience and difficulties students have had with online learning. Also, sending it to any students who relate to this topic would be a great help.

Please do not refer to Berkeley as ""UCB."" This is not the proper way to refer to the University of California's original and flagship campus. Cal, Berkeley or UC Berkeley are all proper and acceptable ways to say it. UCB, on the other hand, is not.

As the system's most prestigious and respected campus, we feel that it is important to honor and maintain an appropriate level of respect for our university's name. We feel that ""UCB"" cheapens our brand and doesn't emphasize the incredible prestige associated with Berkeley.

While it may be acceptable to refer to all other UC campuses in initialisms due to their lack of recognition and prestige, this is not acceptable for the flagship and most well-known campus, and we therefore request that you cease using the name ""UCB"" to refer our school. Thank you.

TL:DR

Don't say ""UCB"" when referring to Berkeley.",0.19999999999999998,0.5160714285714286,ucsc

1. Live at home with my parents: which is the smartest option financially, but I really, REALLY don't want to spend my whole second year under my parents' roof.
2. Find an apartment in my home town: Which is cheaper than Santa Cruz by a long shot, so cost wouldn't be an issue here. However, I still don't know what is going to happen next year in terms of housing, so I could end up just living there for a few months, or a full year. Plus, I already have possible roommates lined up, so finding others to split the cost with won't be difficult.
3. Find housing in Santa Cruz: Which is expensive, but would be the smartest choice if I'm looking into the future because I would have a place to live in Santa Cruz for the next three years. The only problems are that I don't have anyone that would definitely want to move down there and share housing with at this time, and I can't afford a place by myself.

Please help me make this decision! And if anyone would be interested in the third option, let me know!",-0.014876033057851245,0.3660353535353535,ucsc

I’m offering one-on-one math tutoring via zoom for all summer session math classes this summer.

I aim to provide a tutoring experience in which you are the one doing the work and making new discoveries. My tutoring style is very hands-off. I will encourage you to be the scribe during the session and I tend to use lots of Socratic questioning to get your gears turning and engage your problem solving skills. That being said, I’m flexible in my tutoring style, recognize that not everyone learns in the same way, and am open to trying different approaches.

As for my qualifications, I graduated from UCSC last quarter (Spring 2020) with a BA in pure mathematics, and with an A in each of my upper division math classes (definitely because of the curve in some cases haha). I have ample tutoring experience both formal and informal. I have worked as a small group tutor and individual tutor for Learning Support Services (LSS) on-campus as well as a math instructor for private tutoring centers off-campus. Additionally, I’ll be attending graduate school at UCSC this fall.

Please do not refer to University of California, Davis as ""UCB."" This is not the proper way to refer to the University of California's flattest and most cow populated campus. Cow Town, UC Danny DeVito, or UCDDV are all proper and acceptable ways to say it.  UCD, on the other hand, is not. 

As the Danny Devito's (maybe) favorite campus, Cow Town students feel that it is important to honor and maintain an appropriate level of respect for our university's name. We feel that ""UCD"" cheapens our brand and doesn't emphasize the incredible prestige associated with UCDDV.

Hello everyone,

I am a college student and I know the feeling that high schoolers get when they are seniors. High school seniors feel overwhelmed and anxious about the college process. From deciding what schools to apply, starting the applications, and deciding what school to go to. I always wanted to start a mentorship program to help seniors through that process. My goal and plan is to create College Bound Mentorship and help around 50 seniors by pairing them up with a college student. The pairing will allow seniors to start connections with college students as well as to have someone who they will be able to  seek when they have questions. I know that my idea is still up in the air but It  wouldn't  be possible  to start it if I do not have Mentors to help out. Please fill out this google form if you are interested in helping out.

Thanks!

If you’ve met with a peer coach in the past week for enrollment help please fill out [this quick survey about your experience](https://forms.gle/NsZkRZ6PXvR2y9Rr7) 

The zoom environment is set-up so that you will enter into a waiting room, and peer coaches will offer one-on-one assistance on a first-come, first-served basis. At any time, there will be between three and five peer coaches available at a time to help students.

Peer Coaches are well equipped to help students with the following:
-Choosing classes and building a schedule for fall quarter (GE's, electives, showing students how to identify major qual criteria via online resources)
-Navigating the class search
-Assisting students with enrollment via MyUCSC (add, drop, swap, edit, validate cart)
-Troubleshooting basic enrollment issues (identifying causes of error messages, resolving basic time conflicts, etc.)
-Helping students access and use their Academic Advisement Report (AAR) to identify needed requirements

Peer Coaches are NOT equipped to help students with the following, and will refer to the appropriate resources:
-Resolving enrollment holds
-Academic planning beyond scope of fall 2020 enrollment
-Selecting classes/advising students on upper division major requirements
-Resolving complicated enrollment issues that need the expertise of academic advisers or support from the Registrar's Office (triple-takes; enrollment over-rides, credit extensions etc.)

Does this seem like a reasonable approach or would that be inappropriate? If it makes any difference I was a CS major, so I would be asking one of the undergrad CS profs.

It's a vector calculus course (Math 23A equivalent at UCSC) and I'm on the borderline of passing. I don't feel overly confident about how I did on the final. It is not a foundation course for transfer but it is a recommended course for transferring in. UCSC's policy for transfer is that you can't get less than a C in any class before transfer. We are given an extended drop date of today to drop the course and take a W due to COVID-19. Should I drop the course and explain to UCSC why I did it? If so, even if it wasn't a foundation course, will they hold it against me since it is something required eventually for the major and was called out as a recommended course? Or should I just risk it and hope for the best on passing? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",0.15333333333333335,0.36750000000000005,ucsc

I posted here a few days ago about potentially  starting a program called College bound Mentorship.

Through the days it seems like this program will be possible, we have gotten some mentors and even people interested in being board members. If you are interested feel free to fill out this form.

6224,Here's why you should still avoid Hilltop Apartments,28,2020-06-30 11:00:56,28,"Hilltop Apartments is a hot topic around here. I know a lot of people who live at Hilltop and a lot of people who used to love at Hilltop. Which makes sense, because it's a fairly large apartment complex and given the housing problems in Santa Cruz, it's inevitable that people will live here regardless of how bad it's reputation is.

I'm writing this because I want to emphasize how bad it is there. 

---

##Construction

The first thing is the construction, which dragged on for months. I honestly don't have that much of an issue with construction. I get up early on school days anyways, and the few times there was noise at night I can excuse. And the construction is mostly over now. 

The problem with the construction was the lack of any notice whatsoever for some things. For example - one day we woke up to see they were tearing down our balcony. To give them some credit, now that the balcony is finished, it looks fantastic - but we were given no warning that it was even going to be torn down! 

The other problem is the mess that comes with construction. Dust everywhere is to be expected, just because it gets in the air and settles naturally, and it's impossible to avoid this. But Hilltop took this to another level. Somehow, paint chips and other debris made it through closed windows and closed screen doors. The balcony door was *definitely* closed - there was no more balcony to even go to - but massive amounts of debris still got through. 

And a one more story to add about construction. [Here's a picture](https://i.imgur.com/fRH9XA0.jpg) of where they drilled into the side of our apartment. I think they were trying to install siding or roofing and missed somehow? But if you've ever used a drill bit to make a hole before, you know that the thing you drill in doesn't cease to exist - the stuff that used to be there comes flying out. This came with a side dish of debris on all our stuff. 

---

##Laundry

Laundry might not sound like an issue to you. It didn't sound like an issue to me, after all what could be worse than then on campus laundry rooms? 

Hilltop. That's what could be worse. It's basically a bigger on campus laundry room but with less maintenence. 

It's definitely fair for the school to charge us $1 to wash + $0.75 to dry. It costs money to use water and electricity, and by charging us per use instead of bundling it in our housing costs, they make sure you do a reasonable number of loads. 

So it's fair for Hilltop to charge as well, right? But wait - they charge $3 to wash + $2.50 to dry. And at UCSC, if a machine is broken, they have the courtesy to unplug it, and if there's a leak the maintenance mops it up within a reasonable amount of time. (Side note, bless the maintenence at UCSC.) But at Hilltop, they'll just let water run out on the floor for a while. And if a machine is broken, they'll just leave it broken and plugged in. If you put laundry in it, the machine will still eat your money but not properly wash your clothes. 

---

##Fake Reviews

Look up Hilltop and look at the reviews. Whatever site you go on, there are probably a few people like me who say ""avoid it at all costs, they made my life a living hell"". Then there's a bunch of people with weirdly positive comments that focus on things like ""they allow pets!"" and ""the view!"". (The view is average at best for Santa Cruz, let's be honest.) I'm sure some of these might be legitimate, but the fact that fake reviews exist should tell you enough about the place. 

---
 
##Other Things

Here's a few more reasons you might want to avoid Hilltop that aren't the management's fault. 

Location: If you live at Hilltop you'll be on the 20 route, which means you need to take the 20D/20/22 to campus. When not on COVID schedule, this means that the earliest bus to campus and to get downtown is around 7:20 am. The bigger issue is the late night and weekend schedule. If you have a late night class, there's a decent chance you could be waiting 45 minutes to an hour for a bus. And if you need to get anywhere on the weekends, the first bus doesn't leave until noon and the bus going down from campus is often close to full. 

Break-ins: There were a few incidents where cars parked on Western Drive were broken into. Not a huge issue since Hilltop has parking, just be wary in case you were planning on using street parking often. 

---

I understand that for a lot of people, Hilltop may be your only option. The housing crisis affects us all differently, and you might not have the opportunity to rent elsewhere. 

I also realize that I might sound crazy, or I'm just complaining to complain. I saw some people with negative opinions of Hilltop, and my roommates convinced me that they were just complaining to complain, and I accepted that mostly because it was so late and I had no other options. 

I firmly believe that Hilltop is one of the worst possible options in Santa Cruz. The new management might change some things but the fact that they care about renewals and new leases more than anything else remains. 


TLDR: The ""hill"" that they refer to in Hilltop Apartments is the pile of money they make from students.",-0.0023423151974288296,0.5150182834841925,ucsc

I don't know who to call to ask about this information, and the information UCSC has put out seems a bit vague. Let me know if you can answer any of these:

Is there on campus housing of any kind for the fall quarter? Is it limited or restricted completely?

Are any classes being offered in person? I'm enrolled for two courses with labs, both of which appear to be online. Is this the case with all lab classes or just the ones I happen to be enrolled in?

What are online labs like?

Has anyone decided to take a LOA until this situation is over? Are you guys happier with online courses from home or do you feel like it's not fair to pay the same tuition?

Is the campus reopening contingent on the making of a vaccine, and will the vaccine be mandatory for coming to campus again once it's out? I don't think I'd mind getting it, but it seems like that's what health officials are making the baseline for when things can return to normal.

Hi! I’m a second year (going into my third year) at UCSD and have not been able to declare into the Physics major so I’m looking at transferring into Physics at UCSC in the winter. At UCSD we have the PHYS 4 series (physics majors) and PHYS 2 series (physics/engineering/chem majors). I have a 3.7 GPA in the PHYS 2 series classes (+labs) and a pretty crappy cumulative GPA of a 3.18. I was wondering if anyone was able to get into Physics at UCSC using the PHYS 6 series instead of the PHYS 5 series? Though, it seems like the Physics 2 series is actually comparable to the 5 series. I have currently tried to reach out to Physics advising, but I’m not sure if they’ll get back to me since I’m not currently a student there.

Also, if anyone has transferred into the Physics department at UCSC, what has your experience been? Thank you!",0.09659090909090909,0.4126262626262627,ucsc

The back of the house runs parallel to a creek, and the room I am subletting has a fantastic view of all the greenery. My room is also located on the second floor on the backside of the house, so there plenty of privacy.

6273,Rocket notebooks are a lifesaver for UC Zoom,1,2020-07-02 10:22:02,16,"I don't know if anyone has heard of Rocketbooks but I actually found out about them through this subreddit. They're a reusable notebook that you write in using Frixion erasable pens (I use refillable ones), and you use an app on your phone to scan the page and automatically upload it to Google Drive, Dropbox, whatever accounts you link the app to. There's actually little symbols on each page that you fill in and you link each symbol to an account or subfolder in a cloud drive. And then once you're done you just wipe the page clean with a damp rag.


The only downside is that the pen takes about 10-15 seconds to dry. So if you're left handed unfortunately you might be smudging the pen all over the place.


I thought this might be a nice option for those of you that can't afford an iPad (these are around $25 IIRC), or like to do handwritten notes but don't like wasting paper (especially now that we're just uploading stuff on Canvas anyways). It's wayyy more seamless than using clunky PDF scanner apps that have ads and stuff,  and once you get the one notebook you're set forever. Personally I was going through three paper notebooks per quarter and it was such a waste of money and paper!

If all marks are going to be curved like this, maybe he should adjust the grade cutoffs (eg make 80% an A-, 70% a B-, 60 a C-, as is the case in many Canadian systems) to make it a little more forgiving.

6398,International peeps,1,2020-07-07 21:23:26,6,"So I am not a n international student nor do I know what UCSC's plan is but I was thinking that this can be done: 

UCIS said international students can only take 1 class online, so my first option was record classes and play them on a projector in a lecture hall with social distancing. This allows the prof. to stay at home and teach as well as circumvent the cap of online classes that a student can take (which is only one). All you'd need is a designated student to turn on a recording for a set of 10 people at a time and have 30 different slots for a session during the week for students to go classes. 

this works as a way to have live sessions but still allows a prof to work from home and allow a student to stay socially distanced.

All the F1 students GOOD LUCK! Stay safe, I'm gonna be an international student in a few years and scares me how supportive the US government is to students who want to learn are =)",0.1752020202020202,0.45111111111111113,ucsc

6404,A suggestion I hope reaches professor and admins regarding current ICE situation and int students,1,2020-07-08 01:20:34,0,"Due to the recent restriction by ICE, international students will be deported since online classes will not qualify them for a visa. This means many of them would have to go home, which usually wouldn't be a problem. But during COVID, direct flights to any country are impossible and coming back to the U.S. requires months of getting your request processed. Because traveling is a high-risk endeavor at this time, there is also the possibility of them catching COVID during the flight and infecting their family/neighbors back home. Instead of exposing international students to this danger, UC Admin should expand in-person class enrollment so that international students can enroll in these classes P/NP. They should also be allowed to fail the class with no penalty to remain in the U.S. This way, counselors can recommend these classes to prevent international students at risk of deportation from dropping out and save lives that would’ve been affected by mass traveling.",-0.024404761904761905,0.2839285714285714,ucsc
6405,UCSC Walking Back Housing Priority for Returning Sophomores ??,1,2020-07-08 03:33:14,7,"Various sources have previously reported that UCSC would attempt to give returning sophomores with housing guarantees priority for on-campus housing.   

&gt;""We ask that all first-year students consider postponing their move onto campus until we are able to accommodate a higher density in housing,"" said Scott Hernandez-Jason, director of News and Media Relations (June 17).

Yesterday's housing update seems to walk this back, and signal that some or all freshman will be given priority, with only some sophomores allowed.

&gt;To allow us to significantly reduce our overall housing capacity and focus on a smaller on-campus population, all student rooms will be assigned as singles or doubles (no triples or quads).   Residence halls will be primarily single-occupancy rooms, while campus apartments may have a combination of single and double-occupancy bedrooms. ... **Priority for housing placement will be given to** *various* continuing UCSC student *populations*, **new first-year** and new transfer students affiliated with the Renaissance Scholar program, and other new transfer students.

Of course, this was all prefaced with some universal weasel words:

&gt;The campus is following health and safety guidelines ***while working toward making critical decisions*** for the coming academic year, including what impacts this crisis will have on our university housing and dining operations. 

(*Good of you to be ""working toward"" making decisions;  will you be letting us know something before September?*)

**==&gt;   Has anyone actually received a housing contract or binding commitment?**   (As opposed to vague ""fill in some more requests and forms, and we'll get back to you soon""?)",0.09696137196137194,0.41229187479187474,ucsc

So I looked at last years published rates with Wayback machine. (By this, I mean I looked at the website as it was on March 7th 2020, when it had the rates published from last year.).

How can they try to make it seem like they’re discounting us, when in reality they just jacked up the price and then discounted that.

6449,How bad does your situation have to be to qualify for the Renaissance Scholars Program?,1,2020-07-09 12:26:23,7,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

So I've been going back and forth for a few months trying to figure out whether or not I should apply for the Renaissance Scholars program. I current live with my father, he has a habit of whenever he gets angry or stressed to take out that anger on me by means of yelling and bullying. I've had this all of my life and it has lead to me having multiple developmental problems such as cptsd and etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

That being said when he's not angry or stressed he definitely tries to be a good father. He tries to be involved, tries to help me with my problems, tries to be a good parent. The bad times however make me strongly prefer to not live with him though, and I am able to still live with him for a majority of the time without any significant problems.

&amp;#x200B;

This leads conflicted about applying to the renaissance scholars program as I don't need the services provided (ie housing) but I do desperately want them. I'd feel bad taking these resources from someone who does need them. Also I'd feel very conflicted since my father is still supporting me, whilst I'd be in a program for people who's parents don't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is how bad does your situation have to be to qualify for the renaissance program and based off the info I've provided do you guys think this program is meant for me? Also if anyone has any experience in general with the program I'd love to hear your thought and opinions as well.",-0.012040043290043276,0.5136904761904763,ucsc

2) additonally,  under the meeting times for my core course, it apparently states they meet TuTh 1:30PM-3:05PM AND Th 7:10PM-8:45PM. it's basically implying that lectures happen twice on thursday, right?

3) while i'm interested in enrolling in math 11A because it's ""easier,"" math 19A really seems to work best with my schedule as it's asynchronous. also heard the professors for math 19A are better, but hm what do yall say? also i noticed under math 19A they stated enrollment wasn't necessary? i'm unsure what they mean by that.

6514,Incoming Freshman (Computer Engineering) - Looking for Advice with Enrollment,1,2020-07-11 18:10:13,16,"As the title says, I'm an incoming freshman this quarter for computer engineering and I'm having trouble figuring out which courses to take. For this quarter, I understand that I'm supposed to take a core course, a math course, and a programming course (based off the plan they have on the website). I scored high enough on the math placement to enroll in Math 19A, but I'm worried about not doing so well as it has been awhile since I did actual calculus, yet I think it'd be better to take it over Math 3. I'm mainly concerned about which programming course to take. I took AP CS A this past year, so I was thinking CSE 30, but I've yet to get my AP score. My score comes the day AFTER the deadline for signing up for the CSE 30 placement test, so once again I'm a little stuck. Based off the horror stories here, I don't think it'd be a good idea for me to start with CSE 12, and CSE 20 is more of an introduction from what I know which I feel like I've done enough of in AP CS A.

However, I searched up classes just now, and CSE 20 and 30 are both full! The only open class is CSE 12. I'm a bit confused as to how there's no space already when enrollment for freshman doesn't start until the end of this month. Are more classes going to show up later?? Can someone please guide me through this? Any help is appreciated. Thank you!",0.12092592592592594,0.4374074074074074,ucsc

Here's where I'm torn: currently it says Math 21 is full for fall, so I'm left with AM10, which I have heard is better for engineering(?) and less mathy math (?). BUT, I have also heard that the AM10 fall professor is not great (Abram Rodgers) and the winter quarter professor is a lot better (Brummell).

1. Is my info accurate about the professors, course stuff?
2. Would it be better to wait until winter quarter to take AM10 with a better professor and just not take a math course fall quarter?
3. As a freshman, I think I am last to enroll in courses (completely unsure, although a lot of courses are filled already so definitely not first to enroll) so if I wait for winter quarter, will AM10 fill up too quickly and leave me at a loss once again?
4. Any other professors I should actively avoid or try to get?

Hell its better to bike for 15 min than walk for 20-30.

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing that bike theft is rampant in university campuses, I bought a kryptonite series 4 evolution New York noose([https://www.amazon.com/Kryptonite-York-Noose-Bicycle-Chain/dp/B001JPQ0HC](https://www.amazon.com/Kryptonite-York-Noose-Bicycle-Chain/dp/B001JPQ0HC)) knowing that that is the best option to prevent my wheels and frame from getting stolen.

My questions are:

* How ""Biker friendly"" is UCSC?
   * Are there sufficient bike lanes?
   * Are there a good amount of bike cages or places to lock?
   * Are the bike racks overcrowded or ok?
* How bad does the uphill get from Oakes to Baskin Engineering?
* How bad is the bike theft situation?
   * I'm sure that chain and mini u lock will do the trick, I use an old crappy cable lock to lock down my seat and helmet

## [Petition Regarding Parking Enforcement and Students in Labs](https://undergrad.soe.ucsc.edu/petition-regarding-parking-enforcement-and-students-labs)

&gt;We have some new information about parking permits, based on several conversations that Karen Ottemann and Marm Kilpatrick had with TAPS and EVC Kletzer. The campus is not going to change their decision about charging for parking. They are, however, making funds available to undergrad and grad students through Slug Support to help with the cost of parking.  
&gt;  
&gt;To quote EVC Kletzer  
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; As many of you know, Slug Support ([https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/slug-support/program/index.html](https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/slug-support/program/index.html)) is a program in our Dean of Students office that is designed to support students, graduate and undergraduate, with the many financial challenges of living in Santa Cruz and going to school. As an existing program attuned to student needs, Slug Support will provide financial support to your students as they manage parking costs this summer. I have talked with Garrett Naiman, Dean of Students, and he is committed to assisting your students. One benefit of directing students to Slug Support is the opportunity for them to work with advisers on other financial hardships, such as food and rent.  
&gt;  
&gt;We also want to keep track of students experiences with the bus and Slug Support so that we can help if needed, so have started this google form.

This is the first time in a few years where I am without an academic plan, so everything is a bit overwhelming at the moment when it comes to selecting my courses.

So far this is what I know:

\- I have used assist.org to see what is required for my degree, it helps but I get a bit lost when I encounter a section of courses that didn't have a corresponding course from my community college. I assume I will require all these classes?

\- The counselors will take a look at my unofficial transcript and will have some sort of ed plan or recommended courses that I should take. I can expect to hear from them during the week of July 27th.

\- I can now plan my schedule and back up schedule, the portal was open last week I believe.Â 

Things I am unsure about:

\- Which credits will transfer over from my CC? I was told not all my credits will transfer over and I would be choosing which ones will and which ones won't. Is this true? Will I need to retake some courses I already took at CC to fulfill requirements for my degree?

\- Is Physics still required for CS? I was told no. I have only taken the equivalent of Physics 5A at CC

What I really want to know is what I can do to prepare my possible Fall '20 schedules RIGHT NOW. Should I wait until my counselor contacts me? Or can I schedule to speak with them ahead of time? Should I just figure this shit out on my own?Â",0.09183673469387756,0.513265306122449,ucsc

I'm not adverse to taking Writing 1, I just want to see what it's like beyond the basic course description. The main things putting me off from just deciding to take Writing 2 are the ""fast-paced"" aspect of the course description and the research, but I'm slow/distractible as heck in every subject (looking into getting help for that), so I'm not sure how that would affect my writing placement.

I guess I'm looking for some words from people who have gone through this to alleviate my stress of not being granted financial aid my last year, as they did indicate that they only do it for certain circumstances. I heavily depend on financial aid as I do not get any help from my family, so I'm just worried that, if I do not get financial aid, I may have to drop out.

This spring I applied for and got several jobs. One is multi-quarter and the other two are orientation leader jobs, and I'm hearing back from a multi quarter research position this week. 

The research position (although it hasn't been offered to me yet) is extremely relevant to my major. Since I'm slightly younger, this position would give me experience + research to show to other jobs in the future. The other multi-quarter job, without going into detail, is with the Career Center and I would get valuable professional experience, like working with resumes, finding internships, making connections, etc. So I don't really want to give up one job for the other, as you can see.

I know that student employee are allowed a max of 20 hours per week, but my supervisor mentioned offhand that she thinks there's a way to petition for more working hours? Does anyone have any experience or tips for this?? And if there isn't any petition or anything, (I know this sounds crazy) do you think it would be alright to ask one of these positions to just not pay me?",0.004166666666666674,0.32166666666666666,ucsc

I am trying to get stuff done this summer. I have a job and I'd like to work on some side projects to learn and develop more/better skills. But my problem is that if I don't have a grade for a class or a boss holding me accountable, then I don't do what I would like to.

I've read some articles and things like that to try to get a better idea of how to fix this but nothing seems to work. I am motivated and excited to work on some my personal projects, but I struggle keeping that motivation up and executing my ideas after a day or two.

Some of the things I'd like to do in my day include developing (programming), reading, and watching webcasts/YouTube to learn/keep material fresh in my head to apply to my projects... really just anything to keep learn something that I am interested in. But my problem is that there is nothing forcing me to stick to a schedule and/or buckle down and do these activities.

I'd like to fix this (and my sleep schedule) to be as productive as possible, while making and doing things I like, but I no longer have any idea on how to keep myself accountable to myself when I don't have a grade or a boss hanging over my head.

What are some ways I can keep myself from deviating from my plans for the day to accomplish my personal and professional goals for the summer?

6766,PSA from someone who was quarantined in a hotel,211,2020-07-22 03:58:05,20,"Ok I tried posting this yesterday but for some reason the mods flagged it and wouldn’t post it, idk why, hopefully this goes through. 

Basically I graduated this past June but about 2 weeks before the end of the year I got incredibly sick and was quarantined in a hotel by the school for probable-COVID. It turned out to likely be Adenovirus but since I was treated as if I had COVID for about a week, I thought I’d post info about it since I know it’s gonna happen to those of you moving to campus for fall. I was terrified to go to the health center because the website said there were no active cases on campus and I was scared to be the first case, so hopefully this will help ease anxiety for anyone who inevitably gets infected. I’m not a health professional obviously but this is what the health center had me do, of course do your own research and contact your own doctor with questions.

Basically, everyone moving to campus should stock up on asparin and tylonel. Just buy it now so if you get sick, you don’t end up infecting a store. The tylonel will keep your fever down and the asparin will thin your blood, cuz some people with COVID end up supposedly getting blood clots. If you get sick on a Friday, like I did, and the health center is closed all weekend, these two things will be a life saver. 

Also I would buy 500mg vitamin C and 10-20mg zinc and take those as a precautionary measure. Higher zinc can lead to zinc poisoning so don’t buy a higher amount. 

Also just a life pro-tip, if you have trouble breathing lay on your stomach and lean forward when you’re sitting, your lungs are towards your back so when you lean forward they can expand more fully. I think I spent all week like this lol. They also had me do breathing exercises like breathing in for 5 seconds, holding it for 5 seconds, breathing out for 5 seconds, and then do that 3 times, and right after breathing out for the last 5 seconds cough really hard. Idk why that helped but it did. 

Basically, if you have enough symptoms (honestly I wonder if my test was a false negative, cuz I had a high fever, cough, trouble breathing, exhaustion, and loss of taste, and extreme nausea/vomiting) they will make you go home and pack pajamas, and transfer you in an ambulance to a hotel. Your housemates typically have to quarantine in the dorm/appt until your test results come back, and slug support will buy them free groceries through Instacart, so honestly my roommates were kinda psyched about the free food.  

The ambulance was embarrassing but they were super nice and honestly I was too out of it to really care. Then I was taken to a best western out in town and told to go through a back entrance to the third floor which was sectioned off to only be for quarantined UCSC students. Idk if anyone else was there though because you can’t leave your room under threat of student conduct violation. You also get free groceries through slug support/Instacart, and the school pays for the ambulance and hotel. I think you’re allowed to get the hotel breakfast sent up to you in the mornings but honestly I never woke up in time. 

There’s a quarantine coordinator that texts you every morning and night and delivers medicine to you from the health center. For example, one morning I woke up almost completely unable to breath so I called the health center to speak to the same doctor who tested me, she prescribed an inhaler, and then the quarantine coordinator delivered it. Honestly he was a little slow which was incredibly annoying cuz I had to wait like 5 hours to be able to breath correctly, so yeah if you need something don’t procrastinate asking. 

I recommend just buying CruzCare now, so you don’t have to deal with the paperwork when you’re sick. The only thing it won’t cover is prescriptions, I think in total I was prescribed/sent vitamin C, zinc, anti-nausea meds, the inhaler, more asparin, more tylonel, naproxen, benedryl (to sleep after so many nights up puking), an antacid, and cough lozenges, and it came out to like $200 charged to my student ebill account. So if you can, I reccomend having around that much in the bank saved for a possible eventual quarantine. 

So yeah, I hope this helps anyone in the future who might get infected. I was honestly so scared to get tested because even though I was the sickest I’ve ever been in my life (like, “laying in a cold bath on my stomach so I can breath &amp; keep my fever down while staring at the wall in shock for 3 hours and vomiting into a bucket” type sick), I was worried the school would be mad at me for being the “first” case (tbh i think the website counter is inaccurate anyway), I was scared they would make my roommates move again or something, I was scared I’d be charged for the ambulance and hotel etc. But everyone was extremelyyy nice and helpful.

6794,Tips for planning and enrollment for new BSOE students,26,2020-07-22 23:19:23,7,"TL/DR: please read it. Useful links and tips for finding classes and enrolling.

Use this link to figure out what classes you need to take: [Cirriculum Charts](https://undergrad.soe.ucsc.edu/curriculum-charts).

Then use this link to look up the class on the catalog for a course description and list of prerequisites: [General Catalog](https://catalog.ucsc.edu/en/Current/General-Catalog/Courses).

Then use this link to see if and when it's offered: [Schedule of Classes](https://courses.soe.ucsc.edu/courses/cse).

Then when you decide on some classes you'd like to take for the quarter and have a plan, make a few back up plans in case some classes get full and add them to your cart and enroll when your appointment time comes.

If you see any department that is abbreviated as: cmps, cmpe, ams, ee, or tim, know that those are the old department names. The school of engineering went under some reshaping. So classes with the old department names are either cancelled (never being offered again) or renamed (still offered, but different name) because some departments split up and some merged.

Use this link to check how things were renumbered from the old to the new numbers and department names: [BSOE Course Renumbering](https://undergrad.soe.ucsc.edu/bsoe-course-renumbering).

I recommend bookmarking all those links. I use them allll the time. If you are concerned about a class combination/workload or professor, please search this sub (with the new and old class names and look for people who posted explaining a similar situation as yours) and rate my professors (caution, take with grain of salt, RMP has a fair amount of bias) for more info.

If I missed anything or you want specific info for your situation, see these links [BSOE Peer Advisors Info](https://undergrad.soe.ucsc.edu/peer-advisors) (still available in summer) and [BSOE Advising FAQs](https://undergrad.soe.ucsc.edu/advising-office-faqs)

6833,Housing Avaliable,1,2020-07-25 14:08:00,10,"Hello,

We have availability for housing along Peach Terrace for Fall Quarter and possibly longer which is about a 5 minute walk from the base of campus. A group of us, fourth years signed a lease for this upcoming school year but, someone of us chose to stay home to save money this year and we were looking for other individuals to stay there.

We have two rooms available, a single room and a master bedroom in a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom house since two of us plan to stay there in one room during the Fall 2020.

The smaller bedroom is 1,000/month and is generally a single but, could work as a double with a bunk bed (500/month).

The master bedroom is 1475/month which comes with its own walk-in closet and private bathroom. It’s very spacious but, it could be made into a single, double (738/person), triple (492/person), or even quad (369/person)if that works with you or knew a group of people you wanted to live with.

The house comes with a washer, dryer, and really basic living room furniture. It also has a parking spot if you needed it since none of us living there will not have a car.

A little bit about us living there in the fall:

Me: A 4th year BMEB major which is usually busy with the classes I am taking or doing research. In my free time, I like play a bit of video games, hiking, and chilling with friends. Honestly, always down to try new things and usually go with the flow if I have time to.

My roommate: A 4th year EEB major which enjoys video games, spending time with friends, and watching TV/YouTube. Moises is probably one of the chillest guy I’ve met and is always down to try new things. We generally get along with most and go with the flow of whatever is happening

We really don’t mind who we live with and are pretty welcoming to everyone. Whether your social or keep to yourself, want advice, or just want to hang out or try something new, we’re always down and also understand if your busy with classes or just like being alone too. However, we do prefer living students or graduates just to ensure you would stay during the quarter and live with people around the same age but, if you still needed a place to live, we really don’t mind. The only thing we would want is someone willing to live at the house for at least through Fall Quarter (Oct-Dec).

Feel free to PM me with any questions, clarifications, and pictures/videos of the place. Thanks!!",0.06315510730404349,0.44978354978354984,ucsc

I came up on a older post about taking this class online, and it seemed like the general consensus was not to, because the system for it sucked. 

I mean, I don't know much about how its gonna work at UCSC, and I wanted to take classes that weren't gonna require my full stress and energy right off the bat so I could adjust better, like going with Math 3 and CSE 20 this quarter. (Yes I am a proposed TIM major) 

For context: 

I took Math all 4 years of my HS, all the way up to AP Calc AB. Had a really tough teacher, got a C- first semester, mostly because of me picking a shitty schedule and not balancing my work. Got a B second semester, was able to get a better schedule, put more time into the class, and felt semi-comfortable with the concepts, and the workload. (Before all this shit happened)

The issue is that my HS isn't a particularly good HS, a lot of the teachers in general didn't cover certain topics or feigned ignorance for some aspects of the class. I'm mainly concerned that the gap between these two environments is too different. 

TL;DR: Context, and should I take Math 19A this quarter with it being online and all, or hold it off to Winter or Spring?",0.19065656565656566,0.4910443722943723,ucsc

My end goal is to work on autonomous robotics and cybersecurity, and I feel Cal Poly would prepare me better for that if I can successfully change majors.

Is it worth it to try emailing grad students as well and see if they need assistance with their research, and if so, how do I go about doing that?


Also if labs are pretty much just a no-go this year, do fourth years have any chance at all to get into labs? I've read that it's pretty difficult because they prefer to have students who can stick around for more than a year :( The first two years of my undergrad I was kind of just choosing general bio lower-divs because I wasn't sure if marine bio was for me, hence why I didn't try to get into any labs, but I think I've decided to stick to it.

I'm an incoming transfer student to the SOE's Bioinformatics concentration. 

I have a gut feeling this whole academic year is going to be online, which takes away one of my two years for time on campus to make connections with professors and involve myself in EC's. I think getting out in two years with one of them online might handicap me when graduate school applications roll around, so I'm considering spreading my coursework out to three years. 

I'm just afraid that my 6-year BS will look bad on my CV since I already spent 3 years at my community college. Also, I've always wanted to study abroad and I'd have more options to do that through UCSC if I have an extra year! 

I'd love to hear other transfer students' experiences with taking 3 years to graduate, and whether or not this has negatively impacted you, as well as any transfer study abroad stories/experiences. Thank you all!",-0.06999999999999999,0.4041666666666667,ucsc

If it does, I want to rent a living space in Santa Cruz and go in on the rent with a few roommates. Even if classes are online, I think it would supplement for some of the college experience, at least until campus fully reopens again.

If this sounds like something you want and your a Santa Cruz student don't hesitate to message me! I'm an incoming frosh, don't mind loud noises or music, usually sleep pretty late (12:00 - 2am, but I'm not super loud so if you sleep earlier I wouldn't keep you up), and don't make too much of a mess in my room. My major is robotics, and I'm mostly STEM oriented. I can help with homework on compsci (java, c++), calculus (up to Taylor series in ap calc bc), physics (up to Maxwell's equations in physics c), and if you ever need help with wiring microcontrollers or embedded systems for projects, I have some experience there too. I'm mostly terrible at humanities though, so I probably won't be much help there :/

We have a washer / dryer, lots of storage space, a nice backyard and private parking. The room faces east and gets really nice morning light. The room is $888 with a shared bathroom and the deposit is 1.5x the monthly rent. 

Who we are: we are a mix of alumni and students. We have a kitten and a dog. We aren't interested in having extra pets because we have a small common living space. Pets that have to leave your room is a no. Caged animals are fine though. 

Because the common living space is small and quarantine still happening, we like to all keep up after the house and expect the 6th person to do the same. We keep it fairly quiet at night. 

We all just want a housemate who will contribute to a clean environment, is friendly and respectful.

So basically, we've been going back and fourth with the physics dep. chair, who generally feels that Dhar isn't doing anything wrong. However, it seems we've succeeded in pressuring him into pressuring dhar to either give out grades or start the official academic dishonestly investigation process (specifically by making each student aware of their misconduct charges and setting up a meeting to fill out the form with them). It seems Dhar's done the latter. 

We're trying to figure out if he sent you guys a copypasta. Did dhar email you that, essentially, he has received evidence that your Chegg account was used to view chegg exam solutions during the exam? Are you confused because you didn't use chegg during the exam? Did he not specify which exam or whether it was in Phys 6A or 6B? 

What did dhar say to you? If he copypasta'd yall, we got a better case to push to the Committee on Course Edu if this keep dragging on. *Please* feel free to dm me the email he sent you or comment below. 

I advise you guys to set up the meeting, because it sounds like hes going thru the process legit now. That means you have rights, and whatever he accuses you of has to be reviewed with you by your provost (evidence and all). Don't confess to anything you didn't do. Be ready for the meeting. [Here's](https://ue.ucsc.edu/academic-misconduct.html) how the procedure should go. You have rights, and if he copypasta accused you of chegg crimes, its gonna be all the easier to prove your innocence when he finally follows the rules.

I plan on majoring in CS game design.

I also want it to be portable since I will be taking it to classes, libraries, etc. 

I want this laptop to last as long as possible (it’s an investment) so I can use it after college too. 

My budget is $1,000-$1,500, although I’d prefer a sale. Aside from portability and SSD, I’m aiming for a fairly good CPU and GPU, and screen size between 14-16 inches.",0.08035714285714284,0.35000000000000003,ucsc

When I transfered, my assembly class didn't get the CSE12/L credit, which was cool. CSE 12/L was pretty easy anyways. A nice way to start the year.

That was great because 101 opens the door to a plethora of super awesome CS classes.

As a transfer I already felt a bit behind, because I only had 5 quarters left to take all the cool electives, so making transfers take the class in their winter quarter seems inadequate. Furthermore, as someone who took CE 12/L and CS101, it doesn't seem like CE 12/L should be a prerequisite.

 My original goal was to go for Mechanical engineering at CPP or at any of the UC's I feel like this is so sudden and fast as I don't know much about this field, but I am very interested; I just feel like its a rash decision since I barely found out about it.  

 I saw a post that was like 7 years ago on how it's basically a bunch of coding classes, and I am gonna take a coding class this semester (im planning to transfer in fall 2021 btw) so I don't know if im even good at coding; however, I really love to build and I am planning to make a side project on building a rocket so I know it will be of great help once I start. 

 (BTW- I want to go for aerospace engineering for my graduate degree- unless you think that I should take aerospace in my undergrad and keep it consistent im kind of lost lol im just seeking advice on what would the smartest decision)

I entered the online meeting acting very courteous and polite. He said that he had evidence that I had cheated, and that he would be presenting it to the provost if I did not admit to the cheating (note that he was recording the Zoom call). I asked him very politely that I was uncomfortable admitting to an act of academic dishonesty that I did not commit. I asked him to present any evidence he had collected against me, so that I could possibly explain the descrepency. 

This is where Dhar started raising his voice. He said that there was no requirement that he show me his evidence, and that such a request would only hurt my case. I couldn't even get a word in edgewise. He continued to interrupt me, and when I tried to jut in he screamed ""I KNOW YOU ALL CHEATED - HALF THE CLASS CHEATED. YOU'LL ALL GET ZEROS! JUST WATCH!"" and he rage quit, ending the call. It was extremely unprofessional and I honestly I laughing after he signed off, it was so ridiculous. 

Anyways, if any of you have to get on calls with him to face academic misconduct charges, I would ask to see the evidence he has. My guess: he has none. He couldn't keep his poker face on during my meeting, and it's obvious that his attempt to prove anything will be fruitless.",0.03118055555555556,0.5175925925925926,ucsc

7218,Attention: To those of you who have met with or are meeting with Dhar about academic misconduct,1,2020-08-10 23:20:45,32,"Whether you cheated or not, you have rights. 

[Here is the UCSC Academic Misconduct Policy](https://ue.ucsc.edu/academic-misconduct.html) Pay special attention to the ""instructor meets with the student"" section - that's what's happening right now. 

Here's what you've got to do and know. 

1. **Attend the meeting**

Not attending counts as an admission of guilt. 

**2.    Do not confess to anything he doesn't show you evidence of**

It's clear that right now, Dhar is accusing anyone who he gave an ""I"" of cheating on an exam by accessing chegg during the exam. You should know that this accusation is a copypasta - he sent you all the same email, regardless of what he actually originally suspected you of months ago. So, unless he shows you evidence of something *you actually did*, don't confess to it! Don't ruin this for the people who didn't cheat on the exam!

3.   **Know that Dhar doesn't decide your fate - your provost does**

He's going to tell you that asking to see the evidence or not confessing is hurting your case - but, if you end up explaining to your provost that you didn't confess to anything because Dhar never showed you what you were accused of doing, that's definitely not going to hurt you. In fact, every thing that Dhar messes up (via the policy) is going to protect you at the provost level. 

Here are the things Dhar should to do via the school's policy, as far as I understand it:

* **Discuss the situation**
   * Like, what you actually did. 
* **Use the** [**Academic Misconduct Form**](https://ucsc-advocate.symplicity.com/public_report/index.php/) **during the meeting**
   * This does *not* mean telling you to fill it out on your own. 
* **Include your comments in the Academic Misconduct Form**

*After the meeting:*

* **Within** ***five (5)*** **work days of the meeting, submit the form to your provost** ***with the evidence and your comments*** 
* (not too sure about this one) **Give you your grade**

&gt;After meeting with the student and submitting the form, the instructor assigns the course grade in the normal way, taking into account the academic sanction.  The remaining process determines whether or not a disciplinary sanction will be imposed.  If the disciplinary process results in a finding that academic misconduct did not occur, or that it cannot be determined whether or not such occurred, the instructor may initiate a procedural change of grade to reflect the outcome, if they wish to do so. 

I don't know exactly how to interpret that, but it seems to suggest you get your grade until the whole process is over. 

# If Dhar doesn't do any of those things, that is grounds to appeal the decision the Provost comes to. 

That's only if it gets to that point, though. You should know that, when you meet with the provost,

* **The provost must listen to your account of the situation**
   * This means that you have a chance to explain if Dhar totally cheesed the form
* **Students may change their pleas at the time of this meeting**
   * This means that if the provost shows you evidence of misconduct, you can plead guilty. There's nothing wrong with pleading innocent when not shown evidence, and then pleading guilty when its presented to you later. You have every right and duty to not plead guilty to charges without evidence, *even if you cheated!!* If the provost presents you with new evidence, you can change your plea then.
   * This also means that, *if you already met with him and pleaded guilty,* you can change that and explain the situation. 

This has all sucked, and it's scary as hell. I'm sorry you've all had to go through this. If you want further explanation, help with appealing or preparing, to commiserate, or literally anything else, feel free to DM me. I'm one of the people who's been pushing this issue with the dep chair, and the one that's been making a lot of these posts. I don't have an ""I"", but apparently I love sending emails. I really am happy to help any of you petition the CCI or figure out what to do next. 

This has been a long battle, but we're gonna come out on top. Also, responding to this is in no way an admission of guilt.",0.07327091513138026,0.5492520722171885,ucsc

7281,Is 21 Credits in 1 quarter too much???,1,2020-08-13 15:31:36,16,"Hey reddit people,

I'm an incoming freshman (RCC!) trying to make a rough plan for my classes this year. I'm planning on double-majoring in marine biology and environmental sciences! Currently I am enrolled in CRSN 1, MATH 19B and CHEM 1a for the fall. I'm considering enrolling in PHYS 6A and L (1 credit) as well on the first day of instruction. That would be 21 credits total for fall quarter. I'm taking summer classes right now so I will have a GPA for fall quarter, and assuming it's above 3.0 I theoretically shouldn't have issues doing this (I think).

I'm wondering if anyone has some input on this? My thinking is that 21 credits in 10 weeks should be fine since I'm currently taking 12 credits in 5 weeks (LALS 75 and STAT 7/L), but I don't really have a feel for how challenging it might be since I've never taken a full quarter of classes before. I also know that summer session is different than the rest of the year and I'll be taking comparatively harder classes in the fall. Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated!

The only way I was even able to afford going to UCSC was through a CalGrant, a CalGrant I only received based on the expense of living on campus. When COVID started and Spring got loved online, I had to make a lot of calls and emails trying to figure out if moving home for quarantine would result in me losing my aid. I was eventually told that “legislation was being passed that would enable me to keep my financial aid given the extraordinary circumstance.”

Fast forward to summer. I’m supposed to apply for housing or live at home. COVID is still happening. Outbreaks are speeding up again. UCSC is still saying, to my knowledge, that if you can stay home, you should. So naturally I apply to love at home, expecting the legislation that let me keep my financial aid to still be in play.

APPARENTLY NOT

I just got my aid award. Surprise, surprise! Lost my CalGrant! There’s no way I can afford to go to school. Or at least that’s what it looks like? It appears the cost for me of tuition is still a full cost of $35,000 despite not living on campus? Shouldn’t the price be dramatically less if housing costs aren’t being added in?

This is not an evacuation order, but rather a warning to be prepared to evacuate. 


An evacuation center for UC Santa Cruz students and employees living on campus is established at the Boardwalk Parking Lot at 515 Beach St., Santa Cruz, CA 95060. 


Evacuation centers for the broader Santa Cruz community are open at Santa Cruz County Fairground, 2601 E. Lake Avenue in Watsonville, and Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium, 307 Church Street, Santa Cruz.  


To reach the evacuation center at the Boardwalk, individuals may drive, walk, bicycle, or use a bus, if available. Campus transit shuttles or Metro route 19 will be available for those on campus to get to the Boardwalk. Please go to the nearest loop transit stop to board a shuttle or bus.


If an evacuation order is issued, traffic may be congested. Campus community members who do not need to go to the Boardwalk should leave Santa Cruz on Highway 1 south.


Only use 911 for true emergencies. 


Notes

An evacuation warning is issued when the threat is plausible for fire activity to increase and your residence may be in the affected area. 


An evacuation order is issued when the area is determined to be an immediate threat to life and property. ",0.1763888888888889,0.4534722222222222,ucsc

The classes I'm not sure about are: CSE 130, CSE 102, and CSE 114. I'm also working part-time in the fall so I kinda want fall quarter classes to be a bit less time-consuming.

My first option is to take CSE 130 w/ Nawab + ECE 130 w/ Yanik + CSE 185 w/ Gould in the fall and CSE 102 w/ Fremont + CSE 114 w/ Flanagan + ECE 171 w/ Pedrotti in the winter.

My second option is CSE 130 w/ Nawab + ECE 130 w/ Yanik + ECE 171 w/ Petersen in the fall and CSE 102 w/ Fremont + CSE 114 w/ Flanagan + CSE 140 w/ Getoor in the winter.

My dilemma is basically whether I should take 171 in the fall or winter, because I've heard that it's a really challenging class (and it's going to be especially difficult for me since I struggled in ECE 103). I'm leaning toward taking it in the winter, but I'm not sure if it'll be manageable with 102 and 114.

If anyone's taken any of these classes/profs, I'd love input on how the experience was overall in terms of difficulty and time. Additionally, if anyone would be willing to help me plan out which classes to take together (besides the ones I posted above), I'd really appreciate if you could PM me! I'm just really confused overall about these classes.

Most buildings at school are concrete and fire-proof. There are very few buildings that are at risk (namely Oakes college). There have been other UCSC facilities (the observatory) at risk and firefighters have been able to thwart the risk of fire, at least for now. The state is more likely to protect itself rather than people’s private property (unfortunately imo). They will find a way to divert the fire even if it means triage-ing resources especially as CalFire is running the show. UCSC is not what we should be worrying about right now.

What we need right now is to support those who had to evacuate and/or lost their homes. We do not need fear mongering that the school is going to explode, as that is counterproductive at the moment.",0.054928571428571424,0.5975952380952382,ucsc

7507,How to track the fire,1,2020-08-21 16:09:42,3,"Here are some high quality sources of information about the fire affecting UC Santa Cruz. Feel free to share your favorites in the comments, along with an explanation of why you think it's valuable.

&amp;#x200B;

The official name of the fire is ""CZU Lightning Complex"" which you can use to search for information about the fire.

**Tracking**

If you want to know where the fire is located:

 [https://maps.nwcg.gov/sa/#/%3F/%3F/37.0412/-122.1041/13](https://maps.nwcg.gov/sa/#/%3F/%3F/37.0412/-122.1041/13) 

Key: red dots are active fire, orange is ""was active 12-24 hours ago"", yellow is ""was active 24-48 hours ago."" 

This site is only updated every couple of hours. *It is not real time. Location of dots is approximate, and may be off by several hundred feet.*

The source of this information is satellite imagery.

Another site that provides satellite imagery fire information is:

 [https://caltopo.com/map.html?fbclid=IwAR2qZyiNUR-3PFKt7OEKIXVLSXLclsG25sbysvabYYcFEDjL3Br5Sh0B--g#ll=37.05257,-122.09982&amp;z=13&amp;b=map&amp;a=modis\_mp](https://caltopo.com/map.html?fbclid=IwAR2qZyiNUR-3PFKt7OEKIXVLSXLclsG25sbysvabYYcFEDjL3Br5Sh0B--g#ll=37.05257,-122.09982&amp;z=13&amp;b=map&amp;a=modis_mp) 

It is more precise about which satellite/algorithm is the information source for a map dot. 

**Wind Conditions**

The best site for current and predicted wind conditions is:

[https://www.windy.com/?37.011,-122.050,11](https://www.windy.com/?37.011,-122.050,11)

Wild fires tend to move in the direction of the wind. Note that terrain features (steep slopes, rivers, fire breaks) can affect fire direction as well. Higher wind speeds generally mean fires spread faster.

**Weather Predictions**

Weather Underground provides decent weather predictions, but its strength is access to weather radar images and access to reports from specific weather stations. This can give you more precise on-the-ground weather conditions.

 [https://www.wunderground.com/weather/us/ca/santa-cruz](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/us/ca/santa-cruz) 

The NOAA (National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration) provides exceptionally high quality weather forecasts. The best is the ""Forecast Discussion"":

 [https://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=MTR&amp;issuedby=MTR&amp;product=AFD&amp;format=CI&amp;version=1&amp;glossary=1](https://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=MTR&amp;issuedby=MTR&amp;product=AFD&amp;format=CI&amp;version=1&amp;glossary=1) 

This is a narrative description of the weather forecast, as well as broader regional weather context. It can be technical, but if you work your way through the discussion, you should be able to understand it. There are links for definitions of terms.

**Twitter**

For a scattershot sampling of on the ground reports, photos, videos, etc. you can follow the #CZULightningComplex hashtag on Twitter.

Most SC landmarks we took for granted won't be around when students come back. It was a tourist town and thanks to the virus it would spend a year with no student income with high tax and rent. Going forward, the disruption to the education pipeline and the massive coming recession means SC will find it harder to find students and make itself even more expensive to go there so income is even more reduced.

August 26, 2020

To: UC Santa Cruz community

From: Chancellor Cynthia Larive

Subject: Re-opening employee housing, rest of campus remains closed

This evening Cal Fire lifted its emergency evacuation order for the UC Santa Cruz residential campus. 

I have amended the Aug. 20 emergency declaration so that employees who live at Laureate Court, Hagar Court, Ranch View Terrace, Hagar Meadow, and Cardiff Terrace can return to their homes tonight. The rest of the residential campus **remains closed**, as do the Coastal Science Campus and Westside Research Park. 

We know everyone is eager to return to campus, whether it’s for student housing, to conduct research, or to provide on-site services. We are eager too, but must first ensure all pieces are in place for our community to begin returning to these sites. Closing the residential campus last week required us to shut down several critical systems, including our cogeneration plant, our natural gas systems, and other basic infrastructure. They must be returned safely online before the campus is fully repopulated.

Additionally, parts of the upper campus, including Family Student Housing, remain without power, and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. are not sure when power will be restored. We will continue to provide updates in the days and weeks ahead. 

**Except for the people living in the employee housing communities outlined above, no one should attempt to access the residential campus, Coastal Science Campus, or Westside Research Park until directed that it is OK to do so**.

We are optimistic that we will very soon be able to re-open our Coastal Science Campus and Westside Research Park. With the Cal Fire order lifted, we are working hard to ensure our residential communities are ready to welcome back the students that were forced to evacuate. 

Reopening the residential campus will be deliberate and phased. Everything will be done to support the health and well-being of our community, and in a way that helps to minimize the spread of COVID-19.

We are immediately focused on restoring critical campus infrastructure, allowing employees and families to return to campus housing, and resuming services provided by our COVID-19 diagnostic lab and our Student Health Center. 

With Cal Fire lifting evacuation orders for several areas, people should anticipate traffic congestion and limited visibility due to smoke. I encourage us all to be patient and kind, particularly in these moments of collective stress. 

Faculty and staff should be ready to show their campus or other ID to enter employee housing communities and should exercise caution when returning to their homes, especially if they do so after dark. I encourage you to visit one of the following sites about who to contact and tips for returning home following a wildfire:

* [Red Cross: Be Prepared for Wildfires during COVID-19](https://www.redcross.org/content/dam/redcross/get-help/pdfs/wildfire_preparedness/Be_Prepared_for_Wildfires_during_COVID-19_07062020.pdf)

* [FEMA: Returning From Evacuation](https://community.fema.gov/ProtectiveActions/s/article/Wildfire-Returning-from-Evacuation-Ground-Safety)

While we are fortunate the wildfire never reached our residential campus, the ash and smoke it created entered our buildings, requiring that we assess and clean some areas of campus before they can be reopened.

In the coming days, we expect to allow research labs approved under our COVID-19 restrictions and some student housing to reopen, and that dining services will resume preparing meals at our residential campus. As a reminder, you can find consistent updates at [ucsc.edu/fire](http://ucsc.edu/fire). 

Our community has shown exceptional strength and compassion in the face of great adversity. We are beginning the long road of recovering from this wildfire. I know we will emerge a more resilient and close-knit campus and community.

2. My parents plan on moving to California in the spring/summer of 2021- would I have residency for the UC's? 
3. Is UCSC underrated? On US News, it's similar to UC Riverside, but after talking to friends in CA, it doesn't seem to be true. There's other colleges I found that seem significantly underrated by US News (UT Austin, University of Washington-Seattle), but other ranking sources typically have these schools near the top. Would you put UCSC at the level of UCR, or closer to like UCSB/Irvine (which is what I'm thinking).
4. Is STEM at UCSC significantly better than many other majors, like UCSD or UW/UT? Or is that not the case, and are all majors similarly strong.",0.14404761904761904,0.4773809523809524,ucsc
7600,"Dhar ""Academic Dishonesty"" Update: The provosts are in on this; do Not negotiate with Dhar, email your provosts",1,2020-08-26 23:14:29,35,"Welcome back guys

**The provosts are up to speed**

As of five days ago, the chair of the Council of Provosts, Alan Christy, has been made aware of what's been going on, after I emailed provost Abrams about the general situation. Provost Abrams said that the council would discuss it, and Provost Christy said he was reaching out to people to set up interviews. I don't know whether any of this has happened yet. However, their response indicated they'd be taking the matter seriously. 

**It doesn't seem Dhar has submitted anything to provosts yet**

Provost Abrams said this was the first she'd heard of the issue. Provost Christy didn't indicate he was aware either.  With the volume of allegations, it's unlikely they just wouldn't happen to have any affected students. Furthermore, nobody I know of has had correspondences with their provosts regarding a meeting. This all strongly suggests that *professor Dhar has not submitted anything, including the misconduct form or any evidence.* It has been well over the five (5) working days within which Dhar is to submit the form as mandated by the school's policy. 

**Do not bargain with Dhar**

It's possible now that we've taken action and made the Council of Provosts aware, Dhar will begin to feel some pressure to quickly resolve the situation. You should know that a hearing with your provost is your right as a student, and Dhar's behavior suggests that he doesn't exactly have evidence against you, or at least that it won't be easy for him to prove when you get to your provost (especially if he tries to bargain). The more students that do the actual misconduct process, the better chance we have at making this end fairly. 

**What is** **""Appealing""?**

Appealing can refer to (from what I understand) two or three things in this situation. 

*Review from the  Academic Tribunal* 

&gt; If the student maintains that the charge is unfounded or the sanction unwarranted, or the provost believes that there is insufficient evidence to support the instructor’s claim, the case is forwarded electronically to the Analyst for the Council of Provosts within five (5) working days of the provost’s meeting with the student.  

The tribunal can make a final decision on your case. 

*Submitting an appeal to VPDUE*

&gt; Appeals will be granted only if one or more of the following conditions are met:  
&gt;  
&gt;There is evidence that, in coming to a decision and imposing disciplinary sanctions, **there has been a violation of university policies, campus regulations, or a student’s rights of due process,** and such violation(s) more likely than not affected the Tribunal’s decision regarding responsibility or sanction;

This is the one where all of Dhar's misconduct comes into play!  There's been a great deal of it - the excess of time that's passed, the multiple meetings, the never presenting evidence, the never doing the misconduct form, the intimidation.....They can overturn the decision made by the tribunal. You have to contact them within ten days of the tribunal decision.  

*Petitioning the CCI to appeal your grade*

Only Dhar and the CCI have power of your grade (from what i know)

&gt; A grievance may be filed if the student believes that the instructor has given a course grade or evaluation of the student’s work by criteria that were not clearly and directly related to the student’s performance in the course for which the grade or evaluation was assigned, as by the use of:   
&gt;  
&gt;\-  Capricious or arbitrary application of academic criteria in a manner not reflective of student performance in relation to course requirements. 

The process (in my own words) is as follows: If a student cannot resolve their grievance concerning their grade with both their professor or their dep chair/provost's help, a student may appeal to the CCI. The CCI considers, investigates, and reaches a decision. This is the only way to change your grade if Dhar still won't give it to you after the provosts rule you innocent and urge him to change the grade. Either you can't or shouldn't do this until after the misconduct process has been completed. 

So basically, you can't do any of these things until after your hearing with your provost.

*What is not an appeal*

Pursuing your right to a meeting with your provost is not an appeal. It's part of the process laid out in the Academic Misconduct Policy. It is your right. 

**Reporting Dhar's Conduct**

This one is hard. I don't know a whole lot, but we may have grounds to report him for violating the [Faculty Code of Conduct](https://apo.ucsc.edu/policy/capm/002.015.html). It seems you address the complaint to the Campus Provost. [Here's the actual code.](https://www.ucop.edu/academic-personnel-programs/_files/apm/apm-015.pdf) Types of unacceptable conduct include:

&gt; Failure to meet the responsibilities of instruction, including:   
&gt;  
&gt; (d) evaluation of student work by criteria not directly reflective of course performance;   
&gt;  
&gt; (e) undue and unexcused delay in evaluating student work. 

You may be able to argue ""e"" considering you do not have your grade and you have not been convicted of misconduct for that last one

**What you should do: Talk to your provost!!!!!!**

Though some students have reached out to their provosts and some may at this point be generally aware of the situation, *you should still reach out to your provost!!!* This is quite possibly the best thing you can do for your own case right now. This is really what your provosts are for. Email your provost a short summary of what's happened to you personally. If you believe you've tried your best to cooperate, tell them that. If you've been stressed, tell them that. If your class enrollment/major declaration/anything else has been affected by this, tell them that. They will be the next person to hear your case, and they can help you ensure that your rights are afforded to you. *The more people that talk to their provosts, the more clear it will become to them that this situation is a bunch of whump!* 

**tl;dr:** Dhar's still at it, council of provosts is gonna discuss, and he hasn't submitted anything to provosts yet. You can't appeal anything until after you meet with your provost, its your right to have that meeting, and its in your best interest to have that meeting. 

If anyone would like help with any process, their case, or anything, or to share information, or to commiserate, feel free to dm or comment. I am happy to research the complaint process with you, or tell you whether I think the stuff he said in meetings with you counts as misconduct. Anything, really.

* Location: Online
* Instructor: Prof. Lise Getoor

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Join us to learn the basics of machine learning and data science algorithms and the fundamentals of analyzing the social impacts of technical systems.  This course will cover both technical and humanist frameworks related to automated decision making.   Topics will be grounded in current issues such as algorithmic bias, (dis)information propagation and privacy.   These are especially relevant given current events including COVID, BLM, and looming elections.

You will come away with a new set of machine learning and algorithmic skills, and an appreciation for how algorithms can impact individuals and society.   There is increasing societal concern about the disparate impacts and unintended consequences of algorithmic decision making.   You will be among a small group that are trained to recognize the issues and address the challenges!

This course provides an introduction to data-driven and algorithmic decision making and ethical frameworks for evaluating automated systems.  There will be an emphasis on algorithmic literacy, critical analysis, and fundamental limitations of automated decision making.   We will cover concepts including predictive and causal modeling.   We will discuss bias, fairness, interpretability, privacy, and accountability.   Finally we will discuss notions of autonomy and algorithmic auditing.

Modules include:

* Algorithmic Decision Making
* Ethical &amp; Critical Analysis Frameworks
* Fairness
* Interpretability &amp; Explanation
* Causal Reasoning
* Privacy
* Autonomy &amp; Accountability

7642,My opinion on admin's decision regarding on campus housing.,1,2020-08-28 15:02:18,11,"These are my thoughts about why the admin may be considering wildfire risk as a reason to cancel housing in addition to COVID 19. Also they are the product of my overactive mind imagining what would happen.

The CZU complex fire is within 2 miles of campus (measured from the two gates on empire grade) last I checked. That distance can be covered by a fire in a couple hours or less. Faster if the wind and humidity are not cooperating. It could sweep upper campus relatively quickly but may have difficulty with the roads.

Imagine normal traffic trying to get off campus around 5:00 PM. Bumper to bumper from science hill to the west entrance. Now add to that thousands of on campus residents also trying to leave, grabbing as much of their shit as they can. It wouldn't only be residents, but researchers and faculty trying to save work and materials. All they have to work with is two relatively small roads. A worst case scenario can start looking grim. 

This time we got lucky with the marine layer and positioning of lightning strikes. Although the climate around here is changing frighteningly fast. I don't remember it being so dry in the SF bay area or central coast a decade ago. Dry thunderstorms aren't normal here and many long time residents I have asked have never seen something like the one that sparked the fires. Now we have had two in a month. 

There is also plenty of fuel on the ground on campus. They have controlled burns but they obviously don't do that in a lot of parts of upper campus or around buildings. Many buildings have no defensible space around them.

We have concrete buildings. Those likely won't burn to the ground. The enemy there is heat. Heat can break glass. Once glass is broken the building can burn from the inside out. Fire suppression systems may help but I have a feeling no one wants to test that hypothesis by surrounding a building with fire.

Having COVID testing for not just campus but the city disabled is a problem. There isn't a way to quarantine people reliably without it and contact tracing working in tandem. It sounds like they may do the spring quarter method again with only those with no where else to go on campus.

The admin isn't dumb. They know the risks and I have a feeling that they have been spooked and are re-evaluating the risk to campus while playing it safe for now.",-0.027688172043010762,0.5037634408602151,ucsc

Like this is not for me,  and I don't want to dig myself into a hole doing something I hate. Oddly enough I like my calc 2, and discrete math class more than I do with my  programming class right now. Heck even my sociology class is more  interesting.

7666,Why I canceled my housing contract.,1,2020-08-29 11:56:24,8,"As u/lemoncakes285 put it beautifully, “Keep in mind SCM lost almost 1000 homes (&gt;50% damage = destroyed), and we are only 75% of the way done with damage inspections. And this doesn't include homes that are damaged (less than 50% damage), but can be fixed but are inhabitable during the construction period. So there will be a large influx of students coming in from the fires.

I'm still waiting on them to do my home, we are unsure if it's standing as we are still evacuated (last I heard there was a fire that got out of control 1/2 mile away from our house). I've talked to other UCSC students that live in the SCM and know that their homes have burned now (either saw it burning in front of them, caught it on the news, or it's on a damage map), and now will be living on campus. So they need to have space for all these students who weren't planning to live on campus (and employees, UCSC is the number one employer in santa cruz) to live, plus it's COVID19 so we have restrictions on how many people can live in a dorm. So they are just trying to weed out students who really DON'T need to be on campus. There's a difference between your siblings being loud and not having infrastructure.”

I was in a sticky situation where I did not have a great learning environment (as in I have resources to learn, but my environment makes it difficult to concentrate and learn effectively). I was split between canceling my contract and trying to fit into an exemption. After reading lemoncakes’ post several times over, it became abundantly clear to me that after the damage done to Santa Cruz and the surrounding area, I had to cancel. I know many of you are in the same position. Now is the time to sacrifice our want for someone else’s need. If it truly comes down to it, you can always find leases in Santa Cruz via the Facebook group for housing. The path that I’m looking at right now is deferring for a quarter and hoping that life will resume as planned afterwards. I find the lack of communication and short notice given by admin truly unprofessional but that’s a different discussion. Hopefully this helped.",0.1633935508935509,0.473840048840049,ucsc

7671,Advice on Housing Contract + whatever else,1,2020-08-29 14:39:43,16,"I accidentally deleted the last draft I had on this so rip but also it’ll help with slimming this down a bit.

Two overreaching ideas: one, my dad wants me to complete the housing contract using an exception. Second, I definitely understand why I should cancel my contract and it would be so much easier if I just could and suck it up and live with my family but it’s not so simple for me. This is going to be me oversharing but I’ve been losing my mind over this and it’s been less than 24 hours. So, ahead:

One, my parents are divorced. It’s been a 75-25 split between them basically my entire life. I’m eighteen now (kind of obvious but you never know) so it’s technically non applicable now. My mom— my primary caregiver— cannot provide a good environment for online learning. For one thing, I’ve already tried it and barely graduated high school, but that‘s definitely on me too. However, I also have two siblings doing online learning in that house and no enough rooms with stable connections to do it. I don’t have my own room, for one. My room also has the worst connection in the house. We have a guest house there but it has a tenant and kicking her out would not only (probably) take more time than we even have this quarter but would also subtract $750 a month from my mom’s income (for those confused, no she would not be the one paying for housing for me).

So, the main option is to live with my dad full time. Despite what I mentioned before, he’s willing to let me live there full time, that’s not the issue. I do have two (separate from the ones above) younger siblings (two and four respectively) that ARE noisy but that’s manageable. There is the running issue that they’re currently (physically)going to preschool right now but I already go to the house on and off and haven’t gotten sick yet. When I told my mom (before learning about housing and then unlearning about it) she went to bed crying. She said “I’ve been told throughout all your lives that you’d chose your father over me because he can provide better for you and now it’s coming true”. She came around the next morning but I have a feeling actually doing it is going to be pretty freaking tough. 

I’d originally really, really wanted housing so I wouldn’t have to choose. It’s the hard truth. What pisses me off so badly is that under any other circumstances I would never have to do that. But that’s null and void at this point.

I don’t want to lie just to get housing, that’s for sure and where some of my family disagrees with me. Some of my family never wanted me to go at all. It doesn’t matter what they want, really, and I get that but it’s absolutely no help. I don’t want to take housing away from people who need it. And I won’t if I can help it but I’m so, so, so upset over this. I don’t want to hurt anyone and it seems like no matter what I chose I’ll be doing that. I don’t know how to explain how difficult it is without sounding absolutely bratty. Even if it is, any sympathetic or at least honest replies would be great.

With all the stuff going on with on-campus housing, I thought that this might be a good opportunity to post about a spot that we have open.

My housemates are looking for one person (male) to fill a large double.

Here's some info on the house:

- The room (upstairs double) is $695 per person. The deposit is $867.50. Utilities not included, but ranged &lt;$100 per person (gas, electric, internet, water, etc) last year.

- Lease starts on 2020 September 1, ends on 2021 August 28. It might be a bit of a squeeze to get all the paperwork in before the first, but the landlord has been pretty lenient about stuff so far.

- House consists of 4 singles and 2 doubles, 2 bathrooms, a kitchen, pantry, basement, and under-stairs storage room.

- Total expected occupancy is 7 people, mixed gender. We're all UCSC and Cabrillo students. LGBT+ friendly. No pets or smoking please!

- The upstairs double comes with two double futon frames with mattresses, two desks, one rolling chair, two drawers in white, side table, two rugs to be placed under the beds, two curtains (one for each window), two armoires, and one pole for hanging clothes in the 6x6 area.

- The room also has a small storage space at landing at the top of the stairs.

- The room is easily divisible for additional privacy. You can hang up a curtain and/or push the armoires and included furniture to make a divider.

- House is pretty much located on Mission Street (very close to Mission Hill Middle School), and is roughly 4-7 minutes walking from the house to either a 10 or 16 stop. &lt;15 minute walk to Trader Joe's and the rest of the downtown area as well.

- 4 parking spaces on the driveway.

- Laundry machine and drying machine in the house.

- Has a basement for storage, accessible from the side yard. Currently used to store bikes.

- Kitchen has gas stoves and 2 refrigerators, so there should be plenty of space for food.

If you've got any questions or are interested, feel free to message me! We shot a video tour a while back, so we could probably start there as a way of showing you around.",0.1512167366946779,0.3952030812324931,ucsc

7698,taking a leave of absence for fall? is it smart?,1,2020-08-31 09:59:44,29,"after a lot of thought I’ve come to the point where I think that taking fall quarter off would be the best move for my mental health, but I’m hoping I can get some insight on if it is the wisest course of action. I’m an incoming sophomore and in AGPM, I’m feeling very unenthusiastic about my proposed major and wanting to change it. I want to take a quarter off to really figure out what feels exciting to me and what I want to focus my study on before I settle on a new major.
my big worry is that leaving will mess me up once I come back in winter and a quarter behind in my second year.

At the start of high school, I used to be lazy, easy going, carefree, etc. I always thought this was fine and I never thought critically about what I was doing, and how it would affect my future. 

It eventually hit me that my peers were more successful because they actually had a goal in life. I realized that I needed to do something to make a change. 

I started to work extremely hard and I finished a ton of college courses in high school, and was able to get my BS from UCSC at the age of 20.

While I got into a private school, it was too expensive for me to attend and I knew due to the start of my HS career, I was not going to be able afford any good college. This motivated me *even more* to make a change. 

I make this post because I see that a lot of people here never had this realization. They never had to adapt. Let’s face it, UCSC is objectively a bad school. People here never changed their values because they never had that struggle or that realization. They coasted through high school and they are coasting through UCSC, which is why they won’t be successful.

I’m not saying that getting a degree super quickly is the key, a lot of people misconstrue that as my point. My point is that you have to *work your ass off*. 

Even if I were to drop out of UCSC and throw my degree away, I know that I would be successful in the real world, due to the amount of work I have put into everything and quite frankly the knowledge I have of my field. It’s not your achievements, but your drive and power to create those achievements.

Bad timing to say the least. I'd been pretty optimistic things might be in-person this winter or at least spring if COVID numbers stay low in the county, but I'm seeing a real consensus here that it'll probably stay remote all year until a vaccine goes out.   
   
I only have two years at UCSC and I'm really struggling with hearing that, tbh. I haven't done any online classes with actual Zoom meetings yet, but the remote classes at CC just on Canva were not great experiences. Pretty hard to get engaged that way imo. Hoping Zoom will be better.   


I'm an older student, not worried about missing the 'college experience' socially, but I am worried about missing chances to network, build professional relationships, have one-on-one discussions to get career advice, etc. I was kind of in the process of exploring career options in my field when all this got started.  


I guess I'm wondering how other people are feeling about this - especially any other transfers who are going to miss at least 50 percent of their time at UCSC. Anyone finding good solutions to this? Also, I know classes are staying remote, but any other student resources on campus available in-person? Is it worth spending any time on campus anyway? Is it a viable option to be outdoors on campus if I don't have a great workspace at home? I live off-campus but very close-by.

After having bringing the issue to the attention of various administrators, we've finally made some concrete progress.

Both Dhar and the chair have been informed that their conduct was very much not in line with policy. Dhar's supervisors are now involved. Hopefully, this means he will not do something like this again, and I believe it means we now have someone to go with if there are further issues. 

Dhar has agreed to (or been told to) release everyone's grades. Several people got their grades today, but... I'm yet to hear about any that aren't fails. I have a guess that he may be assigning peoples grades uncurved. I'm not entirely sure who to go to yet (the supervisors now involved, the CCI, provosts, etc), but I'm certain there's someone. 

Students with substantial enough cases against them will have start the formal misconduct process ASAP (i know, that may sound empty to all of you at this point). I'm not sure what ""substantial"" constitutes. I can't be sure, but the rest of you should hopefully have your cases dropped. 

The official undergraduate education folks are going to be meeting to discuss academic misconduct during remote instruction within the next few weeks. Our experiences will be well represented. However, it seems to be this is more of a general discussion, not about our issue in particular. Hopefully we'll help other slugs avoid situations like this in the future.

**Here's my question for y'all: did Dhar fail you?**

Did you have an incomplete in his class? Check your grade! Tell me what it is, in dm's or comments. We need to know if he's failing everyone, or most people, or if he's giving final exam scores, etc. I fully intend to tattle on him on everyone's behalf if that's the case, and I feel like it won't be hard what with the attention he's earned himself from his supervisors.

7805,How I knew I was highly capable,1,2020-09-05 19:59:27,45,"This post won’t apply to most of you, but this is some really important information for people like me.

I don’t like to throw around the word “genius” because of its connotation but it really is an important concept to get a hold of. 

Whenever people notice that I got my MS by the age of 21, they say “I must be a genius” because of how quickly I got my MS. In reality, it is the other way around. Your intelligence doesn’t come from studying.

Quite frankly, it doesn’t matter whether you get your MS if you aren’t highly intelligent.

How did I know I was highly intelligent? This is the important question. I knew because I was able to quickly process advanced topics in high school while others struggled to learn rudimentary stuff. I was able to write a research paper without putting in a ton of effort.

You know you are extremely intelligent when your ability to get things done is very high. During my first year of college, I was able to secure an internship, write full stack applications, publish a research paper, and take upper division classes with relative ease.

If this is the case for you, my advice would be to make the most out of your abilities by graduating quickly and creating publications and such, since your abilities allow you to do things efficiently.

I am not sure if there is anyone with the same abilities or skills, but given the population of Santa Cruz it’s likely there is at least 1. So please take my advice",0.29260714285714284,0.5960436507936507,ucsc

It looks like you can take UCSC courses for $350/unit + $110 application fee. You have to get instructor approval for courses not listed on the site and IDK how this works for prerequisites but it looks like it's a lot cheaper if you want to just take one class ($1860 for 5 units vs $3700 for part time tuition).

Also does anyone know if any of the other UC's have announced anything? UCSC tends to decide last after every other UC has made a decision.

I paid for a year long parking permit out of anticipation of the campus reopening at least partially at some point, since it's better to have it than be without it if the time comes...(I also just stress too much about being able to park my car on campus) but TAPS released an email not too long ago announcing they're temporarily waiving the administration fee for cancellation of a permit, in case somebody would like to cancel receiving their pass.

Personally I think its pretty heinous the admin has yet to comment on whether or not the school will resume in person classes this year. I also thought it was a slap in the face of TAPS to offer a waiver of a $20 admin fee when we literally have no clue if in person classes will resume. Almost as if they were to say ""we'll let you take the gamble classes wont open up for the remainder of the year for free, but good luck trying to get your money back later if your pass winds up to be useless!""",0.05375,0.4270833333333333,ucsc

7933,Advice on CSE30 for incoming transfer for CS?,1,2020-09-11 19:44:44,3,"Hey everyone! So I’m an incoming transfer for computer science and I already took Stats 131 during summer edge (didn’t have much trouble with it). I’m not really sure how classes at UCSC will compare to the community college curriculum though so I’m worried about overextending myself in my first full-time quarter here. 

I was advised to take CSE 101 and 120 for the fall so I signed up for those, but I’m having trouble finding a third whether it’s general ed (all the open classes seem to have too many prereqs or require me to major in that field) or a random comp sci class. Right now I’ve signed up for CSE 30 (I got transfer credit for CSE 20) and I’m unsure how well my community college will have prepared me in python for this. What scares me a bit though is that the class is 7 units when the others are all 5. I just want to stay a full-time time student and learn without spreading myself too thin, and I’m not sure if the “extra/ unnecessary” class should take that much of my time. Any advice for whether it’s a hard class or if I should stick with it?

I’d love some insight from anyone who’s taken it or just has experience with the computer science classes at UCSC (the teacher is Luca De Alfaro).",-0.03785014005602242,0.5081465919701215,ucsc

7935,Confusion about Withdrawal Reminder email,1,2020-09-11 20:14:22,6,"Hey guys, I am an incoming transfer student and I am very confused and scared right now. Up until recently I was fine moving into the dorms, but now I may have other options for living space and I feel like it would be safer for me to cancel my housing contract. Today I got an email about withdrawal (im not withdrawing) which stated this in its “University Housing” portion:


“UNIVERSITY HOUSING:

Students scheduled to move-in for fall 2020: If you have decided not to live in university housing this fall, you must return to the Housing Portal (studenthousing.ucsc.edu) and cancel your housing contract. As a result of your withdrawal from the quarter, all financial aid you may have received for fall quarter will be rescinded from your MyUCSC student account. You may be billed for funds sent directly to you and/or your parents as the result of a financial aid refund. If you have questions about this process and financial aid, please contact the Financial Aid and Scholarship Office at (831) 459-2963 or by email to finaid@ucsc.edu.”

Does this mean that if I cancel my housing contract, I may lose ALL of my financial aid? I understand the way I’m reading it means that it only applies to people withdrawing from the quarter, but im just scared and confused because they placed it under the “university housing” portion immediately after explaining I should cancel my housing contract soon.

&amp;#x200B;

Please do not refer to Berkeley as “#2 Public University.” This is not the proper way to refer to the University of California's original and flagship campus. #1, The Best, or The GOAT are all proper and acceptable ways to say it. #2, on the other hand, is not.

As the system's most prestigious and respected campus, we feel that it is important to honor and maintain an appropriate level of respect for our university's ranking. We feel that ""#2"" 

cheapens our brand and doesn't emphasize the incredible prestige associated with Berkeley.

&amp;#x200B;

While it may be acceptable to refer to all other UC campuses in lower ranks due to their lack of recognition and prestige, this is not acceptable for the flagship and most well-known 

campus, and we therefore request that you cease using the name ""#2"" to refer to our school.

I'm currently in a position where pre-COVID, I had originally planned to double major and graduate in 3 or 4 years. My first major is Legal Studies, which is one of the lowest requirement majors at UCSC. Thanks to the amount of AP and dual enrollment credit I entered UCSC with as a freshman, I could hypothetically graduate as soon as winter quarter 2021, but more realistically spring.

TLDR: Is it possible to complete all the major requirements for Legal Studies, request a leave of absence, and then do one of the following

1. If I decide not to double major, apply for graduation at some later time and never resume taking classes at UCSC?

or

2.  Complete all my Legal Studies requirements but don't apply for graduation, returning when classes resume in person (which I suspect will be in 2022, but I could come back sooner) and complete my second major?

Mostly asking bc my other major requires some classes that I strongly would prefer to complete in person, and I don't trust what on-campus advisors say bc in my experience they basically want to milk students for tuition/campus fees. Thanks!",0.12083333333333333,0.33723118279569897,ucsc

Anywho, the story is, I waived my UCSHIP this Fall because my dad gives me my health insurance through his work. 

HOWEVER, he retires after Christmas this year, making me need Health insurance starting in the Winter quarter of 2021.

Big yikes, I'm not sure if I should just request to reverse my UCSHIP come Winter quarter, or....I don't know.

I know I need Health Insurance to go to UCSC, so I'm just wondering what everyone's thoughts on this situation are. Right now I'm going to just try and reverse my UCSHIP, but I'd like to know if there are alternatives that are easier/cheaper/etc.

There's also this thing my dad mentioned called Cobra that he could put me under when he retires, but he said it might be more expensive than UCSHIP, so he wants me to try and get my UCSHIP, but I'm not sure how easy that will be, or how much I can depend on that alternative.

If anyone has any insight, let me know. I've tried to do research on it myself but just ended up confusing myself even more (numbers scare me oops).

Anyway, thank you for any help and sorry if this question is easily answerable; I got a very vague answer from the UCSHIP people and could use some clarification so I don't end up insurance-less.

I recently received a call from UC Santa Cruz saying that I need to give my grant + health insurance (\~$3.5k) from Fall 2019 back because they over-rewarded me. I graduated back in December 2019, and was billed to give back the money around April 2020. I did not know about this charge until they gave me a call a week ago which was mid-September since I haven't checked my account at all since I graduated. The reason for re-adjustment that financial aid office gave me was because the school went over budget. Hence, I need to give the money back. My issue with this is that I used the money toward tuition and to the school in general. And, the fact that they billed me after I graduated?? 

Has this happened to anyone? If so, isn't this the school's fault? Do I have to give the money back?

I'm planning to pursue the AI &amp;Human Computer interdisciplinary elective. Everything was okay until my parents heard from a relative who works at Apple saying that there aren't many opportunities for CogSci students in the tech industry. he said only big tech companies like Google or Facebook would hire a UX designer/researcher. To be clear first, when I was asked what career I will get with CogSci major, I said UX design/research as that's what I like most. However, that's pretty much it, I admit that I don't know much about the major as I thought I was. **Can you please help me with some credible information about the major and its career options?** I'm open to learning anything from AI to Neuroscience. It's just hard to convince my parents that there are a lot of opportunities if I continue this pathway (or not??? correct me if I'm wrong). 

This decision is really important in my life as it decides whether or not I'll be able to continue studying CogSci at UCSC or move to Australia to study laws according to my parent's wishes.

8085,Only read if you’re concerned about the 2020 election:,1,2020-09-19 16:27:48,21,"We lost Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg yesterday. We’ve lost more that 200,000 Americans to a preventable epidemic. We are facing an election where the president is actively pushing for voter fraud and voter suppression. Forced sterilizations are being conducted in American immigrant concentration camps.

In a time where we feel so powerless, we must come together and organize for a better future while we can. After November 3rd it will be too late, and I’d hate more than anything to regret not doing enough when we had the chance to flip the senate, and remove trump.

If we don’t connect with swing state voters, someone else will. We have the power to write the narrative of what we want to see after November 3rd. It’s up to you. If you care enough to remove a fascist from the presidency, flip the Senate, win a wealth tax in impoverished states— all while sustaining a movement beyond electing Biden we MUST put in the work.


I am holding us accountable. For the time you spend posting on here, you could take the initiative to organize and mobilize for this upcoming election. It takes just one phone bank and one text bank session per week so that we can reach thousands (or potentially one million) of young voters in crucial swing states. Actions speak louder than words, and it’s up to you and I if we are truly repulsed at the increasingly apparent failures of our American democracy. 


If you want to join the cohort that I‘m leading with Student Action please direct message me. Everyone in the cohort is a college student, so scheduling is very flexible. We will provide training, field support, and weekly check-ins to ensure every campaigner is prepared and confident to carry out the fieldwork.


If you want to learn more, there will be a launch call on Monday the 21st at 5pm PST. You can join from anywhere and you may even see some familiar faces on the call! To those who have registered to get involved, I am very grateful to have you join the fight!

Meeting people through messaging on fb or ig usually gets dry quickly and it’s hard to get to know someone to the point where it will feel comfortable video chatting one on one.

I'm pretty sure that I will go above the 105 CC transfer limit, but I have some questions. Currently, I need 16 classes to graduate, but I am planning on taking 2 classes at CC in Fall due to unit restrictions. It says that I can get subject credit for those classes, does this mean that they will satisfy my GE requirements if I don't get the units?

I have 40 AP credits, which apparently are different from the CC transfer limit but some don't satisfy any requirements. If I only take 14 classes at UCSC (70 units) and my CC units (105) are maxed out, then I will have all my grad requirements done except the 180 units. 

Can I just use the AP credits which are basically irrelevant to boost me above 180, since they don't count towards the CC limit? Or am I wrong about this",-0.05123015873015872,0.610621693121693,ucsc

8146,Dhar Update: Help from Alan Christy; Send us a Testimonial!!!,1,2020-09-21 21:11:07,21,"Welcome back to the party everyone

**Update:**

Today we met with Alan Christy, the chair of the council of provosts, to discuss the fact that Dhar failed almost every single person caught up in this debacle. 

To catch everyone up, it's been almost three weeks since the dean of undergraduate education (i think) told Dhar he has to give out grades and do the cases right. He didn't do so, failed almost everyone, and has not started the academic misconduct process for almost anyone. One student received an explanation for their failed grade - Dhar confirmed it was not reflective of their performance in class but instead awarded because Dhar found the student guilty of misconduct (no evidence once again). So, it's safe to assume he failed most of you because he still thinks you're cheating. This is not okay. 

Alan was very sympathetic - he believes we have a very good case for grade petitions and complaints, and intends to try to persuade the relevant parties into giving students their grades. If that doesn't work and Dhar won't budge on grades, Alan believes the weight of a grade petition/complaint of this nature shouldn't be put on all of the individual students, so he is going to use all the info and evidence he's gathered to work with the CCI and at least make the grade petition/complaint process a lost easier on everyone. That's where you come in!

**We're gathering student testimonials**

Were you in PHYS 6A/6B with Dhar this Spring? Did you have a bad experience with him? Are you a victim of the Chegg witch hunt? Send me a short summary of your negative experiences with Dhar! *This goes tenfold for those of you who had meetings with him where he intimidated you, bullied you, withheld evidence from you,* ***offered you a plea deal (and especially if he later failed you),*** *etc.* It also goes for those who had requests to miss class or extend deadlines denied for horrible reasons, or who got yelled at during office hours, etc. 

Alan would like to use these testimonials in a case against Dhar's conduct. He believes his capricious behavior extends back through the whole Spring quarter, so any student in his Spring classes are welcome to send me a testimonial. *They will be anonymous.* They don't have to be long or special, and I'm happy to help you write them.   

Along with that, Alan told us that Dhar has promised to submit the misconduct forms within a week. So, you can expect an email from your provost, maybe. However, Dhar has made claims like that many times in the past.. If you don't get an email from your provost soon, that's an even better case against him. Also, it's best to file a CCI complaint *after* you've completed the academic misconduct process, so we're waiting for him to actually submit forms before we worry about that.

**Send me your experiences with Dhar! We're so close to ending this! With enough evidence** (and luck) **we may be able to avoid filing grade changes entirely**

Thank you to everyone who's helped us along the way - y'all rock. Huge thanks to Alan Christy, who is a super nice guy. If anyone wants help or more info, feel free to msg me!! Sorry for cluttering the subreddit with this stuff so often lol.",0.11401493930905697,0.49577964519140993,ucsc

There’s not many school wide events besides Cornucopia (club fair on 9/29). I know for a fact that Oakes and RCC are having welcome week events starting this Saturday because I am a Welcome Leader. If you belong to any of these 2 colleges then you can look on your google calendars and see the events and zoom links posted on there. I don’t know about the other colleges (I assume they are also planning events for first-years/transfers). But if not y’all are welcome to come to the Oakes and RCC events even if you aren’t in those colleges. In all of these events,  there’s also a chance to win gift cards. We are really trying to help you all adjust, make friends, learn, find mentors, have fun, etc. If you attend these events literally ask your welcome leaders anything! we want to support y’all and make your first year as painless as possible :)

I read this on the anthro departments page:

“Although applicants are accepted only for the Ph.D. program, students may obtain an M.A. degree after fulfilling specific requirements during the first and second year.”

I’ve sent out some emails but haven’t heard back. Does this mean MAs are only available along the way to getting a PhD? Or is it possible to get just an anthropology master’s degree at UCSC, without continuing to get an PhD?

I hope you're having a restful weekend, wherever you are!

If you are looking for some volunteer opportunities for experience and meaningful work this fall, I want to do a shout-out for Meals on Wheels Santa Cruz! 

I'm a student in the Everett Program, and my teammate and I worked with Meals on Wheels several months ago to create a promotional video about their response to Covid-19, as they shifted the way they deliver meals to older adults in the community. Our emphasis was on talking to folx living outside, and the impact of the program for them. I was able to interview several houseless individuals and felt lucky to talk to them and hear what they had to say! Meals on Wheels faithfully delivers daily to houseless people as well as people in their own homes, and I enjoyed hearing the conversations at delivery, and meeting the people who have worked there for years and believe in it!

8301,Rant,1,2020-09-28 15:12:37,20,"Hey y’all. 


I don’t post very often but I feel compelled to say this. You can choose to keep scrolling or read through it. It’s your choice. 

I feel downright disrespected as a student leader. A lot of the students who I’ve been in communication with can be really rude, even when I’m trying to be as kind and as helpful as possible to them. It might just be exacerbated by the fact that we’re all online and they think they’re anonymous when they’re behind a computer screen, but there’s still a person behind every screen. There’s still a human being with feelings behind every screen. We have been working really REALLY hard to build community, especially with the incoming frosh and transfers, but it feels overlooked. I, along with other student leaders, put a lot of effort into creating fun and enjoyable activities to do with y’all remotely, but that’s regarded as cheesy or cringy or lame. If it’s lame, can you please suggest a different approach? I welcome feedback. I welcome constructive criticism. But what I don’t have time for is blatantly hurtful comments about the events I’ve spent all week planning for. I don’t have time for attitude or hostility or cynical comments about how the university doesn’t care about its students. Even if that is true (which I don’t think it is, but that’s not the point here), I know I care about the students. I care about whether you feel like you belong at UCSC, I care about how you’re doing in your classes, I care about your mental health during shelter-in-place. This is probably sounding like a bitchy rant to you all, especially if you don’t work in a student-oriented role, but I think if we thought more about how much work people put into creating enjoyable and memorable experiences for others, we’d appreciate them more and look at them as human beings with the same feelings and emotions as the rest of us. All I want to do is connect with you to help you connect with others. I hope that’s not too much to ask for.",0.03333333333333333,0.5732843137254902,ucsc

I just checked Charges Due on MyUCSC and saw that payments for this quarter were due on 9/24. I also just checked that Financial Aid and just accepted the grants (which is enough to cover the outstanding fees listed under my charges). Apparently the disbursement date was 9/22.

Does anyone know what this means? Does that I won't be able to get the FA to pay for the Fall quarter? Or is it already processing after I just accepted it and I just have to wait? Should I just pay out of pocket for now and see what happens? I'm kind of spiraling because there are so many pages and unfamiliar jargon to tackle.

Is it more like a club or a legit team that competes? I really want to get good at surfing and find a good group of people to surf with but I don’t know how the club operates and if they accept newbies.

&gt;Hey! Good luck with your first day of class and the entire Fall quarter. Don't forget to reach out for help when you need it and take care of yourself!  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Can't find affordable **textbooks** for your classes? Check out some of these resources for online textbooks or physical rentals:  
&gt;  
&gt;LibGen: [*http://libgen.rs/*](http://libgen.rs/)  
&gt;  
&gt;Rent with Amazon: [*https://www.amazon.com/rentals/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=17853655011*](https://www.amazon.com/rentals/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=17853655011)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Taking a STEM course this quarter? Consider signing up for **ACE tutoring**! These small tutoring groups are a really amazing way to access supplemental instruction and find a group of people to work through tough problems with. This is a quarter-long commitment, but you can decide in the first week or two if it's a good fit for you. Check out the program and apply here: [*https://ace.science.ucsc.edu/*](https://ace.science.ucsc.edu/)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Interested in a lower commitment tutoring resource or need help in a non-stem course? Look into **MSI tutoring** for drop-in appointments in most courses. Check it out at this link: [*https://lss.ucsc.edu/programs/modified-supplemental-instruction/*](https://lss.ucsc.edu/programs/modified-supplemental-instruction/) , and use TutorTrac to sign up.

&gt;  
Confused about what classes to take? Need some help enrolling in a course? Unsure how to plan for GEs? Try talking to your **academic advisors**! They are such wonderful, friendly people who are waiting to help you. You can reach out to them by shooting them an email, or use the academic advising website ([*https://ucsc.campus.eab.com/*](https://ucsc.campus.eab.com/)) to schedule a zoom meeting with one of the advisors. College advisors are more geared to help you with your college core course, GEs, and deciding a major, and major advisors can help you pick specific courses for your major and even plan your career. Don't stress too much about which email to reach out to, though - whoever you decide to email will definitely be able to at least tell you who to get in touch with!

These are just a few of the many resources available to you as a UCSC student. I encourage you to explore the many things available to you and take full advantage of them early on! It's weird right now because we are all learning from a distance, but these offices are working hard to improve their services and make them as accessible as possible while working remotely. They are such kind people who love working with students, and they are really just waiting for you to reach out.

I also have very very very little experience with piano (played for like 2 years when I was 10). I have always wanted to take the classes required anyways so I thought it would perfect! Sadly, I looked at the entrance test for music 30A and I could only answer the first 2 questions. The rest was wayyy beyond me. If there are any music majors or minors out there, let me know if it's possible to learn the material for the test as a total noob. Or if it's even possible for someone like me to minor in music. Are the classes hard? Should I just focus on my major?

Aside from learning tons of useful and fancy skills, Formula Slug is a great way to get connected with industry professionals. We work closely with local EV companies like Tesla, Zero Motorcycles, Joby Aviation, etc... Many of our alumni have gotten hired straight out of UCSC because of their experience with Formula Slug and many of those same alumni are still active within Formula Slug to help guide new members and bring industry knowledge to our club.

If you are a UCSC undergrad who is interested in environmentalism or sustainability, I highly recommend applying to join the Campus Sustainability Council. CSC is a funding body that distributes grant money to student-run sustainability organizations at UCSC. Members attend weekly meetings, review grant proposals, and connect with other environmental organizations. I've been on the council for about a year, and it's been a really amazing opportunity to develop professional skills while getting involved in environmentalism. 

If you want to join, we're  hosting a virtual orientation from 4:00-5:30pm tomorrow (Friday October 2nd) which I highly recommend for new members. To get the zoom link, email [csc@ucsc.edu](mailto:csc@ucsc.edu)",0.16017045454545453,0.42619318181818183,ucsc

For whatever reason there isn't an option to simply export notes to PDF in the Windows 10 edition of OneNote. That being said if you open the office suite version of OneNote (AKA OneNote 365) you can export as PDF. The 365 version does a good job of keeping ""ink"" clear, but images might be lower quality and has some weird interaction with highlighter, the Win 10 version for the most part keeps both the quality of the ""ink"" and pictures (but only if you don't use highlighter in which case everything looks fuzzy for the pages that contain highlighter???). From my experience notes from ether version are cross-compatible, so try each method out and see what works best.

**Limit the length of your notes**
If you have a lot of ""ink"" on your notes, i.e. paragraphs/long notes, OneNote will start to really slow down in responsiveness in stuff like scrolling and inserting/removing space. In addition when you ""Print"" or export the document images in the document will be reduced in quality. I ended up just creating a section for each homework and using a sperate page for each problem. You can then just generate a PDF for each section and combine the PDFs together to submit.

**If you're planning on exporting avoid using the highlighters**
If you use the highlighters there are a couple of things to be aware of. If you have a document with highlighter and ""print"" with the Windows 10 version of OneNote, the outputted document will be fuzzy. OneNote 365 export actually generates a decent PDF in this situation, but as before the images come out blurry, and I've seen inconsistencies between what you seen in OneNote and what the PDF looks like. [Here's an example.](https://i.imgur.com/wXvcxNB.png) [Another.](https://i.imgur.com/f4j1RtM.png)

That's all I could really think of for now, hopefully this will help people. Maybe I'll come back and add stuff incase I think of anything else (or other people have suggestions).",0.13930555555555554,0.40980158730158733,ucsc

8667,"UCSC students who haven’t taken CSE 101, or incoming CS transfer students:",1,2020-10-08 21:36:32,11,"Beware. Don’t end up like me. I spent almost 10 hours thinking of how to do HW1 (professors Sesh) and started to code a bit, but I made almost no progress. Next day was not much better. I saw that I was in over my head, so I dropped CSE 101 and decided to prepare more and retry next semester even though it’d mean paying for a summer class to graduate on time. 

I know what I did wrong to get me in this hole:

1) I relied on libraries A LOT and never practiced implementing the data structures or algorithms in any language (I used to copy code from my Java book and submit it as my implementation in my previous class thinking it wouldn’t affect me since we had libraries). Now that I CANNOT use libraries in class, I am LOST! I read through LinkedList implementations, and they’re hard to grasp.

2) I don’t feel as comfortable with C++. Yes I learned a lot of C++ syntax over the summer (I transferred from a university that used Java), but I didn’t delve deeper into actually using the pointers like in LinkedLists, I didn’t practice command line/file stuff(I mostly know this after Sesh’s solved problem on Codio), and I realize I still missed some stuff like delete(). If you will take Tantalo for CSE 101 though, know C as good as C++!!

This made me think:
•This difficulty jump is insane; CS is not for me.
•How do I declare TIM as my major instead?
•What to do in life now? Will my parents get mad that I quit my path? Wouldn’t they be more mad seeing me try and fail?
•Maybe I can have a BS in TIM, while learning CS areas at my own pace, and become a SE without a BSCS?
•Maybe I can avoid algorithms kicking my ass by trying to be a Data Scientist?
•Learn front end instead? (Although I heard you’ll probably still be asked algorithms during interviews)
•Maybe I can fix my issues in time for next quarter and try CSE 101 next quarter instead (there is hope.. still?? BSCS possibly?? Maybe?)",-0.036956521739130443,0.5085144927536231,ucsc

8677,"Attention: DRC students, especially Dhar Spring 2020 students",1,2020-10-09 13:08:07,29,"A student has recently won a formal Student Grievance against Dhar - this means that Dhar was found to be in violation of the ADA (American with Disabilities Act) for not providing the student with the requested academic accommodations or an alternative that was granted by the DRC (Disability Resource Center).

**Details:**

The student who won the grievance filed it because Dhar ignored their DRC request for him to  share the lecture slides prior, or a sufficient alternative. This violated their ADA legal rights. 

This student never had their accommodation letter acknowledged, even after multiple attempts. Dhar continually ignored the students emails and later stated to the class that they should stop sending him DRC requests, because he was aware of their requests. 

*If you sent Dhar or any other professor a DRC accommodation request that was ignored/was not fulfilled, you absolutely have grounds to file a complaint against them with the DRC.* 

Be aware that there is a timeline on this procedure so act on this in a timely manner if you intend to do so. Timeline is listed in the link below. 

**How to file**: 

[This link](https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/student-conduct/student-handbook/pdf/110.0-policy-student-grievance.pdf) is to the Policy on Student Grievance Procedures, this will tell you how to file your own complaint. The policy under which you would be filling would be “**111.30** Discriminatory practices based upon disability, under Section 504 of the *Rehabilitation Act of 1973* or the *Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990* or under the University of California *Guidelines Applying to Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability* (*see Section 140.00*);”.

**Who Will Help:**

* If you would like to find out more about this procedure please contact your service coordinator at the DRC. (The DRC will help you write and file the complaint)
* Also contact **Isabel Dees** who is the Title IX Coordinator/Interim Associate Vice Chancellor of Equity and Equal Protection. [idees@ucsc.edu](mailto:idees@ucsc.edu)
* The student who filed the complaint is happy to supply more help/info. You can contact them via discord (**emh98**\#6273).
* The SUA VPAA can also direct you in filling out forms and starting the process ([suavpa@ucsc.edu](mailto:suavpa@ucsc.edu)) 
* As always, you can DM me/comment below for more info, any help, or to get in contact with the above people!!

**Why:**

When you write your formal student grievance PLEASE NOTE: *you can ask for whatever remedy would make you whole again*. For example, *automatically passing the class* is a possible remedy. Filing this grievance is extremely important for holding Professor Dhar and other professors accountable for their hostile and negligent behavior towards students. This is especially true when all students are asking for is the most basic of accommodations that they are entitled to during a crisis.",0.13333333333333333,0.39015151515151514,ucsc

Hi guys - back in July, I posted a survey about the coronavirus on various college subs. I got almost 500 responses and recently wrote an article summarizing the findings. There were so many excellent responses it was hard to pick which ones to highlight, but I tried my best to capture the trends I observed. Since a good chunk of the responses came from students in this sub, I thought I’d make an update post (all in all, I’d say about 25 universities had high levels of representation in the survey, so I’ll be making update posts in those particular subs).  

Thanks so much to the people in this sub who participated! This wouldn’t have been possible without the help of student redditors. If any of you have questions, feel free to PM me.

8693,Winter&amp;Spring plan,1,2020-10-09 22:47:50,2,"heyy, I am currently thinking

Winter - CSE101(James Davis), MATH23A, CSE120(Heiner Litz)

Spring - CSE130(David Harrison), CSE102, (CSE183(David Harrison)(capstone req) || CMPM120(Nathan Altice))

How is this looking? Winter is not a big problem I'm guessing. But I may find that Spring quarter is gonna be kind of hard if I take CSE183? (But I really want to take this class)

cuz next year, I would be taking

Fall - CSE103, CSE112, (CSE183(David Harrison)(capstone req) || CMPM120(Nathan Altice))

Winter - CSE180, CSE 115(Disciplinary req), CMPM163

Then I am out. Based on my composition, 3 electives per quarter seem hard or no? Very doable? Think of me as a moderate median Student (in terms of capacity, and effort&amp;concentration in a sitting)

If you don't think, is there any adjustment you recommend? Thank you.",0.012962962962962957,0.4092592592592592,ucsc

i'm not going to post meeting links here because that makes it easier for zoom-bombers. (like seriously, you have nothing better to do than come harass people?) but if you look up AA santa cruz, there's a ton of zoom meetings! if you need an in-person socially distanced meeting, i can recommend some that aren't listed on the website! 

there's a meeting of mostly UCSC students that meets tuesday nights, and this week i'll be speaking at that meeting. i'll be talking about how i realized that i was drinking alcoholically, and how my life has changed since i got sober. there's no pressure to turn your camera on or introduce yourself. again, please don't zoom-bomb because it will make me personally very sad. :(

there's plenty of other good resources out there, like [The Cove](https://shop.ucsc.edu/students-in-recovery/thecove.html) and [Party Like A Slug](https://www.instagram.com/partylikeaslug/?hl=en) for harm reduction stuff. feel free to message me with any questions you have!

8759,On Campus Living,1,2020-10-13 00:50:14,12,"What type of dystopian shit is this? Sorry for my language, but the entire situation that UCSC has created for on campus living is a complete nightmare. 

Creating a bubble of non-covid students was the intention, but after the two week quarantine? Then what. You still going to enforce social distancing when students can go... anywhere? From San Francisco to LA you can go and come back and they can’t stop you. Either that, or you interact with people in the Santa Cruz “locale”. What is the point if you’re not going to allow any social interactions besides talking over Zoom or receiving your daily rations from the dining hall? What is the point if you do tests and quarantines but then break it indefinitely?

Students who have just started living in college and have not met people besides zoom are really struggling because of the morale implications they are put in. Imagine trying to make friends with faceless neighbors(who all test negative from covid tests), not being able to interact with them besides 6ft away and your only similar background is living in such a shitty situation(people get written up for throwing frisbees 10 meters away) 

On the flip side, imagine you are immunocompromised. You isolate like your peers but once the two weeks are done... you’re fucking toast. All that time wasted in doors was useless. Everyone can go to Santa Cruz as they please, risking your own health and they could end up giving you covid through the bathroom, air vents, outside, going to dining hall, etc. Those tests? They take 24hrs to get back. 24hrs spreading the damn thing. 

Restaurants are open, people are surfing, hotels are open, but this campus has yet to make any sort of progress or any statement of what it’s attempting. Either make a complete bubble where all students are covid free, only allowed on campus with no visitors, and free interaction or have absolutely no restrictions at all. Because who in the right mind imprisons students for two weeks for absolutely nothing. “All it takes is one”. And it ain’t coming from on campus cuz everyone has been quarantined AND tested for two straight weeks.

For some context I am living off campus and I have friends living on campus. Fix your fucking system, I am deathly worried about my friends declining mental health, the social isolation they are enforced in, the covid risks from shitty rules, and the lack of any communication from the administration.",-0.000432900432900432,0.48290043290043305,ucsc

If you are a UCSC undergrad who is interested in environmentalism or sustainability, I highly recommend joining the Campus Sustainability Council. CSC is a funding body that distributes grant money to student-run sustainability organizations at UCSC. Members attend weekly meetings, review grant proposals, and connect with other environmental organizations. I've been on the council for about a year, and it's been a really amazing opportunity to develop professional skills while getting involved in environmentalism.

If you want to join, we're hosting a virtual orientation from 1:00-2:00pm tomorrow (Wednesday October 14th). To get the zoom link, email [csc@ucsc.edu](mailto:csc@ucsc.edu)

I’m currently attending a community college and I’m panicking a bit on if I meet the requirements for transferring. My overall UC transferable gpa is around a 3.3~3.4 however my gpa for the foundation courses needed to transfer is around a 2.8. I got a C in calc(ugh :( I know... I wish I withdrew and retook it) and the rest of my foundation courses are B’s. I am enrolled in data structures and calc 2, and I’m hoping for A’s but realistically I think they will be B’s. I can’t seem to get A’s in any of my foundation courses. I’m worried that by the time I have to submit apps next year, I’ll have a gpa for foundation courses that is less than 3.0. 

Basically to sum it up, how strict is that 3.0 gpa minimum?(as I have seen many other people on reddit say they were accepted with ~2.8 gpa for foundation courses) What are my chances in getting in?

Despite COVID-19, there's recently been an increased demand for legal support, which means it's finally a good time for recent grads to apply and get into entry-level positions. This is great news for those of you who are pre-law or wanting to gain experience in the legal field.

I just got a friend from high school hired at a global firm in the Financial District in less than a day. He is super thankful because he was unemployed throughout the quarantine. I'd like to help other recent grads out...since I was Class of 2019 and I can't imagine how things must be for Class of 2020 right now. 

Please DM me here and I'll send you my email for you to send over your resume. Serious candidates only. It's legit. I am just trying to think outside the box and find recent grads. A lot of them aren't actively browsing LinkedIn.

NOTE: I am a recent UC graduate. I prefer to source from the UC network. I also only staff contract positions. Perfect for those wanting to peek into the legal field.",0.11145408163265305,0.4166071428571429,ucsc

Under normal circumstances I would sign up, but I'm already enrolled in 15 credits as a Freshman and (for me at least) these are pretty intensive courses that I need to focus on. I took Chinese classes back in high school, so the class shouldn't be hard, but I feel like my schedule is already pretty packed already with my current classes, ACE, and clubs. 

And even if I decide to enroll, wouldn't I also have to catch up on 2 weeks of assignments? It just doesn't seem very intuitive for me, but the professor has already given me the permission code for her class and kinda expects me to attend. 

I have a buddy who's actually willing to help me out with the office hours if I decide to do it, but honestly at first I thought it would be only office hours, but she then just kinda roped me into it and now it's more than it seems.

8866,OFFICER + MEMBER RECRUITMENT -- Competitive Math Team at UCSC,1,2020-10-19 02:15:39,0,"Hi all,

I made a post awhile back last quarter about the Competitive Math Team (CMT) at UC Santa Cruz. We are now recognized as a student organization by the university, so we are ready to begin recruiting. 

I was surprised to find out that there isn't a competitive math club/team here at UCSC given that every other UC (except Merced) has one, and some schools such as a Berkeley and UCLA have tryouts and make it a class while it is non-existent here. 

We will be having 1-hour meetings bi-weekly via Zoom this quarter, and will look into extending it to weekly meetings for winter quarter.

**Some of the early goals of this club are to:**

**1)** Teach critical thinking techniques that are applicable outside of pure mathematics

**2)** Represent UC Santa Cruz in the global Putnam competition (**this will be the UCSC's debut!**)  More about the Putnam exam here: [https://www.maa.org/programs-and-communities/member-communities/maa-awards/putnam-competition-individual-and-team-winners](https://www.maa.org/programs-and-communities/member-communities/maa-awards/putnam-competition-individual-and-team-winners) 

**FAQ:**

\- Our events are open to the public, **not just declared math majors** 

\- You don't have to be ""good"" at math  (actually one thing we will discuss is why the phrase ""good at math"" is shortsighted)

\- You do not need prior experience with competitive mathematics

**Officers:**

I am currently looking for 5 officer positions to fill. The positions are: 

1. Director of Outreach: The Director of Outreach will be in charge of fundraising (when necessary), and communication with club members, professors, and S.O.A.R. 
2. Co-Directors of Education: The Director of Education will take charge of developing material that will be taught to the club members. Ideally, this role would best be filled by an upperclassman or a student with previous competitive mathematics experience. (3 Positions Open)
3. Director of Design: The Director of Design is responsible for developing a club website and logo. HTML/CSS proficiency is a strong plus. 

If you are interested in being an officer, please mark down your interest in the Google Form below - I will be in contact with you ASAP.

I’ve already messaged the same person who helped me, and alerted them that I added an updated picture of my immunization record to the application, but last time it took them a few days to respond (understandable).

We all go through a lot of shit in our lives, and it's super easy to feel like we're the only ones who are going through what we're going through. The fact is though that this isn't true, and there are a lot of other people who've also been through what we're currently facing, and have made it out the other side stronger. Something that helped me a lot (I've been through pretty severe depression and anxiety in the past) was the help I got from my friends at the time, even if they didn't really know exactly what to do or how to help.

We're building something to make it easier to help the people you care about in similar situations - all while being fully free!

For user testing, this will be a \~45 minute call with out Head of Product, [Chris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-robeck/), who will ask all sorts of random questions about mental health and interactions between friends, and we will compensate $10 for the call. We also have some longer term involvement options that we can touch base on at the end of the call.

If you're interested in helping out in testing, please please fill out this google form [https://forms.gle/YUWzgMkfGhtpPDjM8](https://forms.gle/YUWzgMkfGhtpPDjM8) and we'll get back to you very shortly with more information and details.

this is a long shot, but does anyone know of any other resources i could look to for a loaner laptop? i literally only need it during the time my laptop is being repaired (which may take 1-2 weeks with shipping according to the apple rep i spoke to a week ago) and it's been stressing me out that i had put off repairing it in the hopes slug support would be able to help because my laptop could have been repaired by now. it's getting later into the quarter when things are getting busy, so i was just hoping this problem could have been solved sooner rather than later :^(",0.03697916666666668,0.48773148148148154,ucsc

I'm currently a sophomore at another school (ranked \~40 - 50 by Forbes, USNews, WSJ etc., think CWRU, UW-Seattle, UIUC, UT Austin, BU etc.). 

In general, I'm struggling with classes, and feel as though I need a change of environment in order to succeed. I was wondering a few things:

1. Does UCSC have grade deflation? My  school has rampant deflation and makes it nearly impossible to maintain high grades due to brutal curving. Does UCSC have similar issues with deflation? 
2. How are premed opportunities at UCSC? The research and clinical opportunities I've had here have been crazy, and I'd hope to replicate that environment without the insane levels of stress after transferring.
3. Would you recommend UCSC for someone like me? Pre-med, struggling to handle science weeders in a competitive environment. 
4. Is it more competitive of collaborative?
5. How hard is switching majors? Outside of CS, are there any other strong majors at UCSC that are of note? Thanks!

""The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries.""

So I’m currently living on campus and when I moved in I got a router. 

My thinking was that this would give me more privacy and give me better speeds. While it’s definitely given me good speeds, I recently had an a weird encounter which makes me think I don’t have the privacy I wanted. 

I clicked on a link to a website that I’ve used before, just not on campus, and when I did the IT department intercepted it. It automatically redirected me to a page saying how the link I clicked could be dangerous. 

This what confuses me, if I had the privacy I thought I had, how were they able to know I clicked on a “suspicious link”?

If they knew I went to that site, does that mean they know all the sites I go to?

How come they’re able to see what I do, if I’m using my own router?

Disclaimer: I know the argument they don’t care or if you have nothing to hide. For me this about privacy, I don’t like the idea of what I search being available for other to see, even if it’s just mundane stuff.",0.13305555555555557,0.5686111111111111,ucsc

9053,Thoughts on Sheldon and CSE 12 overall,1,2020-11-01 20:58:51,24,"I heard that 70-80% of the students taking this class do not end up passing it. That seems a bit too much for an introductory class. Students have to let go of their dreams of being engineers and programmers just because of the unreasonable difficulty of this class paired up with the unemphatic teachers that this class has. Sheldon rarely answers questions and often just directs them to piazza or zybooks. I AM PAYING FOR THIS CLASS. This isn't the treatment I think we deserve when we are just new to the field. In the CSE 12 official discord, students were freaking out about how they couldn't get the right outputs and we were in line to get docked -40 points on top of losing points for not getting the function right. The lab document was so hard to follow and things were not explained clearly. Sheldon also mentions how there would be no partial credit because there is no partial credit in the workforce, well in the workforce if i didn't know how to solve a problem I would use the internet or ask for someone's assistance but that isn't accepted and counted as plagiarism. I would expect that the professors would be more empathetic during the time of the pandemic but his labs and tests just seem to feel like he is out to get us. 

That's pretty much my 2 cents. Is it only me or is this something everyone else is facing.

I’m taking German 1 and I want to take the whole German series all the way up to German 6. I noticed that German 1 right now is very very rushed; we learn about 10 new topics per week on our homework. I’ve talked to my classmates and we agree that we barely have enough time to process one topic before we move to the next. It seems like sometimes the topics are random and don’t really connect? And then we don’t come back to old topics until weeks later. I’m trying to understand what the rush is? If there are 6 quarters of German why are they squeezing so much into the first class? Another thing; I noticed the emphasis right now (maybe just because of the online situation) is on reading in German way more than it is on speaking German. I understand the importance of reading in the language but I really think speaking in the language should be emphasized more. Most of our assignments involve reading and writing rather than speaking. Just wondering if anyone has any insight on why German 1 is so rushed and if anyone else taking a language class rn feels there’s not enough emphasis on speaking and any guidance or tips?",0.13987892316017314,0.26169710497835497,ucsc

My professor was considering it and I emailed telling him that it would be unfair to students like me who are not interested in the election, and I believe we will be continuing as scheduled fortunately. 

I understand that there are some students who do care, but that's based on their political beliefs, and that's based on their world view. It should not affect students like me who do not need to deal with this shit, people like me who actually studied for these midterms. I do not want to postpone taking the midterm because that will only negatively affect me. 

I just hate when people want their own preferences to affect others. Like don't interfere with my learning just because of something that belongs to you.

And if you're anxious, then just take the midterm anyways. I've taken tests while distracted by other important things. Sometimes, you just have to man up and deal with it. 

We all pay for education, I should not be forced to sacrifice something which does not benefit me. /rant",-0.06095238095238095,0.6407142857142857,ucsc

I personally do not support President Aliyev's actions in Nagorno-Karabakh and I believe that Turkey's Ergodan is a corrupt leader. At the same time, I do not support the actions of Armenia in expanding the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh (as is displacing thousands of Azerbaijanis; I have family friends that were displaced from this region during the war in the 90s). Regardless of these beliefs, however, the events that are taking place in Azerbaijan right now are really hard to bear, especially because I have family in Azerbaijan who were near the attacks in/around Ganja. I don't really have anyone to talk to about this and so I am just reaching out to see if there are others (regardless of your nationality) who are also affected by the conflict.

Also, I really don't want this thread to devolve into political arguments against the actions of Armenia and Azerbaijan. Most of the news coming from the region is extremely biased (pro-Armenia or pro-Azerbaijan) and I am very sympathetic towards the Armenian perspective. I am really just having a hard time digesting what is happening, especially because I am seeing hatred against the Azerbaijani government also being directed towards the Azerbaijani people.",0.04719887955182073,0.5305322128851541,ucsc

9118,Why isn't the dining hall menu changing?,1,2020-11-06 14:19:48,24,"I asked around and here is what I found out...

But first, a request that everyone living on campus fills out the Dining Satisfaction Survey! Check your UCSC email - you should have gotten a special link on Weds 11/4. There's an open-ended comment area and that's a great place to ask for more variety and **be very specific** about the exact foods you wish Dining would serve.

okay, onward to the findings.....

\#1 simple changes are not so simple

Dining has to be very strategic in menu planning, because they need to address the Top 8 Allergens, as well as other dietary restrictions like vegan/vegetarian. So they have to plan a menu that will meet the needs of a wide variety of guests so each gets a meal that meets their dietary requirements. So an updated menu isn't just a matter of swapping out one option for another, unfortunately. Additions or changes have to be looked at holistically because of how the change will affect the nutritional make-up of the menu as a whole.

\#2 social distancing

In addition, they have to plan a menu that they can execute using the equipment at available work stations. In normal times, this requires a decent amount of planning, but in covid times this piece is *especially* challenging, since each station is designed to function independently (so that staff are social distancing and not moving from station to station). So menu items that require multiple pieces of equipment from various stations are no longer an option (reducing variety).

\#3 reliable supply of ingredients

\- Dining also wants to plan a menu that contains ingredients they know they can source without supply chain interruption (remember the toilet paper shortage - it's a similar idea - they have to choose ingredients they feel confident will remain available by suppliers).

\#4 getting your meal made faster

Then there's the important goal of getting your meal delivered quickly and on-time. In ""the before times"", they didn't have to limit the number of staff in a location, but now with social distancing they have to work with fewer staff members. And now they are cooking small batches made-to-order, so your meal is fresh and customized just for you (and to limit food waste). As the Dining staff is becoming proficient with the current recipes, they are able to produce them faster so you're more likely to be able to place your meal order for your preferred time. (Interesting statistic: During the popular meal times, Dining is producing a completed meal ready for pick-up at the rate of one every minute.)

**Thanks for coming to my TED talk :)** 

I hope this info helps.

Lastly, the Director asked me to let everyone know that Dining is continuing to work on new ideas to make the best dining experience possible, given the many operational challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic has forced upon us all. 

If everyone on campus can fill out the Dining Satisfaction Survey that will be really helpful!",0.22448439924855015,0.4575992403822592,ucsc

Hope everybody is having/has had a ""good"" midterm week. So, I'm a CS major that just transfered in. However, this quarter has been rough to say the least and it's just been really clear that I'm not motivated or interested in pursuing coding anymore. I don't want to do any type of software engineering as my career. So I'm just realizing it's kinda pointless me taking these classes at this point. 

Therefore I'm at a point now where I'm considering switching my major to TIM. A major of which is wayyy more up my alley with my strengths and interests in whole area of the intersection between tech and business.  

Of course, there's a couple of reservations:
1) I'm worried TIM isn't viewed as competitively as CS so I might have a difficult time finding as decent of a job (I know getting a job depends on a lot more than just getting a degree)
2) I kinda feel like a failure. I'm walking away from something because in part it is too challenging, usually I can use my motivation to overcome challenges but I just don't have it with these CS classes right now 
3) I have to take diff EQ for TIM and haven't taken calc in a  couple of years  
4) I would have to stay another quarter if I wanted to pursue a CS minor

If anybody out there has made the switch themselves I would be really curious to hear why. Of course, any general advice on the matter would be GREATLY appreciated. Thanks everybody (:",0.0857919254658385,0.4972049689440993,ucsc

i'm a current hs senior applying to ucsc. from what i've read/looked into so far, i feel like ucsc might be a good fit for me + my major (cognitive science- hci track) but i kind of wanted to get student perspectives as well. i have a few questions so if anyone could answer ANY of them (doesn't have to be all), it would be super helpful.

**1.** **if you're a cognitive science major, how do you like the major? if you're going down the hci track specifically, how do you like that?** (i'm kind of thinking that this would be a good fit major + track for me bcs i really love psych and i also want to learn a little bit of tech bcs i'm hoping to go into user experience and user interface design in the future)  
**2. in general, how do you guys like ucsc? is the community welcoming/warm?** i'm looking for an academically focused but also decent social life/college experience school. 

**3.** i kind of had a bad year in 10th grade and my gpa has never fully recovered from it (i'll be applying with a 3.22). my grades do show an upward trend since then though and i'll also b showing that i'm taking two classes at my local community college. with that and decent essays, **would you say that i have a chance at getting in?**

i'm sorry if this was a lot!! i've been really stressed about my applications bcs cogsci isn't offered at as many uni's and my options have become even more limited due to my gpa.

Despite being younger than my peers, I found myself doing better in classes - I often set the curves and was able to take many classes at once since computer science was never conceptually difficult to me. Unlike many others who took years to complete their degrees, I was able to do it extremely quickly finishing in my sophomore year because of how quickly I was able to absorb content.

Even before graduating high school, I was doing higher order mathematics which seemed easier than the challenge people had made it out to be. 

By the time I got my Bachelor's degree, I had already published a few research papers and had done an internship at a FAANG company, being offered a full time position after getting my Master's degree.

At the age of 20, I will walk out of here successful taking upon a high paying job. A lot of people will not have the mental capabilities to do all this, but working hard really does pay off.",0.21940476190476194,0.4950793650793649,ucsc

English major, Spanish minor

GPA from Previous institution: 3.5

General GPA: 3.23 (still have 2 semesters to improve)

Major GPA: 3.5

I have one strong lor and 2 not so strong lor which I only did well in their class 

TA'd in one of the professor's class but he's strict and said due to my GPA he couldn't write me a ""very strong"" lor. 

Did one relational database project and several small programming projects in python and java.

Will be taking a data science class and scripting language class next semester (might have more projects to do)

The Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk had to close after just one weekend of rides running again. Restaurants and gyms must decrease capacity and some businesses, like bars, have to close altogether.  
&gt;  
&gt;The county’s health officer, Dr. Gail Newel, said they’ve seen a sudden increase in coronavirus cases with active cases doubling in recent weeks. The cases are among young people and mostly stem from Halloween events. Newel urged the public to reconsider holiday travel plans and festive gatherings. The county is asking anyone who leaves the Bay Area or has contact with people from outside the community to do a voluntary 14-day quarantine. Despite this disappointing news, Newel said the good news is that hospital capacity in the county is still in good shape. There’s also a possibility, she added, that a coronavirus vaccine could arrive in the community in December. That vaccine would be prioritized for frontline healthcare workers and residents of skilled nursing facilities.

We overheard technical staff outside our apartment this afternoon working out how they might go about it. Something about leaving the existing cable in place to support TV and debating how to go through the stucco/wood, whether to drill into the units up high or down low, etc.

From the 11/16/2020 email sent to FSH residents:  


&gt;**Dear Family Student Housing Residents,**  
&gt;  
&gt;**We are excited to share that a plan to bring high speed internet to Family Student Housing (FSH) has been identified. Funds available to the campus through the CARES Act will support this project. The upgrade will bring the quality of the internet service at FSH up to the same level as the campus’s residential network internet service. It will be faster, more reliable and more secure. The work will be occurring on a rolling basis beginning Feb 1 through March 31, 2021.**     
&gt;  
&gt;**Because this upgrade will take time to fully implement, we are seeking to identify a west side location in a residence hall that would allow you and your family members to have remote work and study space that is on the campus network. You will be kept informed by FSH administration as more information becomes available regarding the location, timing and process to check out usage of the space. We anticipate it will be available in late November.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**In the coming weeks, a schedule of the building upgrades will be published on the** [**FSH Internet Upgrade project webpage**](https://ucsc.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6af7392060bf9273a90c0dd7d&amp;id=18b7bccc2a&amp;e=4f4c27a596)**. Information about the residence hall space will be shared by the FSH administration.**   
&gt;  
&gt;**Thank you for taking the time to complete the survey and for reporting your service needs. The data that you provided was immensely useful in helping us understand the scope and extent of the problems that were not adequately addressed by the hot spot installation we performed over the summer. We now have a pathway ahead that will meet everyone’s needs.**   
&gt;  
&gt;**Thank you for your patience. Please know that the campus is committed to improving this situation as quickly as possible. If we can accelerate the timeline in any way, we will.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**If you have questions, you may submit an IT Request ticket at**[ **https://itrequest.ucsc.edu**](https://ucsc.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6af7392060bf9273a90c0dd7d&amp;id=15a68d1d5b&amp;e=4f4c27a596) **or contact the ITS Support Center by email at** [**help@ucsc.edu**](mailto:help@ucsc.edu) **or call 831-459-4357.**

I'm a junior and I'm also a quarter behind in classes due to medical reasons, however, I can still catch up and graduate on time with my academic planner if I'm able to get in the classes and appeal before winter quarter. 
I had to wait to get all my paperwork and documentation from the doctors or else I wouldn't have anything give for this year as for medical history. I feared that no information could possibly damage my appeal so I waited.

The major I'm appealing for is stem related and impacted.
My GPA is above the minimum required for the declared classes and I have gone above and beyond in terms for the passion of pursuing the major with some certificates and products/projects recently as well as competitions. I also have all the documents ready, but they now closed off the appeals for this quarter.


Is it possible for me to do a late major appeal for this quarter? Or do I have to wait till next quarter? Will I still be able to take upper divisions from UCSC if the latter?

9754,Making CS Grad School Decision,1,2020-11-30 10:37:58,25,"I am a 3rd year CS student on track to graduate next Fall. However, I am currently having some difficulty deciding how to proceed with regards to the decision of potentially attending grad school. I have been very interested in research for a while and I have participated in a few labs which makes me want to consider a future career related to systems research. However, it is currently hard for me to say whether committing to a career in research is the right path for me as of now.

&amp;nbsp;

In order to help influence my decision, I was thinking of potentially applying for the 1 year master's right now (to begin Winter 2022) and then essentially graduating with a master's 1 quarter later than I would have if I completed a 4 year Bachelor's. However, I wasn't sure if this would be a worse decision than simply using the full 4 years for the Bachelor's and using the extra time to take more upper div CS classes. My rationale for attending the 1 year master's is that it would allow me to continue pursuing research more directly (such as through a master's thesis) which would help me make the decision of whether to transition to a PhD or go into industry. I could always go directly to industry after my Bachelor's finishes next Fall but I have been really nervous about this b/c I am having trouble getting an internship for next Summer.


&amp;nbsp;

I am curious to see if anyone has any opinions on this or if anyone has any suggestions for resources related to CS grad school. It's been hard trying to make this decision since a lot of the advisors that I would talk to tell me it's just up to me but I can't really tell personally which path is best-suited for me.",0.05342712842712842,0.38866041366041354,ucsc

9801,How do I get the survey prompt to go away on canvas without doing SETs?,1,2020-12-01 20:28:40,2,"TL;DR: SETs are terrible for students and we should go back to using public reviews or make SET reviews public.

&amp;#x200B;

If there is already a better way to review professors and TA's I'm all for it, let me know.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's why: About 4 years ago UCSC was promoting rate my professor which is an online service that helps students write public reviews about professors. The problem they ran into was that either 

A) bad professors would cause people to steer away from them or  

B) there wasn't enough of a distribution of reviews ie: too few reviews(they claimed that there were too many disgruntled students reviewing)

Now, we have no way to determine who is going to provide us with our money's worth. You end up with professors in physics like Dhal or professors like him who skirt by the rules just enough but have no way to be reviewed or gauged by students. We should have every right to be able to determine WHO is going to be worth our time, and our money.

&amp;#x200B;

Ratemyprofessor should be promoted again but this time with more involvement by the students. SETs do nothing, perhaps help the TA's land a job in the future but that's about it.",0.05798319327731094,0.35014005602240894,ucsc

I understand tuition prices and I have accepted that portion of it, but I really do not understand the campus fees portion of it. In this current state that we are in where most students are not going to campus for the rest of this year, why should we still have to pay almost $500 for campus fees that we will not even be utilizing? For example, a transportation fee of $136 per quarter is ridiculous to me for something that most of us are not using at all. I may be uninformed on the subject and if so I apologize in advance, but have they said anything about reducing or reimbursing any campus fees for the quarters they are closed?

9814,Can I drop a class this late? Please help me ):,1,2020-12-02 10:00:12,17,"Let me explain . I already changed my Japanese 1 class to P/NP because I knew I was going to fail a few days ago. This is a class that isn't part of my major (although I wanted it to be) but I bombed my first exam because I didn't have the proper settings on my computer to translate English letters to Japanese characters. 

This means that when I type A, it doesn't automatically change to あ. I had a completely different setting on my computer that made the 1 key the あ key so on and so forth. So you can see where that gets confusing as someone who has never taken an online class and who has never learned another language like this, right?

When I tried to explain it to my professor she just shrugged her shoulders and moved on \[makes sense it's not her problem\]. But I don't necessarily feel like it's a very fair deal since somehow everyone in my class (who took this class for fun, to understand anime, etc) already knew how to do this? This is my first online class, and I was doing well until I bombed this test and there's no way I'm able to climb back up since I'm feeling so dejected. 

Not only that, but having to come back down to my hometown and having to stay weeks longer in an unstable internet/working environment because my roommate at santa cruz might've had covid? \[he doesn't thank christ\]. Not only that– but the final is an oral presentation which is anxiety inducing in itself.

I'm just wondering if I'm able to talk to someone about this. I already know I'm not gonna pass because of something that was out of my control, am I able to e-mail someone and ask if I can just get this entire class to disappear from my life and my record since I was screwed over from the first exam? (which I got the lowest score on because of my settings). And if not, does anyone think I should just disappear from the class? I know I'm not going to pass– I already know this. Is it worth the stress to just keep going? The only reason I didn't drop sooner was because I thought I'd be able to pull through for the second exam, but you wouldn't believe how fast paced it is \[it's like I should've known Japanese before I took the class).",0.10743113912231558,0.46616479925303456,ucsc

I wish I had found it during my BA because it would have made such a huge difference. You are basically paired with an accountability partner on video chat and you share what you're working on at the start of a 50 minute session and then at the end discuss how you did. You typically mute your mic during this process but can text chat updates on the work you're doing if you want to. 

They have a group for UCSC students so they will then attempt to pair you with someone else from UCSC or who graduated from there. This only works if you sign up with your UCSC email though I think. I'd love to have more partners that also are from UCSC! I'm in another degree program now so I have been using it to get my work done.

9900,People Need To Acknowledge The Truth,1,2020-12-07 02:46:11,9," This is just a venting post. I got my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science when I was 19 years old. One thing that people always say is that I was only able to get it because “I was privileged”. 

The thing I do not like about the people who say this is that it stipulates that they have the capability to do what I did. Like, really, I’m privileged? I am sure anyone who says this is just as privileged, but they do not have what it takes to get their degree at 19 years old, and to be blunt, to be as successful as I am.

Sure, I never had to work a job in college, but something that I am 100% sure about is that the people who did work a job would still not be able to do what I did. You know why? Because I was doing higher order math even when I was in high school. By the time I was 17, I knew multivariable calculus, linear algebra, etc. I had no privilege because the classes I took were available to everybody. What’s your excuse for not being able to do this? I highly doubt you were spending your entire day in high school at your job. Oh, I guess the privileged BS no longer works now.

I started this before even college, and I was always extremely intelligent. The fact is that no matter how hard many people here try, they could never do what I could. I got my degree before they even knew what their major would be. 

It wasn’t because I was privileged -- it was because I was extraordinarily hardworking and smart, so don’t EVER act like you could even come close to achieving what I have.

9905,UPDATED: Message From Scuba Program Director On Funding,1,2020-12-07 11:51:03,3,"To Sue Harriman (Director of Athletics and Recreation),

﻿As you can witness from your INBOX, the community at large cares about the Recreational Scuba Program at UCSC. 

You have the power TO REVERSE THE DECISION BEFORE DEC. 14TH to permanently lay off me and Sloane Lofy. THERE IS MONEY IN THE PE REFERENDA ACCOUNTS TO FUND OUR POSITIONS and the other 2 Supervisors (Vicki Bergland and Yoshi Shibata). Contractual employees will not produce the same impeccable safety records and the same depth/breadth of results. 

Instead of having a surplus of many thousands of dollars in the PE Referenda accounts, please use the PE Referenda money for what it's intended as written in Measures 32 and 64. There is money there because:
- these PE positions were never replaced: Cindy Mori, Julie Kimball, Lisa Norris, etc.
- students are paying $12.50 per quarter for PE courses

This is a simple solution to keep us on until income can be generated again. Mine and Sloane's employment can be justified with online training to stay current with my certifications (diving, safety, First Aid, CPR), preparing to offer online and in-person courses (like Humboldt State University is doing), administrative tasks to update, and a Dive Locker full of equipment to maintain, to name a few. Preserving programs of the highest standards is much better than starting over and losing over 70 years of combined institutional knowledge of the beloved PE Supervisors.

Sincerely,
Cecilia Shin

I would like to hang out with my friends once we move in to campus. Obviously, we will be safe, wearing masks and getting tested as required.

I am a prospective transfer majoring in anthro, I TAGed from a bay area CC and I'm wondering how the Anthro department is at UCSC? At my CC I also took a bunch of poli sci classes and competed on the speech and debate team, I'm looking to see if UCSC has any competitive debate teams or mock trials/MUN. I really enjoy academic competitions or just any way I can actually apply my major to extra curriculurs.

 Also how difficult is it to double major? I am graduating with two AA's one in Anthro and the other in Poli Sci so I assume my lower divison req's are fulfilled.

This is just artificial difficulty to ensure people do worse even if they understand the content of the class, and doesn't actually do anything to stop cheaters. This is pathetic. This administration obviously cares more about lining their pockets and the school's image than the students. They charge full price of admission for some weekly zoom lectures, and then have the gall to complain that the students are doing too well? I guess keeping the failure rate high to appear elite is more important than actually helping your students during a pandemic.

Hey guys, I am a hyper-intelligent student who wanted to share my experience in Computer Science, and how I was able to get my phD at the age of 16. I had never been particularly ""privileged"". I had went to a normal high school, but I quickly excelled in my classes, above all other students. I scored extremely high on math competitions and was considered gifted.

I was able to take higher order math classes during high school, finishing the math series and auditing advanced classes at colleges. I did not necessarily have any ""advantages"" besides my own intelligence. I came from a normal high school, but it was my own merit which got me far. But it wasn't just my intelligence - it was my hardworking capability.

Anyways, I hope someone finds this inspiring because it shows that you can be successful like me and don't need to spend 4 years in college like most ""average"" people. You don't need wealth or anything, just the character.",0.27673913043478254,0.6507971014492753,ucsc

Im at UCSC  as a senior with good grades majoring in CSBS. My delimena is that I can use the next 6 months, starting as of December 2020, of school to leetcode and build projects but in doing so I would miss out on CSE 112 which is with Mackey Comparative programming. Making it 1 class short from a BS. However, I don't think its that important from BA vs BS. I took all the math,  Computer Architecture, Principles of Computer Systems and Design ( equiv to Operating Sys CMPS 111), and did well. So point in being is I want a Software Engineer job coming out of college on day 1, and if I can milk the last 6 months with LeetCode and build some amazing stuff to put on a portfolio, that would way more than the BS with no projects and rusty ass skills out of UNI. Now some insights about my situation. Im dirt poor and live in a really bad neighborhood, I want out, and second my multi tasking skills sucks ass and I take Adderall for treatment  ( prescribed). In the end I love to code, but I'm a person that needs to concentrate on 1 thing at a time. I was planning on just doing backend web projects,leet code, interview prep. This approach works for me well and when I do this I retain the knowledge permanently. I m good at cramming and passing but ask me tomorrow how I got that A/B or formula and I'll blank ouy. Also I might not be able to secure housing after those 6 months, and if I do it won't be more than 3-4 months. All perspectives are welcomed, CSBA's are you employed with a tech job and was it hard? Thanks my gente! BTW I am taking  cse 102 this Spring but I think that's relevant to the leetcode and will help immensely. 2 birds 1 stone",0.16227904040404043,0.4624999999999999,ucsc

10044,UPDATE: Scuba Program Restructuring - Response from Dir. Harriman &amp; My Thoughts,1,2020-12-13 16:05:06,6,"Athletics &amp; Recreation Director Sue Harriman has been responding to concerned students, alumni, and faculty about her proposed gutting of the Recreational Scuba Program at UCSC with the following message. I have responded myself with how her reply is unsatisfactory and factually untrue in several manners. That can be found after her message.

&gt;  Thank you for your email. Our Physical Education courses are a critical component of the transformational experience we offer our students at UC Santa Cruz. Over the last few days, many of you took the time to write to me and campus leadership to share the positive ways that our programs have impacted you. Your stories confirm how important these programs are to our students and their development.  

&gt; I want to reiterate that our P.E. classes, including scuba diving, are not being cut from the programs that we offer to our students. Our Adventure Recreation classes and workshops, including CPR and First Aid, and our equipment lending and rental programs are also not being eliminated.  We will continue to offer these courses, programs, services and more in the coming year because we know how valuable these experiences are for students and how they can be springboards to an active lifestyle and career opportunities for our alumni.

&gt; The P.E. courses, along with some of the Adventure Recreation classes and workshops, have been undergoing a review over the past year and a half. Through that time, several opportunities for programmatic adjustments have emerged that will help us better meet growing student demand and support student success. These examples include:

&gt; • Offering P.E. courses and Adventure Recreation classes and workshops over the summer to expand access and opportunity for participation; 

&gt; • Changing the P.E. course model so that courses will be eligible for academic credit;

&gt; • Limiting the number of times a P.E. course can be repeated to provide broader access to students who have not been able to participate;

&gt; • Ensuring that all P.E. courses are taught with clearly defined learning outcomes and a syllabus outlining the progressive nature of the curriculum;

&gt; • Reducing duplication between P.E. courses, Fitness programming, and Adventure Recreation to maximize existing resources and their positive impact on our students.

&gt; In order to achieve these goals there will be some adjustments to the operating model and instructor appointment process.

&gt; Let me close by reiterating how grateful I am that you shared your story and to affirm that the programs you care so deeply about continue to be a priority for me and the campus leadership team. 

&gt; Sincerely,

&gt; Susan Harriman
&gt; Director Athletics and Recreation

My response to Director Harriman and that I want to clarify for students and faculty who may not be familiar with scuba courses and training is that many of Director Harriman's points are flatly irrelevant and others are incorrect. 

To start with, Scuba courses cannot be repeated because each course culminates in a certification that is earned for life. A basic scuba course graduate receives a basic diver (open water) certification. Once this certification is earned, it cannot be revoked and so there is no likelihood of students repeating or needing to retake courses. If an open water diver wants to advance their training they would move on to the advanced course. Advanced divers would move on to the rescue level course, and so on. If certified divers want to refresh training, they would not retake the 10 week course- instead they would take a refresher taught by a dive professional. These are often one-on-one, single day courses. 

Scuba courses also already have a a syllabus and course requirements. There are in fact several agencies and institutions that implement and oversee learning goals, course syllabus, and progression in the UCSC diving community. The first is NAUI, the agency which UCSC divers are certified under. NAUI courses all have standards and requirements for students. This information can be found [here.](https://www.naui.org/certifications/training-progression/) UCSC's diving program is further overseen by the University's Diving Safety Officer and Diving Control Board. These positions are populated by trained dive professionals and safety personnel who dictate requirements for UCSC divers both recreational and scientific. Some of this information can be found in UCSC's Diving Manual [here.](https://www2.ucsc.edu/sci-diving/pdf/divemanual.pdf) 

I fail to see how SCUBA diving is similar to any other recreational or athletic programs UCSC currently offers. The only other programs that are remotely similar could be swimming, kayaking, and sailing. Only because these activities and sports also take place in water but ultimately these activities are as similar to as a frog and a fish- both may be found in a pond, but it would be laughable to call them the same.

For the first two points, it is important to point out that while these goals are admirable and applicable to scuba, Recreational Scuba Director Cecil Shin (who has been terminated) has been attempting to achieve these goals for years. I fail to see who terminating her would invigorate goals she has been championing for years.

On a final note, Sue has indicated that she is attempting to restructure the entire Recreational Scuba Program by Spring of 2021. It is important to note that Sue is no a professional diver, nor did she contact UCSC's Diving Control Board or the Diving Safety Officer. It seems quite clear to me (both as a concerned alumni and dive professional) that making vast decisions about diving programs at UCSC without consulting or even contacting the diving safety personnel and oversight committees at the University opens UCSC to immense liability and worst may endanger current and future students who wish to explore the ocean.

Apologies for the long post, write-up, and ranting but again as an alumni of this program and a dive professional I think it's my duty to current students to inform you if I think admin may be making decisions that could negatively impact YOUR safety or the safety for future slugs. 

If this upsets you please don't hesitate to sign a petition for the University to reverse its decision and Save Scuba Slugs [here](https://www.change.org/p/university-of-california-santa-cruz-save-the-ucsc-scuba-program-b9067703-ba18-49ef-9413-4175c1bc77f6?redirect=false)!

10047,Premed? Or questions about medical school? I may be able to help. MD student and UCSC graduate,1,2020-12-13 19:41:04,26,"Hi everyone. I've made a post like this about once a year since graduating UCSC in 2016 as I just want to offer any help I can to people considering medical school. I am currently a 4th year MD student (in the US). 

I'll post some frequently asked questions since they usually come up, and happy to respond to things here or by direct messaging. 

**Frequently Asked Questions**

* What was your GPA/MCAT? - 3.85 and a 35 (~517 on new exam)
* Where do I get clinical experience in Santa Cruz? - Dominican hospital and Sutter take volunteers (I'm sure others do too), but it can be hard to get a spot. Consider EMT, scribe work, or medical assistant work. Salinas isn't too far south, and if you're willing to go over the hill San Jose may offer opportunities. Other volunteering activities may satisfy your clinical exposure/experience needs as well!
* Does my major matter to med schools? - No it does not. You do not need a science major (about 40% of med students were non-science majors). The perceived difficulty of your major is also meaningless (high GPA with easy major beats lower GPA with a ""hard"" major every time)
* How hard is it to stay in California for med school? - Very hard. We send about 2/3rds of our medical students out of state. There are very few CA spots compared to CA applicants. But other states are cool too!
* Do I need shadowing? - Shadowing is a mixed bag, but yes you should shadow. Some people consider it worthless while others highly valuable or even required. You should do some shadowing, but it should not be the significant part of your clinical experience.",0.018766069788797055,0.5163919498010408,ucsc

10051,My experience at UCSC,1,2020-12-13 23:17:09,0,"I attended UCSC back in 2015 on a wrestling scholarship. That is until they shut down the wrestling program because the coaches kept banging all the kids. But hey that happens everywhere that's not just a UCSC thing. Unfortunately it also meant I was stuck taking normal classes and trying to keep my GPA up WITHOUT being a star athlete. And man those classes were so weird. My Civics teacher kept showing me cartoon frogs and complaining about freedom of speech anytime a student asked him to put his dick away. I took a film studies class but every week my libertarian teacher just played Fight Club and tried to explain why cryptocurrency is safer than the stock market. I still remember my first kiss at Porter, right next to the beautiful squiggle with a vibrant red providing the slightest hint of social commentary. One time I aced a test just by writing ""I don't like big government"" for every answer. My favorite memory has to be when we had that huge wildcat strike that got so out of hand they had to call the police which did end the rally but only because the entire grad student body also consisted of police officers. They say your college years are how you shape the rest of your life. After my time at UCSC, I'd have to say the rest of my life is shaped like Ronald Reagan's dangling, flaccid penis as he wanders the hall of the White House in confusion, talking to paintings and leaving a trail of piss wherever he goes until he can be wrangled back into his chair and forced to sign whatever bill puts more black people in prison.

&gt;Organized by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA), #SavePublicTransit Day will shine the light on the dire financial crisis facing the public transportation industry and urge elected officials to take immediate action.  
&gt;  
&gt;This campaign urges Congress to move forward and provide emergency funding for public transit in the lame duck session before Congress recesses for the holiday. The industry is calling on Congress and the Administration to provide at least $32 billion in emergency funding to ensure that public transit agencies can survive and help our communities and nation recover from the economic fallout of the pandemic.  
&gt;  
&gt;Please join us Tuesday, December 15 in helping spread the word and post [\#SavePublicTransit](https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDAsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMDEyMTQuMzIwMjU2NzEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5mYWNlYm9vay5jb20vaGFzaHRhZy9zYXZlcHVibGljdHJhbnNpdD9fX2VlcF9fPTYmX19jZnRfXyU1QjAlNUQ9QVpYb2tKdWVOeDFULWVneVR2eGhHQjZqenNxazl4Y3dLY1ZYWGRDSUdJZ0lsZll4dzQ0dVlXekhoNGN0QkNPYlBZcFJ2VzFHcWFhUXRzWFlIRjFlVTdxcElnNmNTOExiM2VycHBIUDExX0VnLXE3OV93aGZoQmI4Q1hrMmJyYVctR1R1R2VrWV9kZm1hbnVSeFlzRy1aaHBETlp4bjhlRXVnVGFGQWJKSzhzWXFVd09FVjlxVWJaelFscjFpMXBBNUhzJl9fdG5fXz0qTkstUiJ9.7E1WrkNXo5L8hGa-R21pFttKV0teU71cKY3OTuqM890/s/1008937559/br/91817490643-l) to show your support for public transportation.

I'll start with Professor Tamkun. He's a real example of a professor who goes the extra mile to make sure his students stay engaged with the material and he was very adaptable in order to lessen the impact that current events had on our academic performance. The class was not easy, but I genuinely feel that I had an experience in online BIO 20A that was comparable to the in-person class, which I can't say for some other classes that have switched to an online format.

10072,Earth Science Community or ENVS-ecology-esque students--Recommended Classes,1,2020-12-14 21:42:57,1,"Friends,

I have been swamped this quarter with project after project. Are there upper division courses that are mostly tests or are less work/easy-ish/enjoyable, or professors you liked.  I usually don't mind difficulty, but I think with online courses I have adapted worse than other people so I kinda need that easy boost to balance it out. and I have a job and should dedicate more time to that.

I want to take Hydrology next quarter, but there is a lab and a weekly problem set. That sounds like a lot of work--someone let me know if you've taken it or have friends who did, but lol it used to always be at 8am so probably not that many people.

I'm signed up for Coastal Geology with Gary Griggs and I know that other people and I only have good things to say about him

I don't really want to get into it because it's not really relevant, but I basically need a philosophy lower-div class offered in Spring. According to the philosophy departments published plan (subject to change) the 2 lower-div classes offered in Spring are PHIL 11 - Introduction to Philosophy taught by M. Imaz-Sheinbaum and PHIL 27 - Business Ethics taught by K. Robertson.

I'm just a really indecisive person and wanted to probe the subreddit for people who may have taken one or both of these classes and their opinions on them or the professors. 

These will be my first philosophy classes outside of STEV core. This might be controversial on this sub, but I'm more of a moderate, maybe center-right politically and my experiences taking classes at UCSC is that classes can kinda be hit or miss for whether they're full of political bias or not. Of course everyone has political bias, professors included, but I've experienced some professors who let that influence their teaching maybe a little too much. I enjoy taking interesting classes that can challenge my beliefs, but there's a difference between challenging a belief and forcing a belief onto someone. Do you think that one of these classes/profs would be more prone to heavy political bias more than the other? Let me know what you guys think. Thanks!",0.1848333333333333,0.4236666666666666,ucsc

I was younger in my dream, maybe like 15. I was rushing towards a playground with a couple other kids I didn’t recognize from my waking life. Suddenly everyone was pointing and yelling that there was someone already at the playground. I remember stopping and focusing in on something hanging off the fence near this playground. It was someone in a husky style furry costume. Pls I don’t know why I would dream that, I literally know nothing about furry culture. I literally never had a fear of them until this dream.
Anyways, we freak out and rush back into this building that’s near the playground. There, we all ran to the basement of the building. For some reason there’s even more people there and the space is built like a locker room. So, we’re hiding, I’m locking doors and turning lights off. 
However, there’s these girls that just won’t shut up and I’m afraid of being caught. Suddenly, there’s a shadow, and someone points, calling my attention, asking me if that’s him. I look to the wall and sure enough there’s a shadow, but of a bunny ear. I turn and behind these girls there’s this person in a messed up grey bunny costume. Like compared to what I had seen earlier this thing was beat. 
I then remember running to the opposite side of the room and rushing out this door. However, it’s like I can’t escape cause this guy is literally everywhere I go. Following me slowly with a crooked looking knife. 
It’s not until I start panicking that I tell myself in my dream it’s fake that everything distorts, and I force myself awake. 

So google doesn’t have a dream meaning for furries, but if anyone has any ideas??? Thx and pls I swear I’m not joking this dream freaked me out for no reason.",-0.026041666666666668,0.440162037037037,ucsc

Also 19B felt like it had harder topics and went at a quicker pace after the midterm. Is the same true of 23A?

[https://youtu.be/PohWI97qP0Y](https://youtu.be/PohWI97qP0Y)

I started a new project titled “just your existence is enough” (link above). Having battled a nasty case of depression my whole life and purposefully overdosing in march due to psych meds making me crazy lol, i figured its time we stop being afraid and speak up. As an engineer, I took an oath to “ practice integrity and fair dealing, tolerance and respect, and to uphold devotion to the standards and the dignity of my profession, conscious always that my skill carries with it the obligation to serve humanity by making the best use of Earth's precious wealth” and I intend on living up to it. I figure the best way to give back to my community is by sharing topics I learned in engineering school in a fun and educational way and to show others how engineering principles not only apply to the physical world but to our inner world and wellbeing as well. I would greatly appreciate if you can listen to this podcast thingy and let me know your thoughts, opinions, ideas. if you disagree with anything that I say, that is okay! do not be negative or leave a hate comment. Instead explain to me why you do not agree so I can better understand you. Remember we all perceive reality a bit differently, so while you may not understand my personal struggles because you did not struggle with the same things, we all struggle in one way or another.

Resources: If you are unable to seek help from a professional or too nervous at this time, below are resources that should guide the healing process. Remember there is nothing wrong with going to therapy! 

Feeling Good by David Burns: [https://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-N...](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFeeling-Good-New-Mood-Therapy%2Fdp%2F0380810336&amp;event=video_description&amp;v=PohWI97qP0Y&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqblFMLXB2akpDN1dhckRSbFFLU0dQVkFJeW11QXxBQ3Jtc0ttcDRaTGU2ZEZfRUZwOUNTZ01FMndGVW5RVkg4LXlyMVQ5eHZTbl9YZWFMOHdoU3hvb1JIclNjaVdRYXh6U0RlTEFEVDRzUHJ2ZS11UXRDOEVQc0E0cXlmUURGc29YZkpDZEFHTDdRRzN6TnVSeGlZbw%3D%3D) Scientifically backed ways to out train the negative thinking, depression and anxiety. This book served me wonders in addition to therapy. What science shows is if you dedicate \~3 months to processing the pain and healing, a lot of the depression and anxiety can go away. The main point being you do it now rather than later so when tough events happen later in life, we know how to properly deal. 

The Holistic Psychologist: [https://www.youtube.com/c/TheHolistic...](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheHolisticPsychologist/featured) she explains how events shape us, attachment theory, letting go of the past, etc in a productive and helpful manner 

Andrew Solomon Ted Talk: [https://youtu.be/-eBUcBfkVCo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eBUcBfkVCo) \- goes over his own battle with depression and the correlation between adverse experiences and mental health 

And lastly: If you are currently struggling, just remember, you keeping yourself alive is winning because that is by far the hardest thing to do when you are in a dark place. Even if you struggle to get out of bed, shower, or eat, you are still alive and that is all that matters. Please put your wellbeing first and learn how to make yourself a priority. During the rough times, someone very dear to me would remind me that “this too shall pass” and I pass that message along to you. Feel free to share this or the resources with your family and loved ones! Start spreading it around!!! We can and will get better if we put our minds to it❤️",0.05929554162312784,0.502254067771309,ucsc

Currently I’m signed up for Math 105a, and 134. I’m trying to declare into computational math so I need to finish up the differential equations requirement. I see that Math 106 is only taught during winter and summer. 

I hear math 105a can be difficult and I don’t know anything about there difficulty if 134 so I hope maybe someone can chime in. I was originally hoping to use this summer to knock out some GE’s at CC, so I’d like to avoid taking classes at UCSC, but that would mean taking math 106, alongside 105a and 134. Is that manageable or am I signing up to do bad?

This past quarter I managed to take math 111a, 110, and 23B, but found it pretty difficult to manage them all. Admittedly I wasn’t so on it with keeping up with lectures, but still managed to do decent to good on the classes. 

I’ve slowly been improving with how I manage everything now that it’s online, but I hear 105a is up there in difficulty with 111a and 106 being really hard.

I'm a new transfer student to UCSC, my first quarter will be this coming winter 2021 quarter. I'm an Econ major (Plan to take the accounting focus). This is my first Reddit post ever, even though I've been on Reddit for ""I can't even remember anymore"" now. I'm looking to make some friends/""acquaintances"" to get some semblance of a college social experience. I'm not living on-campus most likely until on-campus classes begin most likely. I guess I'll just start this (heh, as if the post wasn't long enough already) with some stuff about myself.

I'm 24 years old, male, and like to play video games, read novels, and love to cook/learn about cooking even though it's been a while since I cooked myself. I think cat pic's are dope but I'm more of a dog person in the end. Also, I'm kind of an introvert, as can be made known by the fact that this post has been 4 days in the making, don't ask me why, I don't know either man. 

If anyone here is in a similar major, or are taking the same classes, hit me up! I'm taking AM 11B with Katznelson, COWL 52 with Kelly, and PHIL 22 with Robertson. 

P.S: If there are any discord groups for those classes and/or the major can anyone let me know? I'm kind of trying to put myself out there more to not be as introverted.

I'm not even that interested in Jazz, which I guess was something I should've thought of first, but I wanted to finish the CC GE this quarter and Music 81C wasn't available.

He has a 2.2/5 for 80 reviews on RMP, and although he seems established as a musician, I'm now wary about his course because of the descriptions of it being strenuous and disorganized.

I'm gonna have to rethink a lot because it was difficult to conjure up three classes that were available for me this quarter that suited the path I'm taking, and I'm probably gonna have to switch out of this one, of which I don't know the window of time to do so, and rethink my game plan.

Hopefully I'm overreacting, to be honest.

Remember to do your due diligence in background-checking your future classes.

I always thought I'd want to go to law school, but I'm a paralegal currently and I hate my fucking life. Now I'm considering grad programs instead and I miss UCSC so much, I'll probably apply to UCSC next year for some sort of PhD program. I was thinking Psych (especially the social policy specialization) but it seems like they prefer people with psych BA's. The Sociology department looks neat (and, of course, so does the Politics department) but I feel like those are such career dead-ends. That's why I always loved the idea of law school because of the guaranteed career path afterwards. To an extension it's the same with Psych, since you could be a therapist (with certain degrees) or a counselor at a school or something.

Anyway, I'm rambling, but I guess I'd love to hear from any PhD students in the humanities or fields similar to the one's I've mentioned. How did you begin to chose which department to apply to? Can you apply to multiple departments? How many schools did you apply to? I'm realizing PhD's are crazy competitive, like Sociology only accepts 5-7 people out of 110 or so applications. What was your GPA/GRE? I graduated with a 3.5, is that even somewhat competitive?  With law school, a high LSAT can sort of counteract a ""low"" GPA, is it the same with the GRE?

It's very jarring because I've been researching law school since I was literally 12, and now I'm realizing it's just not for me. I know literally nothing about PhD admissions, so if anyone has any advice I'd love to hear it!!",0.056037784679089035,0.4620910973084887,ucsc

10426,pseudo -asynchronous courses are frustrating me,1,2021-01-04 07:44:04,29,"this is a rant about asynchronous courses that weren't labeled as asynchronous during enrollment and have course times, but professors decide to upload lecture videos instead of live course meetings...

I have 3 pseduo-asynchronous courses and all of them explained I should watch lecture videos and *during assigned lecture time* come to OH with any course content questions. I'm just having a hard time seeing how I can come to lecture time with course content questions if I'm expected to learn lecture content in that designated time. This adds an implied demand to now watch lecture videos outside of enrolled course time when students designates a class schedules for a reason. if I want professor support in lecture material I have to either make an appointment or make sure I set aside other time to watch lecture videos. I made my school schedule specific for my work/volunteer schedule, I already know I can't watch all of my lectures before the assigned course time so no OH unless by appt. 

bc we are online it seems these professors are assuming we can all engage anywhere anytime, but the scale of perceived accessibility needs to be toned down. just bc we're online doesn't mean we don't still have schedules and plan our courses around that! 

ik the easiest solution is to email for OH and stick to my original plan, but it sucks not being able to attend an easily accessible OH and it's frustrating being pressured to watch a majority of lecture content outside of scheduled time. 

it seems like this is clearly unfair and I wanted to see if anyone else has similar feelings?",-0.022146093285799168,0.48570261437908496,ucsc

10482,Advice about utilizing campus resources (from a recent grad),1,2021-01-05 01:54:29,1,"I noticed a lot of freshman tend to be worried about how to communicate with professors or if they should use some resource like Slug Support etc. Let me just say— school is SO much easier when you use every resource that you can.

For some reason high school makes professors sound super intimidating. Maybe they are at other schools, but UCSC is so relaxed you literally don’t need to worry. Your professors are a tool to help you! 

If you don’t know how to ask something or if you don’t know if you should go to office hours or if you need an extension for a paper but you’re scared— just email them and explain. I used to get so scared to ask for an extension thinking the professor would think I’m dumb or not being responsible with my time, and literally the worst that can happen is they say no and you’re back to the same deadline you started with. So just ask! 

Same with office hours/sections. At the time I was like “gross, more school” or “but what if it’s awkward”. Then junior year when I finally started going to office hours my grades improved DRAMATICALLY, like from a 2.7 to a 3.5. They research these topics for years, they want to talk about them! They’ll look over your paper or explain things, it’s so beyond helpful. If you’re really struggling in a class you can even ask to attend sections that you’re not enrolled in. I was taking Phonology, which is fun at first but like 4 weeks in you’re basically doing math to translate languages or some shit, and a lot of students lose momentum and fail in the last few weeks. I went to sections with 2 TA’s and office hours with 2 TA’s and was able to pass with a B+. Or I took some dumb ass science class (I am not a science person at all) and literally went to every single TAs office hours just to complete the homework, I spent like 8 hours a week in their office hours, and I would have failed if I hadn’t done that. 

Same goes for non-academic resources like Slug Support, the food pantries, or the DRC. Repeat after me: the school makes a fuckton of money, they take a fuckton of YOUR money, so you can use any resource that you want to use. Don’t feel bad about someone else needing it more than you. Slug Support usually has an application process, the food pantries actually get MORE funding when more students use them, and the DRC is not scary at all. Honestly, same goes for the health center. I don’t know how useful they are currently since everything’s virtual, but if you don’t have UCSHIP all they do is charge $150 for CruzCare to your account and not only are you covered for the rest of the quarter, but you can get x-rays or blood tests or anything done for no cost after the $150.

Anyway, I just wanted to post this because school is honestly so much easier when you’re not worried about doing these things!",0.007515589569161001,0.39494331065759636,ucsc

The reading assignments for my social science classes this quarter look entirely out of reach to me. Last quarter was a little rough but these classes are on another level. Between all three of my classes, we're talking several hundred pages nightly. I don't know how to go about reading that much. 

I'm open to ideas on this because I'm not sure what to think.

* How much of this is that I'm too slow or distracted of a reader? 
* How much of this is that I technically shouldn't have other life obligations like a job while doing full-time school, but I do anyway because I have to? 
* How much is that I need to learn how to skim? 
* How much of it is that the reading assignments actually are unreasonable and it's not just my imagination? 
* How much of it is that I need let some things go, accept not getting it all done, and prioritize?

I'm sure there's some kind of lesson I need to take from this, and I'm trying to figure out what it is. I'm someone who loves learning and academics, and I love my major - and it makes me really sad to to miss out on so much even if I'm able to get by gradewise without doing a lot of it.

Sue's plan to hire back instructors on an as needed basis is idiotic and short sighted.  Most if not all of these instructors will not return and the courses WILL BE WORSE.  Particularly in the case of scuba, safety will become a huge concern as the dive safety officer was completely left out of the decision making process.

10667,Winter Quarter January 16th Housing Move-In Cancelled,1,2021-01-12 18:19:51,7,"So UCSC just announced everyone scheduled to move-in on January 16th is no longer allowed to due to the COVID surge, telling students move-in may occur in late Winter or early Spring.

That's a bit tough considering, only 72 hours in advance, everyone who bought supplies for their apartments, booked flights, planned road trips, and packed for move-out is now depressingly stuck at home for another 3 months.

I understand a further surge in the pandemic needs to be stopped, however, moving students into campus honestly makes both them (and their families) safer. The campus is an extremely safe place to be, and there's almost 0 interaction between students here aside from roommates.

Students living at home means they may expose their elderly parents, while living in a campus apartment means possibly exposing people with a far lower risk. Considering everything on campus is locked down so hard, however, including deconstructed outdoor volleyball courts and scheduled, to-go dining hall meals, it's no surprise there's only been a dozen cases among on-campus residents.

It just doesn't make sense to me why they are taking this step- while it makes the University look better to have fewer cases, this isn't reducing overall cases in the state... It's simply keeping them out &amp; away, in the surge-centers of LA &amp; San Joaquin, in more densely-packed homes with more vulnerable people.

Next quarter I'm taking metx 135 and the lab, so would that be too hard with physiology? I don't want to screw myself for next quarter and make it super hard.

I’m applying for a Psychology major with undeclared as my backup. My gpa is a 3.58 (3.5 UC gpa) with a strong upward trend. My sophomore year grades were very lackluster (nearly all Bs with a couple high C+s) due to my mom being diagnosed with breast cancer and my bus ride to school lasting an upwards of four hours round-trip (both of these didn’t exactly do wonders for my mental health). Over that following summer I had a life-changing experience while living on the streets of Skid Row for a week for a service project, which I talked about in my essays. Since then, however, I’ve gotten nearly all As with a couple high Bs sprinkled in there. I explained my situation in the additional comments section, so I really hope it gets taken into consideration! And, if it even matters, my SAT was a 1370. I have a lot of volunteer experience which I talked about in my activities section and in one of my essays. I participated in freshman cross country, but had a serious injury when starting my second season, so I took up mountain biking and joined a league instead. Also I’m a pretty involved member of my school’s cyber security club.

UCSC VIRTUAL **INTRO TO E-BIKES WORKSHOP** 

Wednesday, January 20th Noon – 1pm 

[Register here](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_uVyRn2RyRgaGFHLyNi2Y_w) 

[Aventon e-bikes start around $1100](https://preview.redd.it/wxyo6l3i2lb61.jpg?width=867&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78b1ae25fd2d91e27e7c9e31c2594b28b17e5ef4)

E-bikes have been a game-changer for many people; flattening hills and making biking longer distances fun, fast, and convenient.  

Maybe you’ve thought about biking to class or to work, but you’re concerned about hills or the distance. Perhaps you would love to ride, but you don’t feel you have the time or the energy.  

From hauling gear and groceries, to arriving to class or work sweat-free, this workshop will explore e-bike options for a diversity of budgets and lifestyles. 

What Slugs are saying about e-bikes: 

&gt;*“I love that I don't have to worry about the hills, especially the huge hill up to* *UCSC. On a regular bike it took me almost an hour to bike to campus. With the e-bike it takes less than 30 minutes.”*   
– Evin K, Humanities   


Ecology Action staff will provide an overview introduction of e-bikes. Topics will include:  

* Frequently asked questions 
* Different e-bike technologies 
* Hub drive vs. mid drive motors 
* Costs, financing, and affordable e-bikes (they exist!)
* Environmental benefits 
* E-bikes, hauling your stuff, and running errands

We'll also dive into the question on everyone's mind: “Are e-bikes cheating?” Spoiler alert: the research says nope.

10722,Understanding withdrawing from a class.,1,2021-01-16 12:51:34,7,"So I've read up on the subject, but I just wanna double-check.

I'm currently taking 16 credits, two major courses, and a GE. I'm also working close to 40 hours a week at the moment (hardware and software eng).

I've been thinking since the quarter started about dropping my GE, because, honestly, with my current schedule and class load, I can't reasonably work this much and take three classes at the same time. I'm not going to try to work less as I'm making good money and I'm needed in this position. The job ends around the end of this quarter and there is still quite a lot of work to do.

The problem is, if I drop the GE, I am at 11 credits (not full time). So my current plan is to change the grading scheme to P/NP and drop it after the 25th which I believe would turn the class into a withdrawal, while still technically taking &gt; 12 credits.

So basically about two years ago I was sitting on a bench waiting for my fem studies class to start in front of the humanities lecture hall. This guy (22-ish?) came up to me with a video camera saying he was doing a project for some kind of film class and asked me if he could interview me. I said yes (maybe I was too trusting at the time) and he started asking questions. They started off somewhat normal and mainly revolved around the topic of dating (what apps do you or your friends use, is it ethical for a guy to cheat on a girl) but then the questions started to get more intrusive. Please don’t yell at me in the comments I know I should’ve left when he started asking these weird questions but I have chronic anxiety &amp; for some reason felt trapped in the conversation at the time. Anyways the questions got really personal (would you hook up with someone with an uncircumcised pen*s, talking about how women cheated on men way more often than vice versa, do I have one night stands etc). Despite his persistence. I kept saying I wasn’t comfortable talking about these things so he finally ended up leaving at some point. I still think about this interview and am really upset that it was all filmed and that I didn’t leave when things started to get weird. I’m worried that this guy was actually just a creepy trying to ask me weirdly sexual questions. Anyways I was wondering if anyone else had a similar experience with this guy?

1. I know rankings aren't everything, but UCSC dropped a lot last year on major rankings (now 97 on US News and 250 on WSJ (which includes LAC's)). Is there any particular reason for the drop? Was there any change in academic quality/student opportunities? Did any departments decline in quality?  
2. Are there volunteering/shadowing opportunities on/near campus?
3. Are there good opportunities to do research as an undergrad at UCSC? 
4. Is there significant grade deflation? Most other good public universities I looked at like UCSD, UT Austin, GA Tech and UW Seattle are notorious for grade deflation, curves, and general academic competition. Is this true of UCSC as well?

I just needed a place to vent, so bare with me. 

I’m currently a senior in the Chemistry BS - Biochemistry concentration program. To fulfill our comprehensive and DC requirements, we need to take BIOC 110L in the spring of our senior year to graduate. Unlike normal Chem BS and BMB majors, we don’t have a choice on what lab we want to take to satisfy this requirement. I emailed my advisor asking what the status of the class is for next quarter, and I was told it wasn’t being offered. At least the other Chem and BMB majors have labs that will be offered next quarter remotely.

I honestly have no idea what to do now.  I’ve already been accepted to grad school, but if I can’t get that class and graduate, then I’m completely out of luck. COVID has ruined yet another thing.

P.S: BIOC 110L was offered remotely last spring, so there should be no reason theyre not offering it next quarter. Maybe the department just forgot about the people in the Biochem concentration...",0.04318181818181818,0.29924242424242425,ucsc
10808,Off-campus landlord doesn't fix anything...,1,2021-01-21 14:33:16,9,"I really need some advice about my off-campus living situation if anyone could spare the time.

Tldr: landlord takes ages to fix things if at all and I don't know what I can do that's within my legal power. What should I be more stern with demanding? Are they breaking any laws here?

I'm living with a few housemates off-campus this year. Our landlord doesn't bother us which is nice but they also do little to nothing with helping fix things around the house which I believe should be their responsibility. Some examples:

The house was advertised as having a dishwasher and I saw it when I toured the house. But we quickly found out that the dishwasher doesn't work at all. It's been 4 months since we let them know and we still don't have a functioning dishwasher.

Also, our oven cooling fan suddenly stopped working a bit after we moved in. It took them at least 1-2 months to get a replacement part, we had no oven for that entire time.

Just today, the dryer (that was advertised as coming with the house when I toured) stopped working as well. It was already a piece of garbage but at least it dried our clothes (after letting it run 3 cycles). I told the landlord, she hasn't responded yet. Based on the previous experiences I just listed though, I fear she'll take ages to fix it if she even fixes it at all.

I've tried being somewhat pushy but I feel like it might be more helpful if I had a better understanding of my rights as a tenant, etc. Any advice?",0.09861111111111111,0.4461111111111112,ucsc

I know the issues of enrollment, housing and such are a problem at most schools, but aside from those I was wondering if this is a valid rating of the CS program?

I'm a UCSC alumnus circa 2018 and Mechatronics Engineer on contract at Robotics @ Google . We're growing our team of contractors to support a number of research collaborations with various AI research groups at Google, and we're on the lookout for a handful of recent graduates skilled in mechanical, electrical, and software engineering. If you loved Mechatronics at UCSC, you're the kind of engineer we're looking for- although that class is not strictly necessary, it does encompass a number of skills that we need. We've found good folks coming from the CE and RE departments (including myself), but what it says on your degree is less important than the skills you're able to bring to the table, so don't be shy about applying. No prior work experience is necessary, but is desirable.   


The positions we're looking to fill are entry-level contracting positions, specifically as robot operators, but you'll have plenty of opportunities to work on a number of projects. Although they're contractor positions, they're well paid, include benefits, and we get free doordash every work day- and the famous free Google cafes once they reopen post-covid.  


If you're interested in applying just send me a DM, and I'll give you my work email to send your resume to. I know you CE/RE folks are out there, help me show that posting on Reddit about jobs wasn't a terrible idea!

I've done everything else I can do to make my resume ATS friendly, so I figure that bc Robotics isn't a really common major and I wind up checking ""other"" a lot, the system automatically discards my application. 

Should I just be checking EE, CE, and/or CS to try and get my foot in the door; or is that a technicality that will eventually get my application disqualified when I interview with a real person?

I've got average grades and do academic extra curricular stuff, so I figure at least one company out of the 50+ I've applied to would have at least done a follow-up. Has anyone else with an uncommon major experienced anything similar?",0.05833333333333335,0.435,ucsc

I've done decently so far in the pre-reqs, but I've been getting huge anxiety just thinking about the next years.
I've been thinking about switching to applied math since I have a lot of pre reqs done, so I have some questions for those in applied math:


1) What are some of the job prospects of the major? 

2) How is the difficulty and workload of the major in general?

3) How are the opportunities for research, internships, etc?


I'm still debating if I should stick it out in EE, so if there is anyone with a similar experience I would really appreciate some advice. Thanks!",0.05416666666666668,0.5222222222222221,ucsc

I transferred from a community college in Fall 2019 as a computer science student but I haven't had the best experience in my learning ability.

I'm currently taking CSE 101 for the second time and at this point I'm not sure I can complete a computer science degree.  There are 3 main points I ranked that I feel can be my next steps if CS does not work out for me:

1. I am really considering other majors as a plan B.  I might still want to remain in the tech industry so I've been thinking about Cognitive Science, I've been thinking about UX / UI/ product design as an option.  I feel like this could be a best option for me since some of my core CS/Math classes also fulfill some Cog Sci classes but I'm worried if the department will let me change my major this late into my college career.
2. Alternatively if I wanted to continue in CS, maybe UCSC wouldn't be the place to do that.  So I was thinking I would transfer myself to a state school in my hometown in the Bay Area where I wouldn't have to pay for housing (once schools open up again) and maybe the material wouldn't be as rigorous.
3. Or worse case, I obtain an easy degree that's fast to complete and obtain a city job in my area.

Keep in mind I really wanted to finish what I started but I'm just not finding much motivation and patience to complete computer science, especially during the pandemic.  Even if I do graduate, I'm expecting the job search and my actual job to be incredibly stressful as well.  If I'm struggling this early in my career, how can I make it once I work?

If anyone has any advice that could help me in my struggles I would really appreciate it.  I'm sorry for the rant, I'm just not in a good mental state as of currently.",0.13291666666666668,0.44935185185185184,ucsc
