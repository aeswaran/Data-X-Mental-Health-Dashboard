So I need some help. Theres this cute guy in my philosophy class and originally we didnt talk, but one day he started talking to me and we became friends. I started to like him, but I realized he was not interested in me (never really waits for me after class, doesnt really talk unless I start the convo). Since then I havent contributed to class discussions because I dont wanna look dumb in front of him. How do I stop being nervous and giving this guy so much power over me? I dont want my grade to suffer because of this.

Thank you!!"

Are you considering emailing your professor/TF/CA/Course head and telling them that you can't find the link, but are well aware you just can't find the link because you're sleep deprived and too proud to admit when you're wrong?

I've been an advocate of migrating college level (but perhaps not graduate level) work online for a long time. Harvard Extension (my school) is all over it because it enables them to keep tuition low but the College isn't yet fully on board with that idea, because the administration believes something valuable is lost when you take away the in person aspect. I'm on the fence about it - when I attend courses in person, I get something intangible out of it, but others I know think lectures are a total waste of time.  


BUT THAT SAID - what's interesting about this move by Stanford is that the tech infrastructure is solid enough to handle that kind of VOLUME in the first place - can ALL lectures be moved online?  Really??"

I bought Soylent and a chocolate chunk cliff bar. As I am walking from to Sever I hear a guy behind me say ""help a veteran get something to eat."" I turn around and I see a middle aged black gentleman in a wheelchair. 

I pull the Cliff bar out of my pocket and I asked him, ""Hey man I just bought this, do you want it?"" 

He looks at the bar and asks, ""Is it gluten free?"" 

I start looking at the back of the package and say ""I dunno man, I don't think so."" 

He, casually replies, ""Don't worry about it then."" 

I can't stop thinking about this interaction, so much about it was so weird. If I was homeless and asking for food I would definitely say that I had celiac's or gluten sensitivity for turning the food down. He didn't, is no gluten a preference for him? Does he have a gluten allergy? Is he in cahoots with the ""homeless vegetarian"" woman in front of CVS? 

I fully acknowledge that this man is a human being and has the absolute right to turn down my food if he doesn't want it. That being said, it was really disarming to try and give food to this go and be told no. More so, the way he told me no was so condescending. I am struggling to figure out exactly what lessons I should take away from this interaction.

Can you all please help me figure out what I was supposed to learn here? Do you all have any other notable interactions with people in the square?"

Luckily, there are some solutions for this conundrum that will allow you to continue to flex in your virtual classes.

* Headphones

Since people will only be able to see your upper body, headphones are the obvious go-to. Your Bose or Sony's won't cut it anymore, you need something that displays your true status. My recommendation is the [Sennheiser Orpheus.](https://en-us.sennheiser.com/sennheiser-he-1) Coming in at just shy of $60,000 they serve as a good starting point for displaying your wealth and status. The disadvantage is that you won't be able to claim you missed hearing something in class, forcing you to actually pay attention for once, but it's a small price to pay for the amount of drip they come with.

* Your background

The concrete walls of your parent's basement where they're quarantining you until all your filthy Boston germs are gone isn't sufficient. Hopefully you've beat the rush and already reserved the [AirBnB penthouse in Manhattan](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/33279205?location=Manhattan%2C%20New%20York%2C%20NY&amp;adults=1&amp;check_in=2020-04-22&amp;check_out=2020-04-30&amp;source_impression_id=p3_1583846555_GQPQOEZl0kOpVvF4) you're staying at until your summer internship starts. Robot concierge included to prevent infection. Sitting by the window for your classes here reminds everyone that it's worth paying over $1,000 per night for the luxury of not having to be around the sickly. A way to increase your flex is to step away from class halfway through to grab the Peking duck you ordered from Seamless for lunch. Just make sure the driver leaves it at the door so you don't have to see them, let alone talk to them.

* Jewelry

Since your neck will be in view, it's only logical that you show off some ice. This [diamond-studded white gold Cuban chain](https://www.avianneandco.com/collections/diamond-cuban-chain/products/14k-solid-white-gold-mens-diamond-cuban-chain-20-00-ctw) will glisten in the light that comes in through the windows of your penthouse, overexposing your webcam with light so that your classmates will have no choice but to notice it. A bonus is getting a custom Harvard piece commemorating the occasion, which shouldn't take too long to produce if you already have a jeweler on retainer.

There are many other subtle ways to remind your classmates of your superiority during this transition to virtual classes, but I hope this serves as a good starting point for those of you unsure of where to start due to the sudden shift to distance education. **Most importantly,** make sure to remind any Extension students you might come into contact with that your virtual classes are more legitimate and educational than theirs. They should know this already, but a gentle reminder never hurts.

Good luck and good health to you all. I'll see online you from my island in the Maldives that I'll be avoiding the rest of you from. Make sure to wash your hands before you eat those McChickens, and only cough on the Yalies."

fhi4x4,A Pivotal Moment for the Extension School,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/fhi4x4/a_pivotal_moment_for_the_extension_school/,montym,1,2020-03-12 08:33:02,5,/r/Harvard/comments/fhi4x4/a_pivotal_moment_for_the_extension_school/,NaN,"Hello friends,

Harvard's history is marked with numerous occasions when crisis lead to momentous change for the University's constituent schools. The most notable of these events for the purpose of my post is how Radcliffe Women began attending lectures with men only when male attendance dropped during the Second World War. Now is such a moment for the Extension School. 

Once we have contained or survived the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus (and we will survive), all members of the Harvard community should note how much of a resource the Extension School is for the entire university. Not only has it be tacitly (and intently) preparing for widespread distance education for generations, it also provides the University with insight and a diversity of perspectives the University would not have otherwise. 

Furthermore, HES reaches some of the poorest, and most disadvantaged people affiliated with the University. Presidents Faust and Bacow have discussed how Harvard needs to use its ""greatness"" to do more ""good"". Well... HES has been at the forefront of this goal since 1909.

While most people in r/Harvard may demand for the ""In Extension Studies"" tag to be removed from diplomas, I suggest 3 other reforms that will integrate HES more with the broader Harvard community.

1) Open University Apartment Housing up to HES degree students, at least undergrads. Students in Columbia's undergraduate parallel to HES, the School of General Studies (GS), are allowed to enter the housing lottery for their version of University Apartment Housing.

2) Allow HES degree candidates to enroll directly for all FAS classes (prerequisites permitting). Again, Columbia already does this which results in more veterans, mothers, minorities, and professional artists in their classes.

3) Seek donations for (or just build with the \~$40B endowment) a ""House"" for extension programs. This house can rent out rooms to students visiting for on-campus weekends, or to full time students taking all their courses on-campus. It also would give the Extension School a more visible presence on campus, and a new permanent home for a revived Grossman Library. (As an urban planner, I think the Church St. parking lot would be a great place for an ""Extension House"".)

I hope some of you agree with this assessment. Harvard's response to the coronavirus opens a door for HES to ascend to a place within the University it already should hold. I encourage everyone to email the school, the University, and any professor they know to highlight the importance of the Extension School for the entire University. The coronavirus may linger, but it will become old news as quickly as it became a pandemic. Its legacy must be used to improve the University, and one way this can be accomplished is to support the Extension School, and its degree students as much as any other degree candidate."

I was offered an Interview for Harvard, but I became very ill when the time came for the interview. As a result, I was not able to complete an interview as part of my application. Will this reduce my chance of admissions or is the interview not very important?

Hi friends, I'll keep this short and sweet -- I graduated from Harvard in 2019, and have a number of mentees and a sister who are HS '20s. I see that there is a real need for prefrosh to connect virtually with current students / recent alums and each other given that COVID-19 is leading to colleges shutting down their visiting days across the nation. (Unfortunately, VVD is currently only operating in the United States.)

We have students/alums from 60+ colleges on the server at the moment. We hope to expand aggressively throughout the next couple of weeks and will have panels and Q&amp;A sessions throughout April.

You're one of us, but with great power comes great responsibility. I'm not talking academic responsibility, but properly respecting the Harvard name. We're a special breed. People are out to get us, and it's the job of all of us to maintain the prestige behind the name.

You've probably already ordered your Harvard, Champion brand hoodie from the Coop. You made a good choice, it's the best hoodie. But the next time you're at Chipotle and wearing it alongside your friends going to Brown, Cornell, or worse, *Yale,* do you know how to properly address the fact that yes, you do in fact go to Harvard?

Here's a little guide of the time tested responses to the typical situations Harvard students may find themselves in having to discreetly explain that you're better than whomever you may be speaking to.

**Ordering at Starbucks:** If you're getting a hot drink, make sure you ask for one of the red holiday cups. If they ask why, just a simple ""I'm a Harvard student"" will do the trick. They may give you a funny look, but it's jealousy, don't worry about it. Persist until you get your red cup, you wouldn't want to be seen with a green cup and have people think you go to Dartmouth.

**Talking to a parent's friend:** Your parents are going to brag about you. Get used to it, it's the rest of your life. You need to lean to embrace it. Play the offence. Ask them where their children are going to college, such that you have the upper hand in saying ""I'm attending Harvard in the fall."" You don't want to be cornered. You'll receive an array of responses. ""That's very impressive, your parents must be so proud!"" Tell the truth, don't beat around the bush. ""It is, and they are"" is the only proper response. Veritas means truth, after all.

**On a date:** This one is tricky. Being self confident is important. It's good to let them know in the first few minutes, primarily to quickly figure out if they're a Yalie. The easiest option is to buy Harvard socks, and as soon as you meet, go down to tie your shoe. Your pant leg will rise, and their eyes will be drawn to your socks. It's discrete, but a good power move.

**Being asked about college but you're unsure how to mention you go to Harvard:** This one takes work. People can sense the Harvard on you, but they'll often ask for confirmation. The easiest option is to say ""I'm a student at the college."" Don't mention Harvard at first. This is to establish that once they ask ""which college?"" it's implied that they should have assumed Harvard. If they ask what you're studying, philosophy is the best answer. They're expecting finance, but philosophy will help further establish your intellectual dominance over them. Also, remember, it's **concentration**, not major.

**Talking to your friends:** Your friends already know you're superior to them, but a bit of consoling for their admittance to Bowdoin or Wesleyan won't kill you. ""That program there is great"" is a good response to their concerns. Don't mention the discrepancy in endowment size, unless reassuring them that no college really needs more than 2bn anyway (make sure your fingers are crossed behind your back, just to be safe). If you're missing them, make sure you go visit them. You don't want them seeing how much better you have it, and besides, it gives you more opportunities to tell their friends where you go to school.

I'm sure you've all updated your Facebook/Instagram/Tinders already, but make sure to do so now if you're yet to. You're going to have a great two years here before you start your business and drop out, make sure to make the most of them. Remember, don't be downwind of John when you and your friends go to pee on him, and, most importantly, YUCK FALE!

I just want a campus with friendly faces, with a lot of clubs I can become involved in.

Although I did get into Yale and Columbia, they both have aspects that don’t fit what I’m looking for in a school. I still believe Harvard is the perfect balance!

I know getting off a waitlist is extremely rare, but I would hate myself if I don’t try. Basically my question to you guys and gals is: have any of you gotten off a waitlist? If so, what would yo recommend I do. I was deferred REA, so I already sent in a LOCI, should I send another reiterating my interest. I was also interviewed by the regional AO who read my file in late February which really got my hopes up so I have her contact info. Should I send an email thanking her for the continued consideration of my application? 

I know it’s wrong to not be over the moon for schools like Yale or Columbia, but no matter how hard I try I just don’t see myself at them. Any info or insight about the waitlist process would be helpful. The chances are slim but I at least want the closure I gave it my all, and than maybe I’ll start to love that one school in New Haven ;)

Thank you!"

Obviously, because of covid-19, there’s a lot of uncertainty in the air. The lab only told me that they were unsure of how things would be in the Summer and would likely have to contact me again in a month or so.

Are any of you currently in labs that have updated you about the situation? Are your labs closed and planning to stay closed for the Summer? Are any working remotely from your own homes?

I’m not really sure if this is a ridiculous question, but I didn’t want to bother the PI when he has told me he’s not sure. I just wanted to check out how other labs were doing to gauge the future of our lab/my internship. I definitely acknowledge the gravity of the covid-19 situation and don’t mean to sound ungrateful; I’m just trying to understand what might happen. 

Thanks so much."

I am so so lucky to have the privilege to be admitted to Harvard, Columbia, and Barnard College for the class of 2024 and I am in need of some guidance in deciding where I should go for the next four years. I would really appreciate if I can receive some advice from everyone.
I am originally from a country in SEA but I moved to Missouri at the beginning of high school. I am going in undecided but I want to do something in both Stem and Humanities or Social Sciences. 

I am passionate about social justice and would really love to continue activism in college. Thus, I wonder if Harvard is a good place for student activism or is Barnard/Columbia a more supportive environment (after all, there is that jokes about Columbia students changing a lightbulb).
Would you say Columbia with its Core Curriculum is more stressful and competitive than Harvard? 
How exactly does the Harvard curriculum work? Are there room for electives even after your concentration requirements, Gen Ed requirements, divisional distribution, etc? 
Is Shopping Week effective? (I’m under the impression that professors still assign work during Shopping Week. What happens if you decide to take the class at the very end of the week and miss all the previous lessons and assignments?)
How integrated is the campus both racially wise and social economic wise? 
How is the dating culture? (Do you have time for dating?)
If you have any knowledge about the Crimson, is it easy to become a writer for the newspaper if one has no prior experience?
Do you ever feel neglected as an undergrad since Harvard’s grad population is so big? 
Are the big lecture halls a disadvantage or do the smaller discussions make up for the big class size? 
And most importantly, why did you choose Harvard? 

Please help me. I’m so in love with Harvard but I tend to think a lot too so I just need to hear from current students. 
Hopefully I’ll see you all in the fall!"

I have a few questions about the social life at Harvard and would love some input from current students. 

\-  Is is easy to make friends (especially freshman year)? And what is the most common way (clubs, classes, housing)?

\- Can you get the quintessential college experience (meaning are there big parties and drinking)? Are the parties in frats, suites, or other common areas? I am not super into sports, but are there a few big games that are fun to tailgate and go to?

\- Is is easy to get involved on campus in different clubs? 

\- This is a little niche, but if anyone is involved in women's club soccer or the CrimsonEMS: I am interested if they are difficult to get onto and if they are strong communities!

Thank you so much for your help!"

I’m certainly going into CS, and ik that MIT is probably better but I don’t know if I’ll vibe with the overly nerdy culture of MIT. Harvard’s social scene seems to be more of my taste.

Harvard PROs: 

- social atmosphere

- grade inflation/ higher avg gpa(i might want to go onto business school later on + Harvard likely has more connections)

- it’s harvard (world wide prestige — kind of a dream school for me)

Harvard cons: 

- their cs department isn’t on the same level as MIT

- maybe less opportunities for cs internships, since Harvard seems to be leaning more liberal arts

MIT PROS: 

-strong cs dept

- collaborative culture

MIT CONS: 

- too geeky/nerdy 

- difficult (lower avg gpa)

- maybe more competitive for CS internships since like 1/2 the people major in CS

I’ve heard cross registering is a thing, but it is logistically difficult and takes a decent amount of time to commute back and forth. Also, I’m assuming you can only really cross register for a few classes — if I were to do Harvard to MIT

I think the housing system in both places is fine for me. 

Do CS companies prefer MIT grads over Harvard’s? Do they compensate more for one over the other?"

Since I'll be new to the area, I guess I just wanted a few pointers on what its like and what I should do or avoid. edit: I'm living in the GSAS dorms (probably) my first year.

I am aware that winters exist (I have a wind breaker and a big puffy ski jacket/parka), but does anyone have any other recommendations for weather wear?

\-I'm not all that fit anymore, but enjoy the occasional jog/walk/run around a campus. Are there other activities that I could possibly be introduced to during my time here?

\-I'm a sucker for good bakeries, cafes, and boba places. Are there any nearby?

Personally, I've wanted to maintain some type of connection, but life as an adult gets busy and complicated, and I often find that it gets bumped lower on the list of life's priorities.  I did alumni interviewing for some years, and found it rewarding to help out and to represent Harvard to applicants.  When I was back in the area, I reached out to a few student groups and did a few talks about the premed process.  I went to a few groups' meetings, but didn't keep that up.  I've been somewhat wary of official alumni association things, as my family's experiences with respect to spam, etc. has not been good.

I've thought about reaching out again to undergrads to pay forward some experience and see how I can help--even perhaps inconsequential stuff like bringing some people on a a Costco run for their suitemates--or informal advising, but am not sure how much anyone would want that kind of assistance or interaction.  Unfortunately, life still limits how much time I'd have to dedicate, and I'd want to make sure I'm in a position to fulfill a larger commitment should I volunteer for one."

I originally posted this in r/ApplyingToCollege but was told to post here too. Basically, I'm in the incredibly lucky position of being able to choose between Harvard and Stanford. However, I am having trouble deciding, especially as the deadline is this week!

Some info on me: I'm from the Bay Area. While currently undecided, I'm thinking about majoring in some mix of CS + Econ, although I have a wide set of interests so I would like to be able to explore many fields. I have visited both schools, but know comparatively less about Harvard since we visited while my older brother was applying to colleges so I was much younger. I would love to end up in NYC in the future, although of course that's subject to change!

**Harvard**

Pros

* urban environment, integrated within city
* Cambridge/Boston/East Coast would be a great new experience (snow!)
* insane alumni network, connections to NYC/Wall Street
* liberal arts education
* can also take classes at MIT

Cons

* not as strong at CS
* club comping seems somewhat intimidating and elitist
* not sure how true this is but Harvard has a reputation for being more uptight and snobbish
* I feel like I know less about Harvard, since all the in-person admitted events have been cancelled due to COVID-19, so I'm unsure of how I'll actually feel about the campus/vibe/etc.

**Stanford**

Pros

* again, I don't know how true this really is but Stanford students have a reputation for being happier
* supposedly a friendlier, kinder, more collaborative environment
* insanely good at CS
* can easily join any club, no club comping
* nice weather

Cons

* feels a little too close to/similar to home
* Stanford bubble, suburban environment
* pressure to do CS feels somewhat limiting

g9btbo,Sob story for financial aid?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/g9btbo/sob_story_for_financial_aid/,Goodman9473,0,2020-04-27 16:18:38,0,/r/Harvard/comments/g9btbo/sob_story_for_financial_aid/,NaN,"So I actually go to Princeton, but because our sub is dead and this sub seems to be pretty alive I figured I’d ask here. 

My grandfather was a financial aid consultant for several decades, so naturally he does my financial aid forms. Long story short, this past semester I completely slacked off and barely spent any time studying. Unsurprisingly this is reflected in my grades. The courses weren’t particularly hard—I just completely neglected my coursework and focused on other things. 

My grandfather basically wrote a whole sob story for my financial aid statement how I “I fear that I did not fulfill the promise that Princeton saw in me” and “I promise I will do better,” etc. He goes on to write how my bad grades are associated with financial struggles at home, etc. 

I think it is way overboard. I don’t think the FA is even aware of my grades, nor do I think they particularly care given that FA is purely need based. I feel like they’re gonna be “you feel we’re disappointed you didn’t fulfill the promise we ‘saw’ in you??” Who tf even are you?? 


What are you’re thoughts? Thanks!"

The full tuition promises a full-campus experience. 

If students will sit days And night at home, in a chair staring at a screen and stressing to meet deadlines of study and homework, then we should just pay only for the online lecture and professor grading. 

No library, no labs, no facilities, no campus feel, = no full tuition.

I was rank 9, I did all the APs and shit, and sacrificed my chance at valedictorian so I could play jazz guitar in my school.

And I didn’t do any of that just to build a resume. I did it because it was what I was personally passionate about. No parents forcing me or anything, no familial pressure, Just me and my own aspirations, working my ass off regardless.

Don’t get me wrong, I love my life now. I really enjoy the school I’m at and couldn’t be happier... but after talking with the class below me that are graduating high school right now, and hearing similar, dire results from our school, I’m wondering how you guys were able to cut above the rest of us and get accepted.

Have you ever gone through course selection and really wanted to know what the workload for a class was like, but didn't know anyone who took the class before and there are no reviews on VAgrades or RateMyProfessor? The only way you could learn about the class is to email the professor for a syllabus and hope they respond... yeah right good luck with that. But now no longer... with [SyllabiShare](https://syllabi-share.herokuapp.com/). (sorry for the infomercial monologue I always wanted to do one)

Over the past 4 days or so I have been developing an app that allows students to post syllabi for other people at their university to see and download. Now that I have secured a fair amount of AWS funding,   and a successful closed alpha/beta with students I know from universities across America, I will be holding an open beta for university students who see this post on Reddit/Facebook. The core functionality, uploading, searching for, viewing, and downloading syllabi, of the app is sound, but there are some UI things and extra features that need tweaking, which is what I need your help for. I ask that you login with your university email, upload a syllabus or two that are not already there, take a look at other syllabi, and leave some suggestions on the feedback tab on the site, in the comments of this post, or in a DM to me.

I also ask that you do not abuse this platform for anything it is not intended to do. I will be monitoring the site periodically to check for abusive content and take it down. I remind you that I will have computing ids and IPs of everyone posting.

Finally, if anyone would like to join a small team to help with this project please feel free to PM me. The code is public on Github for anyone to see and fork. This project is not for profit, any money that is made will be used to run this app, it ain't cheap and I am paying for AWS out of pocket once my free credit runs out. Please feel free take a swing at the app and try something new and let me know if there is something you want to see!

Sorry if I'm breaking the sub rules, but I thought this would best place to ask since Harvard is very unique in how transfers are handled. 

At the moment, I am an incoming frosh at Yale, so I understand how this post may come out as short sighted. I am very fortunate to have this opportunity and I will definitely be going to Y with an open mind. This year, I was waitlisted from H and ultimately rejected off the WL. This is very premature, but I thought I would ask in case I do decide to attempt a transfer. I don't have an obsession with H, but I know I would regret it if I didn't at least think to or try to transfer.  That being said, it is very likely I end up loving Yale and decide to stay. 

My main question is if going to a very similar school like Yale would put me at a disadvantage. Basically, would I stand any chance without some drastic circumstance drawing me away from Yale. I was also wondering how accommodating Harvard is for veteran transfer. I'm planning on doing ROTC, but enlisting in the military that traditional way is something I was considering for a long time. Before application this year, I was seriously thinking about enlisting with a 2-3 year contract. My main goal is to serve, and going the enlisted route would allow me to cut the serve commitment by 3 years. Say I did a year at Yale, and then 2-3 in the military, how would that play out in a transfer situation. My last questions is what kind of disadvantage or advantage does being waitlisted for freshman admissions have if I decided to attempt to transfer. 

If anybody knows or knows of a successful transfer applicant, I would love to hear your input! Thanks for reading this pretty long post!!"

I understand that maybe some of these parents don’t have another outlet to share the good news (especially due to COVID), but I find most of it to be very off putting. My mom mostly shares news with my grandparents or occasionally her friends, not other Harvard parents. Perhaps that is exactly the point of these Harvard parents groups and I am just not into that sort of stuff. I guess they are proud of their kids and want to share it with some like-minded parents?

Using a throwaway account because I'm usually more of a lurker on reddit than a poster. 

Now that 6 grad schools are officially going online for the Fall international students have been advised to not move to the US until in-person classes restart. I (naively) had an idea in my head of moving to the Boston area if classes went online in order to be in the same timezone/ have access to resources/ have some resemblance of a social life/ familiarise myself with where I had anticipated my professional and academic life would be for the next two years... 

I'm now trying to decide between deferring for a year when it's unlikely that I'll get a new job (for context my contract ran out and wasn't renewed because of covid) or starting online and hoping that I'll be able to move for the Spring semester (which obviously can't be guaranteed to be in person). 

I do think that having class online is the best way to ensure that everyone is as safe as possible, but the situation with embassies etc has created a unique problem for international students, so I would love to hear what other international students are thinking of doing and why."

I want to preface this by saying that I'm a CS concentrator and I hate political courses. I've taken some history courses where the prof just wanted to tell us how he felt about contemporary politics and I wanted to shoot myself. 

175D is amazing first and foremost because Prof. John Stauffer is a legend. He runs the course as a discussion but still brings his input in an interesting way. He is such an eloquent, erudite man that it's insane his course is as small as it is. 

The course covers rhetoric and speeches around the Civil War. The topics are hard hitting. You'll be discussing things that are in active debate today. Racism, slavery, the role of protest, freedom and government. However, and this is amazing to me, the class never got political for me. 

I couldn't tell you what Prof. Stauffer's political beliefs are (though I could make some guesses) and while we were discussing very emotional issues, taking it through the lens of rhetoric and Lincoln/Douglass allowed the class to express themselves in what I thought was a very genuine way.

Further, it's easy. You do have reading for each class and some papers throughout the semester. However, it's one of those courses that you'll be engaged in enough to not feel like you're forcing yourself to sit down and work on it."

&amp;#x200B;

5. Econ 50:

Great intro class that requires basically no knowledge of econ, or math, or coding, or much of anything useful, and since you are a humanities kid thats probably right up your alley. 

4. Math 21b 

Linear algebra, really? It doesn't get much easier than this. y = mx +b, come on, that's baby shit. This is just like learning what lines are, the only tricky part is now they call them vectors––big whoop. 

3. Applied Math 22a

coming in at just 8 hours of work per week according to the Q guide this is like linear algebra but, like, applied, sounds easy to me. The prof uses the word ""gentle"" in the course description, it doesn't get much easier than that. 

2. Math 23a

So this one is like the baby linear algebra mentioned earlier but now there is some ""real analysis"" tacked on. Oh boy, I go day to day looking at real things, now you want me to analyze them? Cake walk!

1.Math 55a 

""Studies in algebra and group theory""?  Your biggest challenge in this course will be trying to remember the basic algebra you learned in like 6th grade. The group theory portion? The perfect prep for blocking groups. 

Some people claim this is the hardest math class in the country, but thats mostly hype so people dont figure out how easy this class is. I hear 100% of the 10% of kids who don't drop the class, get A's, so you are basically 100% guaranteed to get an A! You're welcome!"

I graduated summa cum laude in 2019 from the University of Maryland, College Park with a degree in Government and Politics. I did my first two years at community college in Maryland to save on costs. 

Since October, I’ve been the Legislative Director to the second-highest ranking member of the Maryland House of Delegates where I plan to work until the end of 2022. 

I’m fortunate to work on a variety of higher-level state policy in my current job and see this as an opportunity to hone in on the specific policy area I’d like to specialize in while doing work I feel is having an impact. I know that I want to continue a career in public policy and feel that the Kennedy School could provide me access to the best network of professors and peers as I continue my education.

While earning by BA, I took a variety of statistics and Econ courses but never took calculus. I am planning on taking calculus and some additional Econ classes in the coming years at a local community college as I prepare to apply for admission to the Kennedy School. 

Does anyone have other bits of advice as to what I could do in the meantime to help my chances of admission? 

Thanks!"

I am in my 2nd year of my BA Politics at a top British university and I was just wondering if anyone has any experience/advice regarding the PhD programmes at the Department for Government or HKS? 

I am quite critically minded and I worry that the course will be taught mainly along establishment lines, Washington Consensus/free-market economics, rational choice theory, blah blah blah. How has your experience been? What is the curriculum like? The department site only gives minimal details.

My main interest is I suppose Foucauldian, looking at how neoliberalism has played a role in the crisis in mental health in young people amongst other things.

I'm also just very passionate about political theory, critical political economy, cultural theory, psychoanalysis and so on.

Also if there are any fellow Brits who could chime in on this that would be much appreciated!

Thanks!"

I have personally contacted Comcast over 20 times about this issue and they refuse to fix it.

**I think we should do something about this.** Even if you are not having internet issues, you are probably suffering from the Comcast monopoly in Cambridge. We need more internet options in our city, but the Cambridge City Manager and the Cambridge City Council refuse to address this problem.

If this is something you care about, here are some things you can do:

1. Read and sign this petition for municipal broadband: [https://upgradecambridge.org/](https://upgradecambridge.org/)
2. Contact the Cambridge City Council and let them know you will be voting on this issue ([council@cambridgema.gov](mailto:council@cambridgema.gov))
3. Spread the word (Twitter, Slack, email lists). If someone could post this on large university email lists (such as the CSAIL list), I know there would be a lot of interest.
4. Vote. The government won't do anything unless we make it a priority for them. The City Manager, Louis DePasquale, has actually blocked this issue from moving forward. He needs to listen to Cambridge residents or be replaced with someone who cares.
5. Ask for alternatives: [netblazr.com/](https://www.netblazr.com/), [verizon.com/home/fios-fastest-internet/](https://www.verizon.com/home/fios-fastest-internet/) (\*some people do not like Verizon; see link below), [rcn.com/boston/](https://www.rcn.com/boston/), [starry.com](https://starry.com/)

Nothing is going to change unless we do something about it. **These steps only take a few minutes and could greatly improve our city.**

Last August, in a lawsuit brought by fraternities and sororities to challenge the policy, Judge Gorton of the United States District Court in Boston denied Harvard’s motion to dismiss the case. In essence, the court accepted the plaintiffs’ legal theory that the policy, although adopted to counteract discrimination based on sex, is itself an instance of discrimination based on sex. The court reasoned that the policy applies to men but not women who seek to join all-male social organizations and applies to women but not men who seek to join all-female social organizations, and that this constitutes sex discrimination under federal law. In reaching this view, Judge Gorton relied heavily on the reasoning in one of the appellate decisions (Zarda v. Altitude Express) that was affirmed by the Supreme Court. It now seems clear that Judge Gorton would ultimately grant judgment in the plaintiffs’ favor in the pending lawsuit and that Harvard would be legally barred from further enforcing the policy. 

In view of the Supreme Court’s decision, following Judge Gorton’s prior opinion in the lawsuit against Harvard, the Corporation consulted with the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Dean of Harvard College, and the University’s General Counsel last week. We together came to the view that, in the circumstances, the College will not be able to carry forward with the existing policy under the prevailing interpretation of federal law. As a result, following a vote of the Corporation on Friday to rescind its prior approval, the policy will no longer be enforced."

If you're like me you should have gotten an email from [harvard@electionservicescorp.com](mailto:harvard@electionservicescorp.com) today with your Your Election Validation Number to vote in the Harvard University's Board of Overseers and for Elected Directors of the Harvard Alumni Association (HAA). This is the highest democratically elected Alumni board at Harvard and they have been filled with HAA selected alumni for a long long long time. So a group called Harvard Forward is working to democratically elect 5 candidates to the Board of Overseers to move Harvard forward (get it?) on divesting from fossil fuels, committing more resources to climate-focused initiatives, including recent alumni into our governance, and giving a greater voice to students. 

One of the candidates (John Beatty) is a friend from my time at Harvard's Environmental Action Committee so I can attest that this group is filled with super-stars. 

**Harvard Forward Five for Overseers**: Margaret ""Midge"" Purce, Jayson Toweh, Lisa Bi Huang, John Beatty, Thea Sebastian 

**Endorsed HAA Directors (choose 6 of 7):** 

Kelsey Trey Leonard, Joyce Y. Zhang, Mallika J. Marshall, Vanessa Zoltan ​​​​​​, Santiago Creuheras, Benjamin D. Wei, Michael D. Lewis

Instructions to vote: [https://www.harvardforward.org/vote](https://www.harvardforward.org/vote) 

A little about Harvard Forward: 

 **We recognize that there are many things happening in the world right now that need your attention.** The coronavirus pandemic is ongoing, and the Black Lives Matter movement still needs our unfailing support and attention. Many Harvard affiliates have stepped up in the fight to create a more just society and to support those who are suffering. Now it is time for Harvard, as an institution, to follow in their footsteps and take up the mantle of moral leadership and decisive action.   


The Harvard Forward candidates aren't just running on a platform of climate action, responsible investing, and inclusive governance. **They're running to send a message that alumni demand better than the status quo**; that alumni are looking to Harvard to take a stance on the critical issues that are directly threatening the wellbeing and existence of current and future generations.  


**This means addressing not just climate change but also systemic racism**, and Harvard Forward is committed to making anti-racism a larger part of our platform. We're currently reaching out to those in the Harvard community who are leading anti-racism organizing to find out how we can best support their efforts, and we'll share our progress with you as it develops.   


**We know that a majority of** **Harvard** **alumni believe that** **Harvard** **can and must do better.** We simply need to get the word to them that this year's Board election is the opportunity to create a mandate for change.  

If we get these guys on the board - **this would make history** by having candidates elected and represented by the people, not by being nominated by HAA. Last year less than 12% of alumni voted - if you see this and vote and then share it, it makes a real difference. Our community is small and I'm sure you know friends that would be interested as well - please forward."

They only planned on staying for 1-2 years here in Boston. before returning to Mexico after saving some money and working. In 2001 I was born and they realized they couldn't return because there's no future for me in the indigenous little village they came from. They did not come here legally and only one of them would work for the next couple of years, my dad who earns 2 dollars above minimum wage to support a family of five now. My brother was born two years later and my sister five years after my brother. I didn't learn English until the summer before I started kindergarten, I didn't go to pre-school. My dad couldn't support all of us being the only one working so around age 11, the summer after my fifth grade graduation he started bringing me to work under the table to help make some extra cash without it getting in the way of my education. 

I wasn't always the smartest kid in the room but I was little above average and I had a pretty good work ethic. I would continue to work with him on Saturdays and summers. So did my brother when was a little bit older. When I got to my freshmen year of high school I was so excited to be able to do all this stuff and my father felt it was time to stop taking me to work now so I could focus on school and extra curricular. I was so excited I tried doing everything, I took all honors, band, track, and tennis. I even did latin club and a couple others. I overloaded myself with work and burned out, I gave up on school. I didn't give up because it became to much, I gave up because I finally realized I wouldn't be able to afford college and high school was pointless for me. I tried dropping out but my parents wouldn't let me. Freshmen year hit my grades hard and brought my gpa to a 2.5. 

When it came to sophomore year I heard about a transfer program low income people do where they study at north shore community college for two years and then transfer to a state college for the same tuition. I was excited that I could continue my education, and I eased up on the extra curricular. Instead I devoted my time to band and my love for music. I reconnected with my old church bully, who was two years older than me, and we became best friends. I saw so much of what I wanted to be in her. She had a job, was top of her class. I owe the effort I put into school a lot to her because she became a huge role model for me. When I turned 16 I got a real job at chipotle, but this was worst than working with my dad. When I worked with my dad it would be 14 hour shifts but he knew I was just a kid and tell me to take breaks a lot when he saw me tiring myself out, even let me nap in the restaurant office. I don't know how many people know this but chipotle was recently given the biggest child labor fine in state history, and I can see why. I would work from 4-11 sometimes 12 on school nights, the weekends would vary from 4 hour shifts to sometime 10 or 12 hour shifts. I didn't know what child labor laws were but I continued working them because my family needed the money. I didn't want to see my little brother and sister to see a Christmas with no presents under the tree again. It was horrible seeing their sad disappointed faces the year before and I promised to never let them be that sad on Christmas ever again. I told the upper class-men my plan and they were against it. They told me the credits don't always transfer and I might have to retake a lot of the courses in the state school anyway. I started falling back into that depression again.

Junior year comes around and I decide to join the airfare to help pay for school, I talk to a recruiter tell him I want to major in computer science at the Air Force's college and work as a cyber security specialist. He tells me I can't because my parent's are undocumented so I won't get the security clearance required. I talk to the marines, they don't have anything I want and try to push me for infantry. I finally get to the army active duty and reserves. I think about it then I go to get my permit, and I see the national guard poster. I immediately remember I have an MP cousin at Lowell. I talk to him about it and he said I shouldn't unless I'm out of options. Well guess what, I couldn't recover my grades from the working. I had low test scores due to a lack of resources and everyone saw me as an average kid who just cracks jokes, nothing else. Who was going to write my recommendation letters unless I proved myself. I tried become a cyber security specialist again, no luck because of my parents. I tried going for MP, something happened. Finally I land the job I have now, truck driver. Since it was my junior year he told me I could do boot camp that summer and job training after senior year, so I did. I was about 210lbs so I spent that whole school year trying to lose weight since I was very over weight in order to meet army standards. On top of that I was still working at chipotle. I finally lost enough weight through extreme dieting and was in. 

The BCT was the hardest thing I had ever done in life. I trained at Fort sill and had never left my family for more than a day. It took a psychological toll on me. In the end it did make me stronger and less reliant on my family. I made some good money and sent a lot of it over to my sick grandmother in Mexico for medicine, or to my dad to help with rent so my brother didn't have to work. 

I returned to my senior year happy, average grades but happy. I found a way to pay for school, I had people's respect for doing BCT I was the only kid in my school that year to do it. I was in shape, girls actually thought I was cute. It was time to apply for colleges. I wasn't able to take AP classes this year because I wasn't home to do the summer work. I didn't really stick out to schools. One of my best friends pushed me to apply for more competitive schools and not to settle for less. He told me I was hard working and should show the schools, he pushed to apply for Harvard and I honestly wasn't that interested in the school until I visited. I mean who doesn't want to go to school where all the students share ideas like yours and push themselves to be the best. ""I could major in something simple and get a decent paying job, but then I'll be known as that guy who's pretty good at math when I could study something and somewhere where they'll help me impact the world."" After my friend said that I was hooked, Harvard was where I wanted to go. After I cam back from the BCT I got a job at a fine dining restaurant but now I was 18. They would hold me until 11pm in the seaport district and I would have to take a train then a bus to get home. I wouldn't arrive until 12am on school night's. ""I'm a soldier now, I can do it now"" is what I would tell myself every-night on the walk to the train when I thought about giving up open school. I started recording my self for a week to show Harvard who I am and why my grades were so low. Before I could finish editing the video and send it in, COVID hit and I had to pick up hours because my dad's restaurant was one of the first to close. My family came first and I never sent in the video. I would receive a rejection later a few weeks later. 

I wasn't surprised, I had average grades, average test scores, a common ""my parents are immigrants"" essay. I'm now going to attend Umass Lowell in the fall, maybe spring depending on how long my training takes. I still want to apply to transfer to Harvard, one more time. I don't just want to major in computer science anymore. All these civil rights movements have recently made me realize that someone needs to step up and speak for family's like mine. We have no say in elections, yet we pay taxes and show love to this country and our communities. I truly do want to be somebody and change the way people look at us. I know Harvard can help me get there, they've shown time and time again that they create leaders. I want to be a leader. 

I need help on the transfer process and don't know when I can start trying to transfer. I don't know if I should try going in as a student transfer or military transfer. Please help me, anyone."

But, I took pretty much 0 ""real"" math (as opposed to theoretical CS) with my undergrad, so I'm missing some major undergrad-level prereqs to even apply for a masters.

Does anyone know if, say, NYU or Columbia masters programs would accept Harvard Extension grades in order to fill those prereqs? Would it matter if I take the HES classes as a non-degree, undergrad, or master's candidate? I see the price tags are quite different but I can't tell from the website if the content is any different, or just the final degree. The non-degree price is comparable to my local public schools and a lot more convenient than having to Zoom in to a lecture every day while I'm at work."

The whole country seems to have stopped caring, even though we still know hardly anything about covid. I was listening to a nyt podcast today that said covid isn’t even a respiratory illness, it’s a vascular illness that attacks your blood vessels and causes millions of blood clots in your body. The cough is just a side affect of this, by the time your coughing it’s already done damage to your kidneys, brain, literally every organ. It mutates every two weeks, with a mutation in Italy resulting in it being up to 10x more contagious then the Wuhan strain. 

It’s going to be an absolute shit show at college campuses in the fall. Headlines like “Every student at Cornell forced to quarantine, 20 dead, over 60% of students positive”. Harvard starting small with a pilot program they are likely to be able to manage is the smart thing to do. And bringing back freshmen first is also the smart thing to do. 

You can be upset at the decision and recognize that it was the right one. I think in hindsight we will recognize that this was the right decision"

Why You are NOT going to campus? 

On GroupMe chats everybody is getting influenced into going to campus for 10 weeks!! 
I’d like personal viewpoints please! (Incognito😅)

That would be sad. ☹️

Please be honest and share your true thoughts and fears. 

I wonder about the risks involved for family too to help us settle in at dorms. 
Just a few points I’m thinking about: 👇

Flights. Airports. Transit. Hotels for family to stay in. Eat outside meals when family drops you at campus. Once at dorms -  Dining. Laundry. Bathrooms hygiene. Limited mobility on campus. Frequent testing. Incessant anxiety and worry about health safety and studying. 

Please share your thoughts. 😇Thanks so much!!"

I did not believe it at first because my friend thought it was one of those dubious emails. 

Apparently licenses are given out. My friend studied business/management (with a concentration in finance) but wanted to go into acting / film-making (and thought of one day using photoshop, premier pro, illustrator etc.). He does not know how to use *any* of the tools from the Adobe suite (except maybe adobe reader for reading adobe pdf files). My friend is really grateful for the gift but also a little afraid because artists don't generally fare well (except maybe Terrence Malick &amp; Darren Aronofsky &amp; Matt Damon etc.) 

Did any other grads/students get a free license  to software ? If so, what are you folks going to do with it?"

I’ll be 21 by that time so I know I won’t be required to live on campus so I wonder if it would make a huge difference socially if I don’t. (Given that it would be post Covid-19) I would love to be as social as possible and make as many friends and experiences as I can but I also would really love my own space that I can call truly “home” in a way. I would be able to afford living off campus but I’m wondering if there are a lot of undergraduates that do so or if it takes away from the experience. Thanks a lot!!!!

Seeing other subs that deal with similar problems, I have two proposals:

1. Get Automoderator to comment on posts with keywords such as ""admissions"", ""alumni"", ""waitlist"" ""transfer"". The comment can remind them the first rule. This way, they are likely to read the rule and remove the post if appropriate;                              or,
2. Instead of publishing, require posts including these keywords  to go through moderator approval. As things stand now, mods have to go through them anyway because they get reported. 

Please comment if you have another idea or have similar moderation experience. I'd love to hear what our mods say, too."

I applied early action, never expected to get in, but when I did, I then immediately accepted my offer - because it's Harvard. I didn't really care about college environment or campus life because I believed most of it was pretty bs. I was going to be in a city and in the best college in the world. I could make my own life great at Harvard. I would make a ton of friends, go out, have fun, typical college life.

Fast forward two years later and I can't help but laugh at myself. These past two years at Harvard have been so awful. 3.7 GPA which is ok but not great enough right now, terrible dorm situation freshman year where there was literally no community b/c I lived in Wigg and my suitemates and I just did not vibe, failed a comp (twice) that consumed my life and as a result ruined my grades and opportunities to socialize or meet people or join more inclusive clubs freshman year, a toxic blocking group that just fell apart, and one big hunk of depression and an ocean of suicide thoughts. 

I see everyone I know at Yale loving college and wanting to go back to school. On the other hand, all of my friends at Harvard say the same thing ""I should have gone to Yale. They're happy."" ""I hate Harvard."" We all chose Harvard because of the clout, and in the end got handed literally no dorm or ""house"" community, an incredibly exclusive and toxic social culture, and ridiculous semester-long comp processes just to join a fucking club. It's like Harvard has to put barriers for everything and make everything so hard to get. Seeing other students at Yale, Princeton, Stanford be way happier and be at just as good of a school is really disappointing. A big part of me regrets choosing Harvard and wish I had applied to other schools and really researched their campus life instead of just jumping the gun as soon as I got into Harvard early action. Maybe I'm desperate to not be completely miserable, but can someone give me a reason as to why Harvard is the right choice over these other schools? About what makes Harvard actually better despite the fact that my life here was so miserable?"

I am updating the automoderator in response to some suggestions regarding Rule 1 violations. Thank you for the input! We should hopefully be seeing fewer blatant rule 1 violations from now on.


---

While I'm at it, I wanted to address a new rule for posting in the subreddit. I have had a few users mention to me that we should experiment with a new rule regarding Harvard Extension School posts. A significant percentage of posts about HES tend to be ""ontological""; they are about name HES name recognition, comparative prestige, ""is it real Harvard"", admissions rigor, etc. This is a very tired topic and over-debated (I'm sure you can all agree). I want to be clear that the moderators of this subreddit do not endorse any particular view on these posts, but do seek to curate discussion that is productive instead of adversarial and over-done. To that end:

**The (tentative) new rule (call it Rule 1a) is any HES post must not be ontological as described above**. To be very clear about what this means, here are some examples of HES posts that would and would not be removed under rule 1a.

Removed | Not Removed
---|---
[Exhibit A](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/bjbaqy/about_to_be_a_graduate_from_hes_with_extension/) | [Exhibit 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/admddj/hes_what_time_are_grades_posted/) 
[Exhibit B](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/5ji6qb/can_i_tell_my_friends_i_go_to_harvard_if_its_hes/) | [Exhibit 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/aixskc/hes_alb_acronym_history/)
[Exhibit C](https://reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/4i9dj4/harvard_extension_schoolbad_rep/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi60_eju97qAhVJ5awKHUwKA1MQFjACegQIBxAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw1jG4m3obD13F7ucQU3j9FV) | [Exhibit 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/92d6t7/my_harvard_email_not_deleted_after_my_class_at/)

I hope the distinction is clear from these examples. If not, feel free to comment below and I'll try to explain further. 

---

The types of posts for Rule 1a. are difficult to configure into the automoderator because of the nuanced and complicated nature of how they can be worded. Key words are not good enough. **So, in full transparency, I have added an automoderator rule that requires any HES post (literally containing those key words) to be approved by a moderator before they make it to the subreddit.** This is definitely not ideal, and I don't mean it to be an affront to HES posts, but it's the only way I could figure out to enforce this rule. Rest assured that I will approve your HES posts nearly as soon as they are submitted, as I enabled push notifications for moderator approvals on my phone. We of course want to keep this subreddit open for HES student discussion, news, memes, events, etc. 

As with all other rules, if a moderator decides that the post violates Rule 1a, then a flair will be added to the post indicating as such and it will be removed.

Edit: changed exhibit C to a better example."

Hello people of Harvard Reddit, I have a question regarding these two schools and would like to give a preface for my situation and see what are these two programs.

I'm not really thinking of applying to these schools, more so I am just looking for information that is vague and the program is so new.

Obviously the first thing you do when you decide what master's program is your target is google what schools actually offer the masters. Scrolling down a bit past the ads and the 6th university website listed for Biotech masters was Harvard Extension. I'm here because I clicked on it to see what's up since I clicked the other 5 universities before it.

The whole process of earning admission with classes is pretty strange to me, but it seems interesting. Except I only heard of Harvard Extension prior for being a school of Ivy Rejects (it's quite a foul name), so is this program even worth the time, effort, and money for a Harvard University degree: Master of Liberal Arts (ALM) in Extension Studies, field: Biotechnology. (Copy pasted from the website.)

Seemed strange so I did look into the school a little more out of curiosity to see if they offer another ms in biotech (curiosity because of the strangeness), short answer yes but you have to take it with the MBA. Why? I mean sure I probably wouldn't get in with my GPA but if someone who really just wants the MS from Harvard in Biotech, why is it combined?  I looked a little further and even if you get denied by the dual program you can still get into the MBA program only, but not the MS program only? This approach for the degrees in biotech from Harvard's graduate programs seems strange so I was hoping for some clarification since I can't find much on MS/MBA program (it started in 2019 and has 1 page of info...).

Thanks to anyone who replies. I've never really seen programs like these so I'm hoping for some insight on why it's like this."

Someone I know is a private investigator. He is investigating a case. Turns out that a professor at Harvard Business School by the name of Lee Fleming was persistently bullying a student. So, my question is: how common is this? It was also noted that while this bullying was happening, nothing was done. Is that also a common response in America?

Commentators who are Catholics have noted how this sort of behavior is a grave sin. Here is a sample response.

\&gt; Intentionally harming another to no apparent benefit/protection of some third person,   
\&gt; is pretty obviously sinful no matter who you are.  


Given that this whole thing rises to the level of shocking and egregious, what sort of Christianity is the Church at Harvard really practicing? Is it some sort of New Age Christianity where Christ has been replaced with ""Calvin and Hobbes""?"

Are any of you here  currently in the engineering program or can attest to its strengths/weaknesses.

I'm also very interested in Cornell, which seems to have a stronger engineering program.

Obviously, both schools are fantastic, and I'd be thrilled if I got to attend one or the other.

So to explain my family's housing situation - my family owns a house which they rent out, and we live in a rented apartment ourselves (the difference in the two rent amounts acts as a source of income). However, the family that used to live in the house we're renting out is planning to move out in a month or so, and so we're planning to move back in. For the last few years, this house has counted as an investment property, because of which its net worth was taken into account as an asset and my financial aid packages have always been much lower than if just income were taken into account. 

Now my question is- since this house will no longer count as rented real estate, will its value still be considered while deciding aid? Is it worth requesting a reconsideration with the hope that I get a more affordable fin aid package?"

Personally, I'm really going to miss events such as *Crimson Jam*, the student-only night at the Harvard Art Museum, various clubs, random events that pop up each semester on bulletin boards around campus and even picking up a copy of The Crimson (should I see one).

I'll definitely miss being able to study in Widener. That place has been a haven for my ability to focus - I'm so much more capable of working in there since it's so quiet and I have less distractions than home. That and it's a a gorgeous building. 

I also have little spots on campus I like to just sit at and read/study. The nook in the top of Sever's Film Library was amazing for that, as was parts of the Science Center.

But I will ***not*** miss dodging selfie sticks and having to find a way around tourists trying to figure out if they can go into X building or not."

I'm planning on concentrating in Social Studies and was planning to take PSY 1900 to fulfill my stats requirement because it seems to be the best-liked of all intro stats courses. On the Q guide, a bunch of pre-meds and social studies students seem to have taken it. 

But now it looks like you have to have a Psychology background to take it now. From my.harvard:

Recommended Prep:

The Psychology Department requires completion of Science of Living Systems 20 or Psychology 1 or the equivalent of introductory psychology (e.g. Psych AP=5 or IB=7) before enrolling in this course.

###### Course Requirements:

Pre-requisite: SLS20 or PSY1 or Psychology AP=5 or Psychology IB=7 or Psyc S-1

&amp;#x200B;

I've heard course requirements are more suggestions than anything else, but I've never taken a class without meeting the prereqs before and the wording here seems super scary. Will I be able to take Psy 1900 despite having never studied psychology in my life? I just want the R goshdarnit."

I've been surprised at how small Harvard's CS department looks (at least for graduate students) compared to other well-known schools (for instance it doesn't look like there's extensive research into formal methods by any faculty here). Can any of you attest to this?

For context, here are the other schools I'm looking at (and a fair warning, this list is way too long and part of the reason I'm looking for feedback is to help trim down this list): KTH, ETH Zurich, EPFL, Stanford, University of Michigan, CMU, Princeton, Cornell, Penn, Yale, University of British Columbia, Oxford University, Cambridge University, Harvard University, McGill University, Kings College London."

That sucks for those students who were denied “based on race” and im sorry. Im sure a bunch of kids that got denied are upset by that—I  would be too. 

What I don’t understand is that whenever we look at admissions stats at Harvard or Yale, or any other elite university where race is taken into consideration in admissions no one asks why there aren’t more Black students!? 

If affirmative action policies are so aggressively pushing Black students into the Ivy league, why the fuck are there not more of us here? 

I am so tired of hearing how unfair these admissions policies are for White and Asian students without hearing an acknowledgment that Black students make up only 6% of the students at “elite” educational institutions
(this figure per the Atlantic). 

Why are all these people so fucking angry that White and Asian kids got got denied from Yale or Harvard but aren’t outraged that Black students are only 7% of our student body but are only 13% of the US population? 

This is no way an attack on White or Asian students, or applicants. It is merely an expression of frustration that many of us are failing to acknowledge that despite all of these admissions policies Black (and Latinx) students still seem at a far greater disadvantage than other racial groups when we consider the application process as a whole. 

At best not acknowledging this is myopic, at worst, it’s racist."

Sorry for the long-winded title, but it’s quite a strange inquiry. My brother is in the process of applying to Harvard’s REA program for the Class of 2025 and is currently working on his Common Application. We saw that, in addition to his teachers and counselors, the ‘Other Recommendations’ section allows recommendations to be submitted from family members. 

I am currently a student at the College, and was wondering if writing a recommendation, if not even a narrative on our brotherhood, would meet this classification and also be appropriate. It seems like it may be unwelcome or strange, so I wanted to solicit the advice of Reddit to see where I should take that approach. 

I don’t believe I would write a traditional sort of recommendation either, in this case. Instead, I believe I would like to elaborate on my brother’s relationship to me, as we are only a few years apart and have often worked together on projects, from social justice to music. So, I think I would write more about how I believe he has always been an essential part to my work and life, and I have served the same role in his life. We are both FGLI and first-gen, and are avid political organizers, so discussing how our brotherhood has allowed us to flourish despite our disadvantages and nodding at how his presence at Harvard would be symbiotic for us both is more precisely the goal of my potential recommendation. 

I am certainly open for criticism, both on this approach and also in whether or not this type of family recommendation would be appropriate/beneficial for his application.

I am not a Harvard student myself, but a few things here confused me, and I was wondering whether anyone here would have insight into *why* some survey results are... the way they are.

• The number of students with an income of 500K+ seemed to hang around 13-14% for the classes of 2017/18, 15% for 2019/20, and 17% for 2021/22 (the class of 2023 had a “prefer not to say” option. Is this just inflation, is this trend insignificant, or is the number of ultra-rich students slowly creeping up?


• In the classes of 2017, 2018, and 2019, the % Jewish was 9.5, 9.8, and 10.1 respectively. Since then, it has not exceeded 7.7, with a new low of 5.3 for the class of 2023 (2022 was 5.4%). Is this response bias, or are fewer Jews matriculating?

• In the classes of 2017 and 2018, 12.5 and 12.8% of students had received mental health counseling. This number has crept up through the high-teens, and is now at 25.3% for the class of 2023, up from 21.8% for the class of 2022. Is this because of greater access to therapy, admissions changes, or a general societal trend?

• Most “National Politics” questions were “culture war” related, with some being *extremely*  niche. Why are there questions on transgender individuals in the military and separation of families at the border, but not a *single* question on education, healthcare, or economics? These are generally considered (along with climate change) to be the most mainstream voter issues.

I also wanted to say, the class of 2023 looks *quite* impressive. The whole report is fascinating as well — I am extremely impressed.

Thank you so much!"

It seems like a little thing to worry about, but not having student IDs is just another reminder about what we are missing out on by being online.

I have four classes. And my WiFi where I live is **awful**. It's awful to the point where I cannot stream a lecture nor attend any of them with any semblance of success. I cam't do HW without internet.

So, I walk to campus because it's the nearest place that I can walk that has WiFi and a great place to social distance. The Harvard WiFi is God-tier power. 

Plus, it's nice being on campus - it feels a little more 'normal'.

However, the tourists and people with their (screaming) children is making it harder and harder to be here and keep a distance. I've had children come up to where I'm working and start yelling to each other even though I'm 50 yards (at least) from the nearest person of usual tourist object of interest. I've been bumped into by tourists walking into me from behind me. 

I've had tourists get right near me because they think it's an ideal selfie spot.

Tourists are hanging around (granted, not in the numbers during a regular semester) and getting way too close no matter where you are.

Yesterday, I saw a woman let her child urinate on the grass in the middle of the Old Yard. Where people (like me) sit and study.

This may seem like a 'get off my lawn' complaint post and it likely is. But damn.

If they're going to be checking IDs at 5PM, let's just do it all day, maybe?"

It seems like a good move to limit legal liability and a bad move for public health. There will be a percentage of students that send back blank samples or don't follow the instructions well.


Also, what is Harvard's reporting requirements for cases? Would you want to know if your floor had active positive cases? From their PR department: Harvard will drop off a 7-day supply kit to positive cases in the dorms, and they recommend self-quarantine (unenforced honor system).

Dozens of community members, local workers, candidates for office, local officials, state legislators, and more will rally together with hundreds of Massachusettsans to declare loud and proud that we deserve better; that our dignity, our freedom, our livelihood, our security isn't a luxury, it's a right -- it's a cornerstone of the American Dream.

Some orgs that are our affiliates: Basic Income Boston, Massachusetts High School Democrats, MA Democrats, HeadCount, MassAlliance, and many more. And dozens of other organizations are set to come out in support of the rally very soon (including numerous unions, workers groups, family advocates, and more)!

Join us, and stand with our fellow Americans to fight for economic and social justice for the communities in Massachusetts and across the nation.

I am the CEO and founder of The  Neuroscience Fellowship.  This is an organization dedicated to teaching  neuroscience to younger students. We bring university level students  experienced in neuroscience to teach high school students interested in  the field. 

We are currently expanding to also include a student panel,  where students from universities across Canada and the US can answer  questions from high school students. The panel will be about university  life, how to study, post graduate life,  job opportunities etc.  It would be great if you are a neuroscience student, but we are more then happy to take on university students who are studying something else. 

Right now my team and I are looking for  panelists. If you are interested in sharing your experience with high  school students please fill out this form. This is a one time commitment, it  should not be too time demanding.  The panel will be this Saturday from 5-6:30 Pm EST.  If you are interested, please fill out this form.

Alright guys hear me out, we give the famous drink Mr.Pibb an honarary degree from this establishment to spite all those Dr.Pepper fans. They've been in a shortage of Dr.P for a bit but I think that's complete BS. My current hypotheseis is that all those Dr.Pepper fans and maybe even our own government have fabricated this conspiracy purely to increase the number of sales of Dr.Pepper. Looking back in American history, this pepper dude never even went to college nor did he come close to a PhD. It's time we end these lies and honor a true American hero. Mr.Pibb is like you and me, he started from the bottom and now he is here, a true all american who worked his way from a lower class home to the high class society. TRUE AMERICAN DREAM. Ever notice how Mr.Pibb hasn't been canceld, but just as the Epstien documentary dropped on Netflix Dr.Pepper suddenly had to be a victim and ""in a shortage"". LIES. Call my boy Alex Jones in here cause this is strait to the top. Mr.Pibb deserves this degree and here is my top 10 reasons why."

I decided to build a simple directory of the Best Remote Job Boards broken into categories (General, Development, Writing, Marketing, Sales, Freelance etc...), Tools and subreddits to help make it easier for people find remote work who are just starting out. There's even a section for Remote Jobs and Internships for Students 🎓

This site is a work in progress and any feedback would be greatly appreciated. If you know of any good job boards or additional resources, please share them below and I'll add them.

If any of you are interested in becoming a volunteer tutor, message me for info.

Some perks of being a tutor include volunteer hour certificates, awards, a personalized letter of rec, and most of all you're making a difference!

N. Gregory Mankiw said that wealth inequality is partly justified because smart people have better genes, which means they and their offspring deserve to be wealthier than the rest of us. That's the closest you can get to eugenics now-a-days without being kicked out of polite society. 

Henry Kissinger is a war criminal and we have no problem bringing that guy back for talks and visits year after year.  

A Harvard chemist, Louis Frederick Fieser**,** invented Napalm, a chemical weapon designed specifically to cause maximum destruction in the dense neighborhoods of wooden houses in Japan––that is like, textbook, comic book character, evil. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sure, all of those things are, um, not good, per se. Evil might be a bit of stretch for some of them, but bear with me while I develop this terrible argument.  But you know what all those guys had in common? 

They were super competent! 

Mankiw is one of the foremost economists in his field and former chief economic councilor to Bush. 

Kissinger is one of the most important political figures of the 20th century. 

Fieser was a professor emeritus, whose work lead to some of the biggest breakthroughs in modern medical history. 

&amp;#x200B;

If we were draw a graph where ""evil"" is the y-axis and competency is the x-axis, most of these guys are way out on the far right hand side of that graph. Sure they had some skeletons in their closets, some of them worse than others (looking at you Kissinger), but at least however evil they were was matched, if not outweighed, by their contributions to their field and Harvard's image. 

If we were to plot current Harvard Faculty on this chart David Kane would way way way too far up in the left corner to justify keeping his job. If Harvard's past faculty are any measure, Kane has accomplished nowhere near enough to justify how racist he is. I fully believe if he was any more accomplished in his field Harvard would be totally comfortable sweeping his racist ass blog under the rug for long enough to keep him on staff. 

What I truly do not understand is why Harvard is choosing to let this outlier, be this evil with this little achievement to his name. They guy worked in finance for 20 years before this, he is barely even an academic, it's not like he won a Nobel prize! 

What's more, his evilness makes him objectively worse at his job of being a data scientist, putting him even higher on the evil axis and even lower on the competency axis! How does he still have a job! 

Granted, this argument is awfully constructed and morally bankrupt, but I wanted to put in terms the administration could understand. 

David Kane and his racist homie Charles Murray have no business anywhere near this campus.    

TLDR: Kane is too racist and not accomplished enough for Harvard Admin to justify him still having a job

p.s. Don't bother ""informing"" me about due process and wrongful termination those are serious considerations and this is not a serious, or even well thought out post

p.p.s. don't bother whining that Mankiw, Kissinger, or Fieser aren't actually evil, this post is a joke and if that is your reaction to this post you are too"

When I break this down I noticed in the Udemy course there is more practice during lectures / encouragement to try concepts, before proceeding with lectures. I don’t think we get that in lecture with most teachers / certain subjects? I’ve had only one professor who did that and I was subpar in a class with 300 people.

We're the team at [Ensu](https://ensu.com/) and we're looking for Harvard students to help us with user testing as we look to build a free tool to help students with mental health.

We all go through a lot of shit in our lives, and it's super easy to feel like we're the only ones who are going through what we're going through. The fact is though that this isn't true, and there are a lot of other people who've also been through what we're currently facing, and have made it out the other side stronger. Something that helped me a lot (I've been through pretty severe depression and anxiety in the past) was the help I got from my friends at the time, even if they didn't really know exactly what to do or how to help.

We're building something to make it easier to help the people you care about in similar situations - all while being fully free!

For user testing, this will be a \~45 minute call with out Head of Product, [Chris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-robeck/), who will ask all sorts of random questions about mental health and interactions between friends, and we will compensate $10 for the call. We also have some longer term involvement options that we can touch base on at the end of the call.

If you're interested in helping out in testing, please please fill out this google form [https://forms.gle/YUWzgMkfGhtpPDjM8](https://forms.gle/YUWzgMkfGhtpPDjM8) and we'll get back to you very shortly with more information and details.

I was introduced to my ancestry this summer and I came to learn many interesting things, one of which being that there was a lineage of Harvard and Yale graduates. This was indeed a long time ago; the first of my ancestors to graduate Harvard was in 1693, followed by two of his sons in 1722 and 1735, and one graduating Yale in 1735. In addition, there was also a very close association between my family and the first overseer of Harvard that spans from the founding of the college in 1636. I came to discover this information myself through various published accounts of New England's history.

My ancestors later immigrated and founded a town in Canada sometime amidst the American Revolution. Growing up, no one ever taught me about the storyline of our ancestry. I suspect that they, for the most part, had no knowledge of any of this. My family did and still does have a tradition of being loyal Bruins and Red Sox fans, although for reasons they never quite knew why.

While I am not looking to be admitted into either of these schools, I was wondering what legacy implications there could be for my children in the future if they were to choose to pursue studies at either these institutions. When one declares legacy, is there space to expand on such lineage or is it simply a yes/no box that's ticked? Is legacy only valid if it is related to the school that one's parent(s) attended.

Hoping to receive some perspective on this matter from the current Ivy community.

Many thanks for taking the time to read."

They tested positive for the virus today, and I am testing Tuesday morning, though I am starting to feel sick. I am immunocompromised so there is an increased chance I'll be hit harder by the virus than most other college students. I am wondering what y'all think as to how I should deal with this in terms of my school work.

Normally, I wouldn't worry so much about school and being sick, but with finals coming up along with my immunocompromised status I am a bit conflicted. 

Should I go ahead and tell my professors about all that's happened even though I won't have my results until probably Friday? On the one hand, there's still a chance that I won't get too terribly sick and I'll be able to do my work alright. On the other, waiting til Friday could mean they won't understand what's happening if my symptoms get worse in the coming days. 
In general I feel bad because alot has happened this semester that has meant missed classes and turning in late responses. I've always been honest and talked to them in advance, but I still worry they think I am making excuses...


And even if I ignore what could happen to me, I already feel a great amount of anxiety as is. My boyfriend is also immunocompromised and his parents are older with health conditions. Not only that but my dad and stepmom tested positive on Friday. All that is happening is making working on school really hard.

I appreciate any advice you could give, and I'm emailing my house dean as well. TIA!"

Why did you set up the system that would force me into attending a 7:30 classes 3 times a week and rope me into getting five hours of sleep a night. Not to mention the slew of deadlines that happen at 2:00 pm my time which is a massive fuck you as well. 

Harvard has only done lip service to the idea of being inclusive to students in different time zones, especially considering how many students from California, Washington, Oregon, and Nevada attend Harvard. You think you could throw us a bone and just let us wake up after 8:00 am at the very least. 

On top of all that they just announced that students who"" **live in time zones four or more hours distant from Eastern Standard Time""** will be given housing priority. Again, a slap in the face to students they decided to fuck over with their own time zone rules. 

I get that there are a limits on the number of beds on campus and that administration wants to maintain some sense of normalcy with live lectures, but you also think they could stop and consider that a massive group of students on the west coast are being fucked over. Stop doing lip service to the idea that you care about time zone difficulties when you are disadvantaging every student who lives on the west coast.

I am a freshman who is going to concentrate in Neuroscience, on the MBB track, with a citation in Spanish. I've been doing a lot of thinking for next semester's course load and wanted someone (i.e. upperclassmen) to give their input on how hard they think my imagined course loads would be:

5 course route:

\- LS50b (counts as two courses)

\- Spanish 50

\- Expos 20 (unsure of which one yet)

\- Either Psych 16 (Developmental Psychology) or Psych 2485 (Bad Genes, Bad Parents, Bad Behavior - criminality and psychopathy class)

6 course route: 

\- Same as above but I would take both Psych 16 and Psych 2485 instead of choosing between the two. 

For context, this past semester I took LS50a, Psych 18 (Abnormal Psychology), and Spanish 40. Initially, I wasn't planning on taking Psych 2485, but since it'll be Buckholtz's last semester at Harvard, I really wanted to take another class with them since they were a phenomenal professor in Psych 18 and they made psychopathy sound like a really cool topic to study. However, I also really want to do Psych 16 next semester and so I'm torn and don't really want to have to make a choice between the two (especially since my 4 year plan is looking super packed already and I don't want to delay Psych 16).

tl;dr: 5 course route (two pset classes, expos, spanish, one psych course) or 6 course route (two pset classes, expos, spanish, two psych courses)?

Thanks in advance for any advice you can offer."

I've been thinking about this for a while, but especially, now that most of us are taking our classes online, this seems like the perfect time to make this idea a reality.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for constructive criticism on if you think this is a good idea? How can we can make it better and how could we do this in such a way that schools would actually agree to doing it.

&amp;#x200B;

**The idea**

It's very simple, you would continue attending Harvard as long as you take one credit a semester. You are free to take all your other courses at any other university.

&amp;#x200B;

**How does this Help students:** 

1. You still benefit from the intangibles of attending and getting a degree from Harvard (alumni network, signalling (aka you still get to tell people and post on your Linkedin that you went to Harvard), intramurals, clubs, friends,social events, library, gym, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

2. It's cheaper: Now, schools have to compete with other schools on courses offered. As opposed to schools only competing for freshman and once you join a school you are locked in to those courses. They would have to offer continuously offer competitive prices for all their courses.

&amp;#x200B;

3. You get better quality: Suppose you are taking an economics course at Yale. You are limited to learning from the economics professor at Yale. If there is an economics professor at Harvard you would prefer to learn from, sorry you're out of luck.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why Would Universities Agree to this?**

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest, they might not. In fact, I think that most univerisities would fight hard against doing this. This is not a moral failing, most educators want to help students, but their hands are tied by the Innovator's dillemma. (Fancy word for: they don't want to disrupt their business model in the short term even if it's better in the long term).

&amp;#x200B;

But I think that whatever school offers this first would have a massive first-mover advantage. Imagine that neither Harvard nor MIT allowed students to take full-time internships in the summer but instead, required students to take summer courses because it made the universities more money. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then Harvard decided to allow students to take summer internships. Eventually, MIT would start consistently losing out on hundreds of potential students every year who were choosing between Harvard and MIT, but chose Harvard because it allowed students to have internships.

&amp;#x200B;

I expect the same thing to happen with the Education Freedom Program (aside: that's the name I just came up with, what do you think about the name?)

&amp;#x200B;

Some schools would resist at first, but once some very smart schools realize that they can use this as a very compelling differentiated advantage to recruit students, then other schools can't afford to NOT offer this option.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to be very brief here since I know we have limited attention span but I go into more details here:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov-2Q-Mom4A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov-2Q-Mom4A)

&amp;#x200B;

So what do you think of this idea and how can we actually make this happen?"

I have a lot of time and am also interested in the CS/Applied Math-Ec concentration (although I don't have as much CS experience).

My planned schedule for the fall will look something like this:

If completed CS50:
Math (highest one I place into)
Ec 50
Expos (depending on whenever I get Expos)/Gen Ed
Language

If I don't complete CS50 I'll swap out Ec 50 for CS50. I'm also thinking about GOV 50 instead of Ec 50, could you also give me insight as to which of the two courses is better? Is this schedule balanced/good?

Thank you!"

I've noticed that club sports at some schools seem to be around the same level as high school varsity sports, with many even having their own coaching staff.  Is this what it's like for club sports at Harvard?

Also, I'm really interested in joining a club that will give the chance to travel around.  Do club sports travel to compete at other schools and/or participate in various tournaments?  I'm most interested in the men's club lacrosse, men's club soccer, and club squash teams, if that helps to give more info.

I'm a freshman that just finished up Math 25a, CS 61, Stat 110 and Ec10a, and am taking Math 25b, CS 124, CS 181 and Expos this spring. I'd love to hear about meaty STEM courses that are under-rated and worth taking, even if they aren't in math/CS (but especially welcome if they are). For example, I think AM 226 (Neural Computation) sounds like a hidden gem, and Physics 210 (GR) looks fascinating. I'd love to take both next year or as a junior. 

I'm planning on taking Math 118r (Dynamical Systems), Stat 210 (Graduate Probability) and MIT's 6.837 (Computer Graphics) next fall as a sophomore and doing economics research this summer, and would love to discover courses that people have enjoyed in the past, but that aren't ""common/standard"" STEM courses (I think Math 118r is another example of such a ""hidden gem"" of a topic). Chemistry, Econ courses etc also very welcome :)"

Many of us may be struggling with assignments, or maybe circumstances outside of university. When we go through the news, we see that people are suffering around the globe with a lack of essential things like water, food, etc. How would that feel like?

Now... we all yearn for success and we want to be happy. Why not make that person on the other side of the globe smile while you may not know them. That smile on their face from your contribution can result in something 'big' in your life unexpectedly. It could also result in your university success. That's powerful.

Many of us are struggling financially, but what if we can donate just $1 for the wellbeing of another person. Imagine how many families praying for your wellbeing during a crisis relief while you're doing an assignment. Maybe you might just figure out the answer quickly :) Don't belittle the $1. If 100 students can donate $1 out of goodness, then that $100 that can save plenty of lives/ families.

If we can all do this little thing, it can result in us being heroes in saving humanity. I mean, that's what makes us Harvard students. We work for the better good of humanity. 

I'm not representing any foundation. Just a person who want you and others to be successful."

Hey there, I am the developer of B4Grad, a mobile app I started developing while I was doing my undergrad.

[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/b4grad-your-student-agenda/id1352751059?mt=8](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/b4grad-your-student-agenda/id1352751059?mt=8)

B4Grad has since grown and we got a major boost by the pandemic that the world has been facing.

We are looking for students to test the product as we launch several new features this upcoming semester including our note editor. You can send us the feedback via email or write a review on the App Store. That’s it.

And in exchange, we’ll give you the premium version of the app for free. It’s that simple. Just email us on the App Store page or you could message me here on reddit.

So a little more background here- I actually built B4Grad with the intention of making school simple to organize. I always felt like every professor in my program had a different style of doing things, and I thought an agenda wasn’t good enough of a tool.

I hope that B4Grad can serve as a good solution to that problem for some of you. Let me know if it has. 

Thank you 🙏"

I'll start with a couple of my own. Phil 34, ""Existentialism in Literature and Film,"" is a great introduction to philosophy, and really changed my outlook on life in general.

Friends can be a blessing or a burden depending on whether they encourage you to do good and motivate you along the way with optimism or not. 

For those true friends out there, take some time to ask about your other friends.

Maybe ask how they're doing, do a zoom call, or something else just to put a smile on their face and make their day. 

The unfortunate reality is that we think that we have to dedicate so much time for friends. That's not true. It's better to ask and contact from time to time rather than making them feel forgotten.

You know, I had some great friends in the past, but because of how busy life is and lost contact info, I never heard back from them and I just really wish I could talk to them again. 

Share good and bad times, make the effort to continue through life in the best possible way we can be, and do not just hang out to fool around. I had friends who never bothered to ask how I was doing even though there are no issues between us. It's just the reason of ""We were busy.""

I'm sharing this to encourage others not to do the same mistake. Don't forget a friend, always make them feel remembered and encourage them to do good. 

Lastly, try to meet people who will be good for you and encourage righteousness. They may fill that void if a friend forgets you. They might even be better friends."

We would like to open up a discussion about Rule 2 of the sub. This is a checkup to make sure it reflects the needs and desires of this subreddit. This isn't in response to a particular event; this is just something we have come across several times and I figure it would be best to just let everyone discuss it and come to a consensus (if that's not too optimistic). 

As of this post, rule 2 is:

&gt; 2) No advertising or soliciting non-Harvard sponsored products, apps, surveys, or other materials.*
&gt; 
&gt; *: Special arrangements can be made to advertise officially recognized events and organizations directly related to Harvard subject to moderator approval. Contact the moderators directly to inquire.
&gt; 

This rule is meant to filter posts that advertise things.

The wording and conditions of Rule 2 have changed slightly over the years; for a while it was just ""No advertising or soliciting""; then we added ""of non-Harvard sponsored ...""; then we added the asterisk. The original intent of the rule was to filter out spammy posts advertising because of the subreddit's name and reputation. However, there are of course legitimate things to advertise so we had to figure out how to best draw the line, hence all the changes. 

---

As it stands, the current rule requires that any person or organization not officially recognized by the University seek moderator approval before advertising an event, service, opportunity, etc. There have been plenty of queries that we've denied, but there have been some that we have approved. The MO for our decision-making is: ""is this advertisement useful, relevant, and legitimate?"" For example, the [Jeopardy!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/jo2g8j/the_jeopardy_national_college_championship/) post was useful, relevant, and legitimate. However, there are some advertisements that we don't think meet those criteria (e.g. a high school tutoring company seeking to hire Harvard student tutors). We believe something like that crosses the line into spam and/or reputation-seeking. 

Please chime in below with your thoughts on the current rule, and if there are any changes or tweaks you would like to see. For example, do you agree with the two instances I gave above?

---

*Keep in mind that the primary purpose of this subreddit is to serve current Harvard students and alumni (though we do welcome people from other colleges, prospectives, etc to interact). As such, we will only consider feedback from students and alumni in this thread (no, we don't have a verification system; we just know who they are :))*"
